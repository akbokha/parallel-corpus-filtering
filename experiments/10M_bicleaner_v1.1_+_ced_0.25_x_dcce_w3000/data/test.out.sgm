<seg id="1">Clintons und Trumptions economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this is just Clinton as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unone is however the two US presidential policy, however, in tax and energy policies, as well as in a basic request.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to be small in doubt and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton had to punish the economy of death and regulating death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different from the other hand, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will retraced regulations, and he makes himself strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax treasures - for both business people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton who says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has to open quite disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the misses to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost wortequal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants are not the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Tealy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there may be an independent internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive the coal sales in the United States again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, Clinton wants to expand into renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create the clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">However, not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far away from one another.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziic trade deal, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be also better paid for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger pittance.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What does not want to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must move, then he says, he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Allianz of foreigners"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight months-long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes in receipt, I cannot refuse the expression of expression that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles richer and it is hardly any heat made up, even for its cautious conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan he repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report full of five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin out-ray, lasting coolness showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from response to time was waged.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia to be back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even bigger, since it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long led the state-controlled media a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would have to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the serious allegations, the allegations of conductors were that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas Syriza, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has argued this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was accepted by the President Erdogan the Entschuldigung he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire is clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily required for all friends who can get after it last month at a failed state coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terror attack on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recorded again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a delay of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week prognostic the state TV, cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agriculture will be re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti-shaped it as follows: "tourists staying there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West as it's reaction to the attempted power of power considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this is the ongoing Groll on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin despired to benefit from cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus that he sought after the failed state support for the elected government.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well known for Moscow as a matter of course, that itself has a profound fear of regimepers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glossary palace made it possible to Russia and Turkey, one as it was once described as analysts once described, "alliance of external outsiders": two countries that come from the West and are being treated badly and contexed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still great differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference between Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support antagonistic sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours in preliminary talks both President on the press conference said that they didn't even grasp the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey remied it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months more open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, when NATO-member Turkey won the Russian fighter jet, it certainly is better that the two leaders at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="17">Each of these trademarks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely and our employees are working with the customer under these brands.</seg>

<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, for how do we focus in the interior (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the chief manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical ago three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin feuds Stabat Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpectant his staff of Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years of the narrow trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old appointed for the Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged without stating reasons "the dismissal Ivanovs from his duties as the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was since 2012 Ivanov's deputy, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion on the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (upon Russian) that he had later been the executive director of the government director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as a state of state on law enforcement and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin asked the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked about to leave his job and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious woven.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest ties of Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on television it claimed both men that the Stef head had resumed on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was formerly known as a potentially president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - stain on great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, being quoted on the website of the Kremlin, said Ivanov "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to trust me this very complicated post - you could say almost - complaining about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post of December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was deputy prime minister and defense ministers.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a member of the Public Safety Services.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Bundessicherhusement (FSB), he replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his representative.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third presidential coup against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, nearby allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was elected President, before he was elected president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the Brückentck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the pasing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the entire Brückcks are at their place and the last section of the Decks, today in Rosyth place a begguss for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green Party: investors will continue to be much stronger in the future in future.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A provision is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD's presidents Christoph Bratmann believes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build up to urban areas now has 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to get toughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, so Bratmann, bane, there is a tightening of the situation on the market-market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program is not entirely clear: the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of other about 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will run within the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, as the planniolitic Sprecherin Nicole Palm, should now be baptized out of the city now.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: this will not want the owners, the housing corporations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer home to play outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, screened in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games, and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters which initially create for the video games in the 1990s (later, a string series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the population, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand were slightly from the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon had better users as a ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphones and are looking for Pokémons which are following with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users recently investigated that within two days of launch of the game, the number of people followed by people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company don't know who plays from Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for the enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health people want to bring" "" "30 minutes" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "to be active" "" "from the sofa" "" "because many public messages are boring and who come from people who look" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport can not be reassessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives regularly sport is reduced its chances to mitigate cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in proper control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Consequently, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also the Styrian playsite, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its stimulus and the use will be made with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activites are combined in the real world and thereby are helping many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I put in the gymnastores in the gymnasium and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been there for 1984 at any summer seasade and the US have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnerves, Simone Les, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie, Hernandez, which were inspired to many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin ist and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, is complete, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has established the black and hispanic female presence at the top of these sports.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female Turnerves was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was celebrating a surprise Olympics and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple Worldchampionship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it unexpected, nevertheless masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American writer, who won a single multi-election event for women Gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of these sports, but such results are not visible throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie bees all the same route as Aly and Madison to create it into the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "" "" last Five "" "," because the next Olympics are only four gymnast within the team. it's also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily staying in private trainers who are maintained by parents, which are intended for training, classifieds, competitive, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list is able to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts lie in a wealthy suburbs who can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, the gymnasts given its entire training and that is for the families a most expensive and long-term engagement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Les, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since they started with the turfs.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired to the municipalities to numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easily accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my meetings we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for about 15.000 urbane juveniles (mainly black and Hispanic) offered and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown), to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination to the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for the education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this crew, who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team and thank you that motivates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="13">The bma wants to make a better weekday remuneration for the 54,000 assistants that will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director of the NHS employees, called for the assistant to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "working conditions do not reach anything but little, but already burdened teams and service providers, and prepare the patients, priests and their families only worries, hardship and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of the assistant and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries to respond positively to concerns about the premundancy and whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge, flexibility for training, training and education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training and the gender Ministry for Education, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the bma in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British passport undermined its immune system and litigation of a serious investigation - by taking some of the most dirty and eceldest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and touchtor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk schabed his course on a euro bill, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilibility of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leaks of each object he used a Luminometer for himself and to show us what he is going to let itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to recede the dishknob of a train toilette, which was already used by thousands of others, may seem completely repulsive, but actually reside in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Wright through Europe talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, none of them left its speckled, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilibility of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate a peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public transportation to railway stations up to dishwasher code, the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movie he told me, "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he turns, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its line-line showed a Luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometres amounts to only less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to recede, after its Luminometric number over 4000 units was, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "this is what I have to be in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">The company has Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>

<seg id="26">You claim that the interest in gut health is going to become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, which led the director of the film, added: "let me have lost me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, which I have instructed to slick it, like the ecolous Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things which it was easier to bring Ian to skate it and others with which this was rather difficult.</seg>

<seg id="33">In one of Valio conducted survey from 2015 associated 84 percent of all respondents lactobacillus in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intestinal and 58 per cent said that they are using at least occasionally products used to include lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Orchesterdig, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelic conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," warmed him.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that they are very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this staging Maroli plays an older gestud Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She works with melancholy to her lovers with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dance.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there is Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel Pretty, oh so Pretty, I feel Pretty and witty and Bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"she resembles me very, my Italian character, which I found as the Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of Lobos for the operator: Cecilia is a wonderful artist. "</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously normal man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Dirigid is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">There is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, this is really important!</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "for the American filmmaker Philip cup. McKinley, the" West Side Story "" "" is currently up-to-date: "" "" this piece about prejudices and fanaticism "" "." "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not purchase ballamps?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age 55 plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you are commenting to the commentage, to oversow him under the pseudonym non-session defects with rinsults, this statement directs from the current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the proclaiming recovery of sound is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to greet the creation of physical objects but to the Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record, are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely shrubs.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older platters retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble deception trage and wild gestuere before I stop my hands and tell something like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly running to its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mixes through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed by Sister Ray (Number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (Number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the stores to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approximately 3.000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These silks, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford as they appeared and again bought objects that he sold when he was young and pleaded.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I sell are from the late 1960s, early 70ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who are buying the plates, more introverted and like to spend their own time, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my case.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets he meets the YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and visualize, to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have been sent to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once bought their plates to buy CDs now buy their CDs to get back their plates, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the inappropriate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realize that records are a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the latest fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw himself to the stability of confidential sound spheres, of objects, the happy youth-deposits.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions than a sort of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors and I think it's so with lots of people so much.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "we are an employee of a record-stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who own a record, do not have turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I have flowered with a stack in Bossa Nova Compass.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (numbers: three men in middle age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radial plate, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-duty, less musiklasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which will not come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp which has dedicated the sound boards almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I rewind.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women of middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Beasts new synthesizer and sextpackter pop instead of experimental jazz, from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks especially lonely, but nagging psychological sormata are hard to adjustable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs in business for several minutes and looked at the variation of the plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window ortal than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They do not deserve much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or another, but the beauty of records is... "it is driving with a distorted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business from which it is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance, the jeans-Hotpants to patterns, observe a group of young teenagers, for a moment for Polaroid cameras, before a father and daughter to consider to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to put it into.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnart."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could give some customers in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research announces that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records, which exist in reality, records and in Onlinefors.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer the rigid view of an uncanny, 30 years old moderator, who has waged over the shoulders of anything middle age.</seg>

<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even though it was only the Beiden who sat at the Ruins, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present as they were on the second of the Olympiagold in a row, followed by the first women in the history of the British Sports, who laid up such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.ter untrained commitment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins set about the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not reflected the type of triumphs to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the ruin, a battalion contribute to willing to make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach, which would not survive 30 months ago, whether he would survive this day when they were diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had stomach cancer, who is operational and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty little situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off the season, could start what the interruption kept to a minimum if that is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rod itself is a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infinitability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve firing morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied her whole life: as young girl she had accompanied her whole life: as young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher studies, she defeated the fur of music, and now the 78-year-old in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotionally and physically," describes her.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample, it feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she is doing a good thing with her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is the same from several perspectives an amazing hobby for seniors, says Erhard packler by the German Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular contexts, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures emerge at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "align and organize themselves on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, mean hacke.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lungs regularly, also in everyday life not as fast as the buste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">To older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz, says of the Federal Labour community of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people awakened many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Inspired by lyrics and particularly melodies, people themselves dashamed about long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, the head is also required for a special performance, declares the sequence.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly who live alone, practice so not just to concentrate on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long been for something, I will get better and watchse beyond me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You sings not sings alone - at 50 Sinful people who hear who sounds like a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the suitable offer seniors different possibilities, says hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer Overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can be found also via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors will ask for help with the internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who wants to sing, should join in a choir, called hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something freading - this is true of any age.</seg>

<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Executive Committee, secret services, and of the Wehrbudget Commites, reported of great discontent among Central Command secret services, reported on how pre-ordinances expressed its assessments to the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military situations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news services, which were typically replicated by high-level CentCom Commandeuren in a regular basis, recorded a more positive image of the US efforts against terrorism as it would have enabled the actual statuses on the spot, and have been incomparably more positive than analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what has happened in CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders, Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The executive error in the CentCom are reaching as the top head of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report summarises detailed problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence of fact that government tips given under Obama statements, shows how analysts got exposed to their forelaws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half year 2015, many Central Command Press releases, opinions and statements before Congress clearly states more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom attempts are publicly known that a military re-conquest of Mossuls can already start in April or May 2015.</seg>

<seg id="15">Republicans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were concerned with regards to the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, further investigations of the CentCom reports are in progress by the general law of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the message service provider on Thursday released their own findings, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom acquired a re-restricted process for creating detrimental evaluations to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the first-day democrat in the committee, member of Representatives Adam B. ship, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Ships," "" "postponed the publication of detrimental reports," "" "ashamed the morals among analysts and" "" "gave overly little space for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported by the General Assembly of the Pentagon, which were received by the complaints of CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment reports of Congress, while the investigations of general inspectors still be still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also gave that" "" "experts sometimes quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of more complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence did a controversy discussion of this important topics of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has continued effects on the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, allegations of last year, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honorable estimations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis-regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critique of the hearing about the Islamic State recall the disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing about how the damaging government headed by George W. Bush on the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker after statement of government agencies, that contrary to the statements made by government airstrikes against the terrorist group would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries were taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commands, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had poured three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Fhockey team of women in a match on Thursday to India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>

<seg id="6">But that knows them: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will last on Saturday in the final play of the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will set the strong Dutch make a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may be going on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">It grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (their two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the goings in the first half of the game with a backhand from the closeness.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone out in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprising, and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and finished the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last district.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the pkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs that had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inevitable, a rapid season between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the olympic fackel itself would have a burning stoves that will protect from the wristinlet to swimmers to the turner of the triathlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn off the television to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in queues in the coffee shop, without via Simone Les, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female swarm with grins, could well have been sent among these known names, built up to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-sensitive advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fiction.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not illuminated any event identical.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shoot, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it rule for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention on the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline already has been an olympic event, when it had in Sydney his debut, it has been noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasporttype at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This might also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the U.S. Athleten sent to competition, there has never been a medal jump in the trampoline, and until 2012 has had an athlete which has made it up to the dudrunde.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Bell from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unresolved ear school for a clownsschule than those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never perish specimen - but also the Grazie of the gym and pigeon containing two sports which it combines essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging Sieger jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to cross a number of falling movements (turning, rear and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be assessed according to official Olympiaprogram to the execution of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-made athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are together in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medals must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and draught, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not only do you chase the Ziellinie or the Initial wall, but also in the TV transmission: that of the world or the Olympiarekord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to get even a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel when looking at these games as something would be tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This rebounder offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A Prewardly movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt from, apparently weightless as an astronaut, go up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no sore point in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant case of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is such Zen how the competition can be only on the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and Endrunden of women will be held on Friday afternoon, Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is radiating the ducks as part of a afternoon bloc on both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked this in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the awareness auction can only be achieved through the attaching and the lens of male athletes, as it was the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expected his to air rinse, new fanfare.</seg>

<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, get as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new swing in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, the dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or in the times of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous grievances that cover anything from the ground-use up to the strangling in relation to the power of the governed coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a secondary election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zacked, controversial line in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden have been imposed more or less on the past few years, protecting turbulences and rearmament themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of Verbitterness after years of surrender to the surface is now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing in regular intervals, most importantly in protests, many people can still communicate over Internet Proxies which conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons of prosperous, the Amharas, who come from ether, predominantly in Christian high-countries, in politics and economics, while they explores the Oromos, of which many Muslims live and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen" "", "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests occurred in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who dominates around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the Secret Services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion, was to his death on a publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactic genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in using early signs of discontent and to use special officers in order to edit opponents and make it inharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian of new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relative for reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the controlled security services rendered by the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was created such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the statements of analyst seem to be fuelled from the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps many protesters were killed, even if it had been less than in the last months and that time of unrest was relatively fast over.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "development of development experts, Ethiopian Ethiopia and leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new swing-head, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy on Friday repeating his campaign by realizing that his multiple repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying new questions about the communication skills of the Presidents republicans to whether he is able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings up his collaborators who try to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to be explained to the peculiar position of declaring that he could not have.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at a election event held on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump done in regards to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn't intend to implied that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation totally seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement something weakened by doing it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican President will not know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The final storm of criticism prasselt to Mr. Trump as he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to decaying envelopes to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mistaken on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he did not find their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already taken sarcasm to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he preferred strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians were supposed to hack at Mrs. Clintons Eemails, but later I said "Natarlich I mean the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the boundaries of the boundaries in politics and then move back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages can be absorbed by his fans, as they arrive, and then possibly" clear "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vage enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of entrusted the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even estimated sound, as his contemporaries have continued to go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was released on Friday showed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologise himself for his provocative expression, he frequently asked his critics to distort his statements or falsify their humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he stands in focus of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Try Scherze had brought his loyal co-operas into the uncomfortable situation brought to him, irrespective of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, he said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called her butcher, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, held in Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister, ISIS may have allowed to spread it to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and bowed them to ride on each of his words and taken him biased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland: the oldest whale animal is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie usually only come to the finish in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie got only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Superfically flown at the bottom of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic at an hour, it reaches an average of 1,220 feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a robe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This von Langloneliness does not seem to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate from Greenlandai, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which for spans means a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though, the evolutionary biologist was already long that Greenlandhaie are stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just failed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are hard to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive on the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenlandhaie researchers do not know accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pento corn moderation them, when they set up six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot does this Haie nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jaw of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleepy animals or patrol in the bottom of the Iceferes and are looking for Kadaver, who are torches out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14-method the linsencore of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eyepiano is already created before the birth of the Haie, the proteins are later no longer redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a great deal of carbon-14 in the linens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon-attempt large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length of the smallest animal, the linens attempt to try a low overshot of carbon-14 from the atomic structure, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Grönland had normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeters long Greenland hai an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters can be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only then get off when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers of the length could assign a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals reached with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold to the sex ripe and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenlandhae was obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this is likely to be a world record for spins.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record label, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose speck at the Naked a 120 year old harp-pointed-pointed, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures also, the organism that live there are animals on sparflamme.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal temperate heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as early as possible as possible as possible as possible." explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should use its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer from Expressors-Malware currently have targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of Malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been at least once, partially repeatedly victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a reansomware compresby.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims made ready by the bag requested by the perpetrators of using the systems and data submitted.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators do their represso software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Are they successful there, the potential for compelling ransom will be much higher than with private user.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the damage software," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, the perpetrator blackmailing software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users had the goal, but the change to company Wacken took place in the past months quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple sample: once on the computer of a victim, it looks for a long changed file like Wordsearch, Excelor or database files as well as on archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encoded the Ransomware and clears the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the requirements of the compresses.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files you need to transfer the victim money - mostly in the form of cracks in Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where to play a personal photo-database on the game, it goes to companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is falling when a raansomware is proposing.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the companies affected by the companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely break the business, in any case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack, whose patients could be threatened by the loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say to the victims always, you are not paying for the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in operation in the face of breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers of F-Secure has investigated user-surfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their sacrifices by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, direct support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And we will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must pay partly hard and pay five-digit sums in order to regain their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the hansomware compresin, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains security professionals Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus providers of Sophos: "a single person can write a coansomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their polluting software then in the form of a software building on the actual appearance.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previously developed malware kit, created by the malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed cost between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in the scope is a adaptability, such that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Chniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Alchemser are then looking for another hacker to disseminate the freshly selling software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logically logged in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a crime and instrued another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per incremental calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals bear the crime with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies who can better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the firms in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can rely on file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful reessation, the offenders instead do with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The damage, depending on the type of data the damage is even more than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could use completely new goals on the internet of things on the corn.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerconference Defcon illustrated safety researchers how they could get a thermostat under their control over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activeness of such a block-block heating of such manpower might be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one stands forever, while in the evening it is unparalleled, in the morning it is still far ahead of the wake-up of sleep, no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has problems with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institut has about a quarter of adult sleep and more than ten percent of their sleep often or permanently recovering.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping troubles or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders and there are multiple causes of underlying causes, Hans-Günter Weeks, director of the German Society for SchlafResearch and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands inevitably, but the insomnia is, therefore an input and asleasleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Straight the asleep most people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, director manager at the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or contaminated factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early in the wake is often during a depression," says Weabia.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors want to face another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has a slice incident, can lie bad, wacht every two to three hours and dosibly critively, on all day-to-day problems and worry, there is one example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one go to your doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not asleep over a period of a month at least three nights per week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, councils.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very differently: one is abbeaten but tired, unsignposted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood or physical complaints such as gastric or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep interrupting, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things are behavioural patterns, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic bedlinen, only in the case of use and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dutch medical practitioner does not exist in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary medical center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep, one should first turn to the veterinarian, councils.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can be clarified with studies, whether problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into the laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the laboratory of medical laboratory physicians, for example in snoring with respiratory diseases, in sicknesses or if you cannot find the cause of a leasleep disorder, Fiemasons.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make a midday sheep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the crow, one goes to his normal time into the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body you are carrying a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get the problems into the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weaver counts on: regular sleeping and resides, not too long in bed, do not sleep away at night sleeping, alcohol, and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely and certainly not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">One passes the road from east to west, one gets to playground, a freshly knitted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house someone has ugly!</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: up to 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trenrich city," as the zuconstant property company called Friedrichshain, are to be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ground is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied by now, the residents have rented apartments, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel has been repeatedly declared for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">Once on June 22nd, the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, made with 300 police officials, according to 300 police officers, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the ground, block parts of the street and kept visitors from going to the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later moved police and construction workers under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents are walking with children, and people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others entertained at vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a foundational school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main avenue of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the area since 1999, and Jana *, which are three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about rising Miets and centrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound by an Kiez that is a majority of polymes before vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin conductor and the police between the landowners and their neighbours, exists so obviously not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average income and has high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home occupations and the resulting living projects are long since the region: 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Street, close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstrezer has been vacillated under a large police station, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming the magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them native inhabitants of the GDR-Time and former homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rental, which has grown by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them on configured slices or fresh repainted facades, which were subjected to colour.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned so often together with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours are considered to be a problem, it might not necessarily be affected by crime, crimes, such as bodily injury, statistics reveal that almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make the damage, the tenant rather the newbuildings and newly renovated houses meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who for 17 years in a hiberhouse next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is most important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, those were not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rigaer longer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary, "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has become aware of the Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the inhabitants get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the clearness about the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by secured newbuildings in former buildings, who suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="37">For those who like to have red-bombs, Kerstin has little Neugebauer little understanding: the house projects and the leftist scene belonged to the region.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogics team supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as contact for all players: refugees, working and refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else would be mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is here, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, who has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less hurting as rather on the variety of challenges they wish - meant that administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a superior Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network value.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point on three years fixed.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle honours and main actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers can be found at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A severe problem has been to find apartments for some time, apartments for the junction who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">In charge of the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, the rent or the renovation of these properties need to carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the trade office on the municipalities and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search had been designed to be very difficult for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far you don't have to rely on private apartments, so dress.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the apartments must be exposed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing way.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, are Regine Client and Annika Deuschle unified.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a steady lead, there are practitioners, training places, training courses, One-Euro jobs and payout activities for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help domestic-power, carry-profit work - and this motivates and very neat how Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community has led to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "in employment" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day provides a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a dependency.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, also here administration and honorary-honorary.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the trial is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they need to declare to the refugees that it is just taking it and they can be sensible at the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The substantial majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but problem incidents there are also, says customer honestly," "" "guys, where nothing is going on." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrence of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine Client quite clearly," "" "what mancher can call naïve" "". "a residual risk could not be ruled out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitised the helpers were already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks put them entirely in release.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary needs to hold out in the region and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always keep in the background that soon a new bang would come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, we scrub politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on the spot.</seg>

<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher also worked out with it to properly integrate the past people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need they can help them, both women agree.</seg>
