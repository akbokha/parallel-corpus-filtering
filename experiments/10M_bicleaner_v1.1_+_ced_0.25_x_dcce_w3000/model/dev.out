Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ ran@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the meeting , however , it should also take about the conflict with the Palestinians and the co @-@ discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous sett@@ ling of Israel and casts a swi@@ m@@ ative will in the peace process .
through the death of Obama talking about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relation of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of Republi@@ can in front of the US congress which was designated as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the upcoming election in Israel .
in a call , Professor , his girlfriend were shot to have shot
on a call was Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a something delicate voice of the police , that he was shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the fam@@ ine of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials find the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that was made on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was after details of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was transported to the police a popular histor@@ ian , E@@ than Schmidt , on the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ v@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that Univers@@ ité Ac@@ cordi@@ ally heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the for@@ s@@ ful emergency situation at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb before the police took him , when the police officers .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
those published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teacher .
students said that they were on his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said , he did not have history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both planted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ators 17 members includes , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations on problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised that he was also a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that lam@@ b told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb previously had the Delta State University to be asked for health reasons for health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he set up only two online courses .
last changes in the employment policy of the university was meant that the doc@@ toral degree have worked so hard for the Lamb , for him would not represent a guarantee of an automatic approach to a Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight from campus the police found Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Ark@@ ans@@ as again in the Mississippi river .
before he could be arrested , he was scr@@ ap@@ ed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he pro@@ mo@@ ated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs picked him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and a lam@@ b was 20 when they met together by joint friends .
they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her guitar playing .
he was at the time of women s@@ warm .
all girls f@@ mol@@ t by that when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson fo@@ aming of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were left 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he did not meet , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb is interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred both three years ago both on a summer time .
later they played together one or another G@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter write and sing her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes under@@ floor Co@@ ordinator of The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near the Gau@@ tier , said that he finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ harmon@@ ic game in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there were no evidence that anything did not vote .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the au@@ c@@ ams and j@@ ars together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the Elec@@ toral Programme and specialized in American native inhabitants and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Br@@ otherhood and the Stu@@ dents .
on Tuesday evening of the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland took part in the Tuesday evening approximately 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ lit ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ mal section , during the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are taken up on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans extru@@ ded to this report .
this story has been corrected to conf@@ ess that the police now says that he had shot the emergency , and that lam@@ b said in its call Pr@@ ent@@ is indeed his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever got married .
Toys R 4U plans to set up less man@@ power for the Christmas time

Michael J. Fox An@@ gle over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the Roy@@ als , and I know that the seat next to me is empty , and it will slowly become clear that Princess Diana is sitting beside me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me to the sense that I am a simul@@ ated gri@@ m and a ban@@ ger length of it , with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director of Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and leader of Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia has reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the agreed UN Security Council to join and to support an inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday , that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the council session in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions within the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Swoboda called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated against Iran in the achievement of nuclear power . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ duc@@ tions that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to mark him as a flop @-@ brand marks .
others did it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper races in surveys down , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double dig@@ it area , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the estate market .
of course it is too soon in the election period .
nobody maintains that wearing probably will win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts empha@@ size that at that time in the year 2011 , Rick &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which no one won even a state in the nomin@@ ation process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ ans Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump@@ eding Th@@ ink and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period :
Tr@@ ump@@ ing@@ Pop@@ ular specifications have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ ature mid @-@ June announced , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans looked in the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l .
until the middle of July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
right now , six of 10 ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative attitude .
and these figures differ in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac adjustment in I@@ owa has stated last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P &apos;s voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son takes about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ ans Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans sees m@@ umps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for their bom@@ b@@ astic and pres@@ um@@ erable statements , 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans tend to have the right temper@@ ament for a president , N@@ ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first choice of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that it has the personality for a command@@ ing officer , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his position , and nearly six of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament does not cast into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put their schol@@ ars , republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked to win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this has been a change since the time when four out of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past were not the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans were thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters are considered ch@@ att@@ ing campaign .
even when the Republi@@ can rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have gathered around another candidate , it runs almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the frag@@ mentation field probably contributes to m@@ umps &apos;s leadership , distributed during anti @-@ cl@@ ump support on more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that at a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump are harvest@@ ed multi @-@ embr@@ ac@@ ing support .
in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points prot@@ ru@@ sion , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points , and finally front of edge Paul , John Ka@@ die and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ hau@@ l the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head of mind .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support tr@@ ump will tell that they have to forgive her votes .
of course , a lot has to happen in order to change it , and no one can truly say the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ ump@@ y is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their mind , are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are in agreement with the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum for the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is crucial to withdraw from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are agre@@ es with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light will remain , it will seem to work on Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s upon new peak .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry on Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &apos; dis@@ satisfied &apos; and 21 percent &apos; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ z
doubt Tor@@ p@@ ze in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern den Weg zu a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran .
a sou@@ se@@ er the Champions League of the Champions League .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have launched a dream@@ start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; line of Piraeus .
the crew of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her pre@@ l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek Rek@@ ord@@ master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th anniversary of the series is to be the first step in the final direction of the Final on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wanted to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich on the third day .
Müller received during his 28th place in the Champions League at Bavaria &apos;s leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass one as the flan@@ k thought of the world &apos;s g@@ uss .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; had promised Bavaria Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ akis stadium before 3@@ 1,6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the Mün@@ chner stopped .
they showed a concentrated and engaged performance , without sh@@ iny .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven euro@@ pe@@ an @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim .
they went gr@@ ac@@ tly , with their eager efforts but often to come to fru@@ stration .
the attacks have been led to often per line @-@ moving on Lin@@ ks@@ abroad Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ forced against the earlier Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ ou@@ i .
Müller took on the right more luck , when his side bur@@ sts from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion of the possible 2 : 0 .
best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown attacked the he@@ ball from Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by Direct , the go@@ al@@ were Roberto with the knee par@@ ised ( 35@@ . ) .
although Bavaria was able to domin@@ ate their usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set up needle .
on Tor@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was Lost .
so approximately , as he made a shot of inv@@ ali@@ ye about the lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ c@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside .
the WM hero just gave after the final training green light , said Sport@@ pre @-@ stand Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else out of it , that is bad . &quot;
on the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he launched King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller took a dr@@ on .
in front of the game , it was drawn in the stadium onto Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly frigh@@ tened Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience , apparently the supporters of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and ge@@ stu@@ res had prov@@ okes the security forces , and went with head@@ b@@ loc@@ s against the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least a Bayern fan was wo@@ unded from the stadium .
who smok@@ es , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smok@@ es , at that not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er term study near .
the good news : when compar@@ isons the risk dimin@@ ished .
smok@@ ers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is made out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutr@@ ition@@ ists ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , smoking is no risk losing their teeth in order to lose weight - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had more than 23,@@ 300 participants observed .
root causes of tooth dec@@ ay be tooth dec@@ ay and inflammation of the fl@@ esh@@ y , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between cigar@@ ette smoking and bal@@ loss is therefore going back to most commonly denti@@ als in smoking .
not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth dec@@ ay .
people who heard with smoking , could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take , however , over ten years until the haz@@ ards brought back to the level of non @-@ smok@@ ers , declared first author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can convince people of convinced non@@ smoking , stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoke short@@ ens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good tooth health down to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 is affected by tooth loss , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking had the risk for early diagnosis of dental damage .
the new long @-@ term study bear@@ er the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
on the improvement of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions to disputes between corporations and states are to be dis@@ solved by a transparent background that is clearly more traditional in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to push the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Schwe@@ din has to launch the proposal as a European negotiating position in the trade &apos;s free trade agreement with the US .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is to create the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ est@@ ely suggest that EU states and the US have worked together independent judges for a new investment Court .
they are supposed to have equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , it is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ gement obj@@ ection .
so far the proc@@ ed@@ backs took up each other on a refer@@ ee , a crime against its jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it is intended to work for its own information to an International Investment Court .

Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart based on the shy folk rep@@ ut@@ ors recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fil@@ tering .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost sei@@ zed by Stev@@ ens .
it relates to various places he always shown on the map and present his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and tender songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative er@@ rer .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appeared smart songs that harmon@@ ious very close to American Folk in the late six@@ ties but at all times a great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting .
it arises the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a hiding series : each of the 50 US federal states will be as a consequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , already in 2004 and in the RV@@ BR are already published &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces Stev@@ ens here on .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
mit &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Illin@@ oise &quot; ) will be published in 2005 as a super@@ ficial competition .
super@@ l@@ ord@@ ant on ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic Fin@@ esse .
the album rises a charts in the US Bill@@ board and lacks a list of influ@@ ential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Mr. Stev@@ ens then served himself onto &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this six@@ ty studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but carried from programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
for long ago the smaller clubs resulting , the stages shows are shown here to the colour@@ ful spectac@@ le from the ne@@ on forehead , and great fluores@@ cent bul@@ le@@ de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens was part of a five @-@ piece band through Germany .
in the dark@@ est ham@@ burger free !
theat@@ res he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; since March . &quot;
although here almost 2000 people are sc@@ anned in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly ri@@ pped Stev@@ ens returns to intimacy and for folk .
without adding a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; out of the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you could throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to a en@@ core , Stev@@ ens book@@ able , plays a few older songs and tends to finally der@@ ive from tos@@ sing appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the presentation of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has expected his debut in the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister with tensions .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut in the presentation of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to mid@@ day the first of its six forward @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be checked and by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary testing for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as it comes after his appointment as member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at the Tu@@ c @-@ annual convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National Farm@@ hy@@ mn opened to a memorial service to the 7@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory puts in the newspapers in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the S@@ um England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party candidate to sing the National Guard , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leaders , and they were appointed to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth party had originally supported him as a guide .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also within Labour &quot; for@@ kli@@ fts &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pronoun@@ cements on the European Union &apos;s position and limiting their winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c @-@ conference , that Labour Party changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow , and R@@ ent ministers said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to limit the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , who has since David Cameron in the last decade to face the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour president , who promised a different policy support , says that he has given us &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the reflection of the Prime Minister is too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confront@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ ps associated with resistance ho@@ oks and has made it to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Juan , the shadow of economics and minister he is represented , if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea to conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the shelter . I talked about the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often linked with the reflection of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he sp@@ ans that he failed .
since they had been broadcast first in 1990 on TV , the question@@ ers of the Prime Minister as the leader of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliamentary report , has argu@@ ed , she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and has made extensive reforms .

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches ground @-@ standing campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - En@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ als in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Boden@@ stan@@ tive campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has been preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarket its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board with brands like ice manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop owners , which sell tickets to the South Australian Football @-@ liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be out further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ alers for food , alcohol and devices carries its annual investors strategy .
es is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop ju@@ ices and generate higher profits as a met@@ aph@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ oral provincial and Ig@@ A retailers come across a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di will take away five percent of the food market in these two states , and all the available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million revenues per year and Met@@ cash might lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up to 25 office in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million US $ and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts of met@@ ex &apos;s high over@@ heads could cost , met@@ to cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ to loose market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A means is the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes about 3.8 per cent in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in the year 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to react publicly to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a manager of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and income from met@@ cas@@ hing food and food trading , which has been taken by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects its operative debt reduction in sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ ale is hon@@ ors , however , more than 150 million $ , to sell sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ ing &apos;s grand@@ son Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prize @-@ custom@@ iz@@ ations and charging programs to lie ahead and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to winning growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ ka deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and earned his praise as criticism of his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; special k@@ s &quot; was often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying session in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was separated twice through the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison would have to beat together with Har@@ rison , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was most recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ acket , after a runner has failed an potential US Open victory against Richard Gas@@ quet , C@@ k@@ akis of He@@ aly was defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in competition with Sam Groth - the second place in the Valley behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ semi @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I get quite enth@@ r@@ ably , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drew into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat , when he lost because of a Kr@@ amp@@ ant in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has changed in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was going to treat a little too severe .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old he works very hard , and he never suits the team and so on , he is still working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also did not consider the decision to take when deciding on Friday , which begins Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y all around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick was very quick to get the Ascension thing and he has made some fl@@ akes errors and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the r@@ amps which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , ex@@ cludes the border , holding refugees back
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all who tried to arrive , illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants are located in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who were flying before violence were fought for an un@@ familiar time in a stri@@ ps on the road between the two control points of the countries and er@@ ected tents , and settled there .
but Fru@@ it@@ ress climb@@ ed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter led to them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ed the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out of protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bian foreign ministers declared it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ ater@@ al damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence on the ung@@ ar@@ c @-@ Ser@@ b border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block with a postpon@@ ement meeting in Brussels and could not arrange joint immigration policy .
the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were sear@@ ched in over Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would pick another 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however did not put his hopes on an initial action between Brussels or his neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , there were more powers on Tuesday in two southern regions to overcome the crisis , so that they could ha@@ st@@ ain roads and asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said the fact that his country also has the construction of a thorn @-@ patient along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having ended a fence at the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ons are at the race track , set up the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant driving force for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most people are seeking better lives and do not have any war @-@ wing that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight of Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaged of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher adhesi@@ on for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government speaker z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still needs to agree with the use of the military or dis@@ agree that is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have been at the border hard to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already tag@@ ged .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , Country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities pay 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come down by damaged the fence , they are now in police vig@@ il@@ ant and will be accused of criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are always able to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also concluded on Tuesday morning two of the seven border trans@@ itions with Serbia , after a train carriage with sp@@ ins @-@ wire to close the borders .
chaos um@@ gave the main border crossing near Ros@@ is@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and put a crowd to meet .
about 20 managed to come up , but thousands have stayed outside .
another group of migrants were block the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until Hungary should travel to Hungary .

Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the Pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet proclaimed , has he comp@@ lied to the President , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the election .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say it too early to say that their opinion is on which candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more ra@@ yed in their choice than that of the other candidates .
Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups since the C@@ BS @-@ News , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton is holding a big edge in women and co@@ cks , but these le@@ aps have reduced .
your support in men has declined significantly , and so here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton advantage with democratic voters in the age of 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and customs are now at the same height .
Clinton has a long lead in the older voters .
in the last month Clinton had a two @-@ dig@@ it jump in the liber@@ als , but Sin@@ another now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the Pre @-@ elections were saying that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some periods and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons are actual supporters mainly from it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters want to say that they should support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ub@@ can voters this about their candidate &apos;s Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ton supporters can be asked in an open question why they want to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time to be a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
it is also supported by Clin@@ tons Sup@@ porting their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and choosing data are also cited .
as the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top .
by clin@@ ton tags say more than half that for making their second choice far ahead .
decide to run bi@@ ds , not for nomin@@ ation of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary clin@@ ton &apos;s lead is increased from different from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate in the best chances to win the choice ; however , this figure is reduced from 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second to this measurement , but the percentage of people who sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important when a candidate is called democratic voters regarding the voting .
similarly as in the last month no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters want to make this election as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates make good results with some key qualities for voters of their party elections .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates best starting at honest@@ y , while clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe in it .
democratic voters of the Pre @-@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic vot@@ er has no opinion of different .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons , Use a personal email address and a server during the term as an out@@ Federal Minister , the majority of the Democratic voters are pleased with their statement on the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated from her .
there are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say their views of Clinton had become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the constitu@@ ent land@@ es@@ far also sees Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump are good notes in leadership .
from the six progressi@@ ves candidates cho@@ oses Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush at the best in honest@@ y .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of it .
the error rate for the sam@@ pling of 3@@ 51 US voters in the pre@@ cip@@ itation amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son backward survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
half of the candidates fall in the new survey , and others will fall dramatically on the two candidates .
Republi@@ can voters support land@@ es@@ far too tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son s@@ ni@@ b at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son met in demo@@ graphic groups well and sur@@ ron@@ ded by Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in the most profound , namely from 10 % support last month on now 2 % .
the former Florida govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % in the third place .
the error stage at the sam@@ pling of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - he lan@@ det at 19 % support in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ si@@ eves for the former N@@ ine ir@@ ur@@ ges , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask a m@@ umps believe in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaigns show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of Br@@ otherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
nearly two years after having a student during a moving ritual of a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ atur@@ ated will be filed against 5 persons .
members of the New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Br@@ otherhood attacks by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duc@@ tory duration in September 2013 , and consumed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police with .
officials spoke , he had been loaded with some connected eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not calling the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ v@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members started to hide u@@ ten@@ si@@ lien and placed the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood basically by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not re @-@ revi@@ ved , and he died on his wo@@ unds the next morning .
after an auto @-@ seventh p@@ our@@ ning , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with des@@ pot@@ ter force injury to head , tor@@ so , and thig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sever@@ ance of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder of the third gr@@ ades for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for crimes and education of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make responsibility for the involved parties but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , we shall also account this accountable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has re@@ voke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a fork cav@@ ity comes , and the house will come into the sp@@ inning , return for bonds and the economy will run into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instructions on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so fier@@ ce that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact multiple variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could notice , however , that all the excitement because of a Zin@@ ser@@ um may be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian Is@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to fear the emotional shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here &apos;s a look at historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ nia can make things for a while .
once the increase comes , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase investments from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study by what is going according to Zin@@ ser@@ mp@@ ings of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been mostly slow@@ ing down in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the Zin@@ del High Level , rather flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then with average yield in the last six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob Doll , leader of business strategy at nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will appear later in the increases cycle and returns the yield with it in order to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ nia , they often support them .
in the current instance the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is being at its lowest point in the position of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , Germany had only twice nominal terms since 1950 twice the nominal of GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.7 per cent , only few that this will last and expect to expect the third quarter according to the results of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; appearances in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken all year into a prec@@ eding of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
whilst many o@@ egen and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , there is the Fut@@ ures trading just a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all increases of increases from 1950 to the present day in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP is taken place and on pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly following the start of recreation in the shadows , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , waiting since the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ at@@ ile since the market decre@@ ases a fork height , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course .
when bonds seem to change the return once the first increase / lo@@ wering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the increasing cycle the bond @-@ cycle fall immediately , the German bank said .
the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates are leading , resulting in return between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ att@@ ening of the curve .
high @-@ delay bonds often bring better income from such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ ti@@ ous to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
does Jones notice that the markets already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income gap is fl@@ atter , l@@ ending , and vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
within the large and whole , businesses producing the greater part of their business operations in the United States , benefit from interest rates , and more attractive products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt are poor d@@ ast@@ ings , as a rising Dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for shares are extremely positive , three months after an initial fork @-@ height , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points at each of the zinc levels in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average each 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most loose , gold man said .
outside the pure share price , consumers will also benefit from the rising sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ parag@@ us could see prizes by higher y@@ ields , even if experts from different opinions are , how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ized the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also urged the BBC Music Awards and said that it im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the voice to the voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading parliamentary membership and raised new pressure on the channel , to prove that he does something that does not do the privacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEPs Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; failed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is no longer different from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; dirty , &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also took the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only in another name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director@@ ate dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education about the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never hear about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , find new music and to give new works on order , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport campa@@ ign@@ ing with fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory Board of Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins were by The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced in special BBC fashion .
he added that he wishes the company &quot; a hit in our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time an entertainment series .
however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or give money of the pay@@ ers for other sub@@ missions formats .
Internet @-@ turnover climb@@ ed in August at the s@@ lower and the Black Friday can be responsible for that
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online @-@ sales reinforced three years ago by using phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the expenditure
for over a decade , the virtual boarding pass , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales goes stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales representative of the Guardian .
he stated that the online sales went up three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the couch .
but now it turns out , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America will be cited as a basis for re@@ ass@@ ass@@ ing revenues .
experts believe that buyers take their purchases in advance of this event , which is taking place on the last Friday in November .
last year &apos;s field , five times the average number of sellers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer @-@ sites dro@@ aked .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer may withdraw because of bar@@ gain , buyer of it could hold shopping .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that a £ 5 expenditure is spent a little over 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases can now be carried out via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of in the mo@@ es in the square .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ftsmen is over
British employ increasingly art@@ is@@ ans , says Veroni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified cra@@ ftsmen from Eastern Europe has a rise in behind
this leads to that 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are aimed at art@@ is@@ ans , will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales face @-@ wide close
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily mail
it is said that British elect its h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ ftsmen , who carry out their work in their homes ,
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush that can deal with walls , they seem to belong to a minority .
for British increasingly employ cra@@ ftsmen to perform their jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new business manager by King@@ fis@@ her who owns the construction sector chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified cra@@ ftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low pre@@ prices are now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shop came up , opening up with art@@ is@@ ans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of 10 purchasing decisions taken in the shop are hit by women .
in the moment l@@ ull with the employees the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that make more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move it stronger towards a balance .
basically , half of our customers from women are over 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles through women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the head of a British at the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index top company , has also embr@@ aced their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .

according to superi@@ ority Adv@@ oc@@ ate Robert Ri@@ ffel in the preliminary examination , the def@@ endants in the years 2006 until 2011 were mon@@ ed by associations , about which they were disp@@ uted in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage caused it with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports activities are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
this fact divided the chairman of the opening ceremony , Jud@@ ge Michaela San@@ in , out of .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the acknowled@@ gement of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence dar claims that the association has been formed at no time an asset .
the sport@@ s@@ aires would have been compens@@ ated and the sport@@ club for whom they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money from his debts - the Passi@@ va beg@@ ru@@ sted in 2001 approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue to un@@ lock the club or close it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told one of the accused , at the Br@@ ot@@ ene National In@@ struc@@ tions of the Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
by all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been making money for our life insurance as security in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association , you have been agreed : you can manage the money , no debt must be made .
furthermore , in pre @-@ speaking financial success , the pay@@ out of the dis@@ eff@@ er@@ ations were made retro@@ spec@@ tive to 1991 .
therefore , one section of the Auf@@ gei@@ ations did not begin until years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been paid on the account .
therefore , they also seemed to be found in the l@@ ump and not detail@@ ing statements , explan@@ atory the former authorities .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us were managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs of the association has not been detailed in detail and asked the jud@@ gement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , it is important for debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of the investigations , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement .
these are appropri@@ ately , as@@ serted the in@@ def@@ endants .
this document was referred to as the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the question@@ ed did not know an answer .
then he said , he did believe that this is the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew anything of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or introduced in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endant was more informed , the functioning of the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why dem@@ ise dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know the creator and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
thereafter , the first accused did not appro@@ ve of this formulation , because the association was never a damage was formed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that you are all of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the functioning he has never taken a pen@@ al content , it is calculated only od@@ ometer and di@@ ets .
an up@@ un@@ cture it has been charged to the association 1,000 Euro per month , the actual effort was however much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not identify the accused .
they have been judged by a single inspection , in which everything had been judged correctly , did not have been reviewed any more .
Kilomet@@ er@@ ak also had the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all pleas@@ ures are made in bar , after that he must drive from his residence international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the consultation of witnesses .

the time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world is observed whenever the U.S. note on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 Econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was last week , that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will do a slightly longer and interest rates on the current state from 0 to 0,25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed turned interest on N@@ ULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may start the zero @-@ level and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel MO@@ st@@ iti@@ vely , director of employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just one small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rust@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to raise , but signs point out that the chances of taking such a step is good .
the decision is said to be announced at 20.00 h ME@@ Z on Thursday
death penalty at the Delta State University leaving Ent@@ schul@@ dig@@ ungs@@ ungen
after the shot and notes of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he k@@ ick@@ ed his pe@@ ach on the day he wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb , a note , to say that he would be &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Do@@ zent for Ge@@ ography and Social Wel@@ ding education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he killed on someone and killed someone .
Lamb said the staff of the staff , that the police officer will send to his home .
he said , &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , but that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police demanded the ru@@ fer to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb there was no explanation for his shots .
as the police received the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notification of Lamb , 45 , the said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could make it rever@@ sible .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb became 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he reported E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , k@@ ills before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen ask him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb sup@@ pos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ is also had a relationship with Schmidt , told authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three relationship &quot; relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have a daughter who is 19 and it was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss their daughter &quot; were absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ is , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , has been met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
the police said , Lamb struck at a certain moment on Monday to say to them , &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , drove his car to the side , flew away into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded in spring 2015 by the Delta State University , a Doc@@ tor@@ ates , like his li@@ vest@@ on to the Univers@@ ities of the University .

Euro@@ truck : Lufthansa builds the Group

the objective of the re @-@ execution is a result of income of about 500 million Euros per year from cost and profits , divided the airline on Wednesday with .
among other things , at Lufthansa , there is no longer a board of management for the passenger .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for months @-@ months due to dou@@ bling Fra@@ ktur with
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double frac@@ ture of his right foot .
while this has led the left margin of foreign minister and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno after the 20 year old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen , before it was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said , &quot; he has double b@@ einf@@ ra@@ zed and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then in Manchester surgery .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then it was fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a physician , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red map and the suspension of a sl@@ ay@@ er .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alized the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ p meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account gives : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
therein : Manchester United ligh@@ tly the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when defeat the PS@@ V
the England Def@@ enders has an added incentive with the European Championships in France to recover from June to next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said , &quot; It is a very limited injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg near as Mexico against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and when you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was going on in another direction , so that it looked as if he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very poor with me . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better ?
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost im@@ pressing .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book chose , the prime minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 scar@@ ed environment @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron speaking in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the stor@@ y@@ line of the book , instead of applying a content track of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the silent city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity to see the girl of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was l@@ elled and the 1991 died , but fully unknown .
as if that still could not be suspic@@ i@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron is in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ Films that is being presented on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he seems to be a prag@@ mat@@ ous father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . here list@@ ens an un@@ named Once , such as the local environment by the nam@@ es@@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ier being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; des@@ ol@@ ate .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in succ@@ ession .
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come by Camer@@ ons &apos;s vote office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
travelling to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one has selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , there is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series by not on my card .
I would not ex@@ clude an aw@@ kward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks , may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not bear the cars of 2012 , only a adol@@ es@@ cent positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ vies Ali is being built as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an in@@ known size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
material @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th st@@ alls from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as being his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented on results .
there was no question mark on Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and that led to nomin@@ ation , as - and I said this - players have their own best selection .
long ago , you would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when he will hopefully see more lo@@ ops for Yor@@ k@@ shire there will come another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even though he did not bring such good performances and that was not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test stroke gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Bar@@ ton nine got .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and black@@ outs .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England launched first Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean , but in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ es comes in and he is a stroke that I put up high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he att@@ une 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very close to us .
it must maintain at least the same chances as the before him , but it depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ vies besides C@@ ook , indic@@ ating what an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler can bring and four tran@@ icks would be received , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not strike there , and these left @-@ handed has already demonstrated that he is a devil @-@ shot by cri@@ cket players .
Mozart has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he made a hundred boun@@ ces immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see themselves their statistics on an average of 31 with the r@@ ack@@ ets and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no huge number of backup sp@@ ans that rise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England has made a few clever additions to the co@@ aches .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ an , the Batt@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test@@ games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices in the locker room will bring fresh air even if the messages are in line with the previous mess@@ enger .
col@@ lage team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ performers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made light heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain from the EU ) could win an allowance , if the economy up to 2017 in a Fl@@ os@@ er device
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ folded new ver@@ sion@@ ed strategy to keep the UK in the EU , will face any deeper trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Chief of Labour or the Tu@@ c who suffered violent implications for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said some member states , so deeply rooted in different crises as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself set an agenda with seg@@ reg@@ ated conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing c@@ anti@@ ations which they usually do not wish to fill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brigh@@ ton , the tu@@ c decided on their annual general meeting , that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb@@ ed to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants a looking outside Great Britain in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass wishes us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows us that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for it , as it is bad for them , as it has been done for the exagger@@ ation such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a le@@ ft@@ ist .
it &apos;s hard to present themselves that they should get a leg to help the self @-@ British control whose energy should be utilized more efficiently , Scotland &apos;s leaving the UK to prevent something they didn &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tendencies have .
therefore , possibly do not plan some such ministers even ab@@ usi@@ ve any helpful comment , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Great Britain &apos;s referendum 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the beginning of the re @-@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press , as they were during the Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational referendum , but did not have the entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
you can remember to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made themselves a name as an &quot; EU comm@@ ing ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ er years .
with all his cra@@ zin@@ ess knew Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sh@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ish exter@@ min@@ ions and the p@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ dies , which have the majority of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about it , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you are better ban@@ anas spread to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , mil@@ king band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , when he dism@@ issed himself as the speech of the EU , since Bl@@ air was rejected the principle over the in@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened to him a back@@ doors .
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n gave me on the back on Monday to Westminster - I told him there was no more time for me to do for me - seems to have no more time for me to repeat Kin@@ ki@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat a mistake at that time and today .
it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC couch he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position for Europe - I simply put it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ent tendency and the wil@@ der vessels of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism , everyone can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no gas@@ oline &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week told me to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ ver@@ end John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father committed himself to his efforts , for@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going to far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , to be &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n@@ n expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , neither what J@@ C said his fellow @-@ affili@@ ation , and MPs , according to all reports on her cl@@ ause .
whatever the tou@@ ching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image is im@@ part of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News discipline in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it &apos;s right , Cameron does not give freedom card for Europe that allowed him to keep lab@@ ours support in the speech resolution for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks of course .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for the EU membership - in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs economy , their anti @-@ capitalist f@@ law - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ presi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ ion of the small f@@ are@@ well is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ low@@ ly convinced that Y@@ C does not start a campaign to ex@@ ert - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to seek , in particular to find a sense of their supervis@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin turn out political capital - they have also mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost of the T@@ ory government at power , which I was remin@@ is@@ cent of something at the start of the Monday by the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise reports from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by considering the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
p@@ he published the &quot; primary report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the load of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a director in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy basis &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ rav@@ , Professor for Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expect that &quot; the current issue is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ subject criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead to their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ ous products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ens said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director is previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Factory ( BA@@ T ) for independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports prior to the Tab@@ ak@@ tor Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but include multiple known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also indicate a branch financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco headed by p@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lowing evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ens said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes has been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that claims by BM@@ J was previously responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ er dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to this are small , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term effects to study .
p@@ he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what does not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year .
by clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ en@@ ders , says former manager of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ man &apos;s and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programmes that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are publicly known as legal programs which are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in harsh controversial legal window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Pro@@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which were also un@@ ambig@@ uous by not sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you wish to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I consider medium @-@ long or long term , you should do his production at least for programs , others do not do or put them on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve a possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous ; it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why it is a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed even without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly either both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give her right arm for it .
I would like to see how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , a busin@@ ess@@ men for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC signs to blame for evalu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts made by the BBC will give again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they perform rather the audience , and they can argue if they are going to their own sacred missions to justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ circular fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of window , in which no one she ever wanted to see .
to the spar@@ kling fee said Johnson said to the board : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can obtain the best value .
of course , you all think that you receive a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people that &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC can review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to form and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC production would now be formally classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV output and 0,1 % in the radio - and it should be addressed to the publicly official TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada for example , to inform and enter@@ tain this . &quot;
to question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown and with the commercial Sen@@ ders alliances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; may control bra@@ in@@ cells by b@@ aff@@ le cells
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change direction at the moment in which it is radi@@ ated with Klang@@ impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ ached the wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified crops , which can be controlled by phr@@ ases of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which it with sound impul@@ ses , which have been heard for human hearing too high frequencies , in order to be pun@@ ished .
the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that are responding to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of anti @-@ brain , an invasive procedure which gives electric impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fi@@ di@@ ver usually do not respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und but Chal@@ as@@ ani notes that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und effects affect the structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ inder and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
sound waves carry the opening of these I@@ onian channels and activate the cells that are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und n@@ emat@@ o@@ des , altered chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ents carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he turns ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ blocks , and transfer into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on eur@@ on@@ ism .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn and switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light that must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired job in the brain , the low @-@ frequency ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und tissue may occur and thus can be sent in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the challenged human neur@@ ons temporarily to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I started as self @-@ se@@ eded 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense Sm@@ ile of those I have become anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ win@@ ded complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the draw in student dormit@@ ories varies from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to sch@@ wat@@ t : people tell , where thou come from wherever you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest , neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were in fire and that fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night spaces and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people get dressed and decor@@ ating their under@@ wear .
in this way , do not remember to catch the university with a relationship
Int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted gets a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , yet many students inhab@@ it a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ umm@@ el culture , which can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture will allow you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship further , but you have to go away to get the energy back for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a var@@ it@@ ate is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it an SMS instead .
A@@ prop@@ os ank@@ lets : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ determined door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship re@@ marked by b@@ aking .
as you begin the university at the peak of back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ister is to imagine the doors of people , in order to imagine with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years , welcome in the neighborhood . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicacies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally , it depends if you are a decent B@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat lead to people as@@ le@@ ep up having as@@ le@@ ep .
to ste@@ al food is a common crimes in student dormit@@ ories .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check the with the breast@@ owner .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone goes off your things , the annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to make it weigh@@ ed as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise which stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to men that are sitting in the glass building .
a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether they gave them something , Drum and bass spr@@ int , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
she re@@ acted to even listen to older music .
when they finally heard at 5 am , she allowed her neighbors to sleep even two hours before they left their own music , shut her door shut down and settled at her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be acci@@ dental into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
contr@@ ari@@ wise , it would not be deeply embarrassing for you to keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future married to get to her again , and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how to bring all common friends to them ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to speak a bit of reason to your base .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment in which you notice that somebody has its keys in his not shared rooms , the border is between a cl@@ ot and har@@ as@@ sment , as it seems .
a good stretch is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
healing by install@@ ments a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but have never ch@@ ew the rooms with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close their door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you can then free@@ zer into free@@ zer - but give your poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice fixed .
town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ in@@ ers , t@@ ing@@ th@@ ers
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ Frank@@ fort town@@ houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing spaces , but also the only professional mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how you can also build it even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pressing for the market @-@ market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or trainers has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
given the refugee current , we need adequate living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ day fri@@ ction @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a man @-@ house needs least number of space .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
that is different if one blocks the people in living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three dwell@@ ings for each four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is located at 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took place .
this is reasonable .
have the rules for their plans a bit more complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : design @-@ right I used my project to be correct .
especially complicated makes it always the risk of d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ema special design and the slot rules .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ posed who creates in a realm of three apartments , needs at least three places .
only in the cities is lacking in place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents who responded to their fri@@ ction @-@ project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there have been what have been thrown to me , luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but tigh@@ ten you not the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true it is true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but has been built with luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also the normal human beings need .
not only refugees , but also the only professional mother or the righteous .
I am showing how you can develop even cheap and well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the activation app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allgem@@ ein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install the install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered problems after the installation because they receive a error message which decides the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software upgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so by using the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool using apps and then install them again as soon as the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a cargo device , so that the battery is loaded .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ markt Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft covered themselves under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new approach to Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg .
besides consulting we can also take part in courses .
the social foundation makes it up from the mountain to the city center .
closer to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new quar@@ tered office .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , received immediately sen@@ iors and advice on information about how to care health insurance or services in nursing and nursing homes .
for years , we have been firmly established with our out@@ patient care service that often aff@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant should be left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not rarely taken many achievements of the masses , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new households in Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , which is responsible as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the nur@@ sery and the ambul@@ ant service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro however also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
this was taken into the boat by the Sal@@ u@@ dis .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault Pre@@ vention , memory training , or physi@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic treatment .
the offers of the Sen@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and Reh@@ a .
&quot; the senior Centre for assistance and care , &quot; commented Heike R@@ ie@@ del , manager of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new neighbour@@ hoods in the city center are seeing both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
that is because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the different parts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) joined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , devoted to the quot@@ ation office at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able ming@@ ling . &quot;
with that , the social foundation makes a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days between 10 am and 12 o &apos;clock .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practices in Fel@@ resi@@ ausen , and invest@@ s 310@@ 000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ic@@ in Uta S@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside physicians - As@@ endorf on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller is taking charge of the practice of Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor is still on the coming months with a half point .
after a radical phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 again , until then he will invest 310@@ 000 Euros at the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met who at present completed their practice education at the dener hospital and will also end up into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when that was where I was simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Couple , Müller @-@ liked the idea , in future in As@@ endorf that has its own practice .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he can see his own chief soon .
and thus one was agreed that the gar@@ bage dump the house with the practice .
living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dium in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
at the moment he has been a veter@@ inary surgeon in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed to the executive staff in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen was employed as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife has specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to the Gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ ators .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the re@@ modeling the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ investigations as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ GS and need an intercom room .
furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how pro@@ ud@@ ly and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ communities Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients are according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter in the practice field , in the North @-@ German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home office .
a positive side @-@ effects of the practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains in the Ur@@ sel Field in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found she would have gone .
who is visiting gar@@ ter &apos;s speech , moreover , continues to be particularly familiar to familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleans@@ ing of cleans@@ ing from the field .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medic@@ s have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sm@@ ausen was sm@@ elled .
a little sad@@ ness feel after the long time .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is comple@@ mented by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always been pressed for gardening , now this could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will also be up@@ loaded on our border &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Inter@@ minist@@ erial Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border always remain er@@ ect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before it was clear that everyone who wants to commit a asylum statement , that can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia er@@ cis@@ ed &quot; Kor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously predicted that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees would be established .
in the very way it looked at the entrance of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ pe in Lai@@ bach . however , this is not the case .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
on the border with Croatia there is already strong control over the border of the Schengen period .
as the Minister said , Slovenia has thus not im@@ pose its borders for refugees but not wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr. Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees were already trying to travel in the night hours to Tuesday , in East usa , at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to leave to the registration .
the Croatian police could take it in the nearby dimensions of power .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also lif@@ egu@@ ards and the Red Cross were already in operation .
in the coming days will host his country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , the buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border that had so far been diver@@ ted to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade refers , however , that it is whether people need to pursue certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media outlets in the morning we report a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d , during the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been around the entire night of the city &apos;s approximately 500 kilometers distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police have told us that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually be a predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat more west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options on the border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was preparing for the fall of a strong refu@@ ge of refugees appropriate plans for possible ref@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details stated he did not , but pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners present a good witness to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ish side stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ um for about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media they would have spent the past night at the Border Cros@@ sing Hor@@ g@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions of Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees leave now to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
Ser@@ bian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm two week at a local market in Hor@@ g@@ os : he kept the debates about Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ck of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at present to deal with very high refugee numbers .
one could not say if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
auxili@@ ary rates from migrants to - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
however , private Hungarian refugee centres have already begun to spread the refugees maps on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian country still not vac@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ e@@ pers were sent to the border region .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ Result Mi@@ xed , Fin@@ anz @-@ Aussichten for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the final quarter , and the delivery gig ensures his winn@@ ings on a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ at@@ oning service .
the company also said that she is planning to visit about 5@@ 5,000 seasons for the holiday .
at that time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the Company would like to set 5@@ 0,000 lit@@ ers for the holiday period .
the share fell on 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , ending 20 cent less than in previous pre@@ diction .
Analy@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 ₣
the lower prospect comes in spite of the price increases , average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite the higher conditions for soil transfer of heavy and big packages that will be charged from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company said that it is estimated that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher recei@@ pts and for growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; sound y@@ ields only to take into account the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than the ri@@ vals U@@ PS , that is planning , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 per cent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share spent on memories $ per share , just under the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ones Investment Research question@@ ed anal@@ ysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks be@@ viewed anal@@ ysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has resulted in a decline in the international pri@@ or@@ it@@ ec disp@@ atch in recent years which took sales in his unit Express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express group bran@@ ded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result due to higher labour power in the freight @-@ business declined .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they joined together with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ato spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table meeting to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the lad@@ der .
Dro@@ h@@ end over them at an end to the one , two @-@ store@@ yed seat squ@@ als is located a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is remember@@ ing that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ line order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices down here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a draw@@ back third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate would be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to it . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the immediate short term interest rate by the close to zero short term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets , which already make @-@ sigh@@ ted F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives , these vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for Bundes@@ bonds - and be it even just a quarter percent@@ point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important of what they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ au &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate is not to increase , the increased security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself on the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently question@@ ed by Bloomberg have predicted that week these week are predicted .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless that Str@@ at@@ investigate the blow to mit@@ ig@@ ate , by promising that another increase is far removed .
on Tuesday j@@ umped winner of the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage is worth 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets into panic , so that they do not get panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a Zin@@ ser@@ um would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate in@@ security about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percent@@ ages this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the Mongo@@ lian conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ing down , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate sank on 5.@@ 1 % last month , the min for over seven years and near the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
Pay@@ ments have shown a sign of recovery .
and although inflation ran continuously under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can get higher interest rates and takes them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world coinci@@ ded with the end of the last month , after China had been upgraded to its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Sh@@ aver@@ ary was worth more than 16 % below its peak , than investors were feared that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would become the global growth of these th@@ rot@@ tles .
the market has recovered over this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation and when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy did not occur during the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low said at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. group .
now he predicted that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what will be the implications for the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global health of the world economy is one of the main factors of F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could have their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; narrow , &quot; ext@@ ingu@@ ished Tur@@ b@@ ulation around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , from the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in another place , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for our asset management company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , commented that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ pres@@ sive actions on financial market movements , which appear with apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , un@@ anim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a Zin@@ ser@@ hei@@ ment , committed decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to alle@@ vi@@ ate its benchmark results in three sessions &quot; despite side @-@ recogni@@ zable implications for growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives pulled this cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England .
the most recent turbul@@ ence are not near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly wants not to be in the situation where they are afraid of a prec@@ arious position , because markets s@@ exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still does not contain double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe für Refu@@ ge@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees arrive in Germany in these days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are welcome to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with the body and a soul teacher .
even with their 74 lungs they are still taught .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
naturally teaching is quite different from being at the right school .
Brasi@@ li@@ ens p@@ ä@@ di@@ atric society Rio Grande supports food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to educate women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of paintings of babies , who are interested in br@@ ack@@ ets that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
mother &apos;s milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , to give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher calories are not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation to should be made .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet therefore pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exemp@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the municipal @-@ ried amber approved the construction site for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
plant@@ ations for the long ers@@ eh@@ elled turn@@ hall@@ way in the amber area are taking step by step forward : in the recent council meeting was the un@@ worked construction site without great discussions .
before , the panel had decided among others a request for a structural legal &quot; exception , &quot; accepted &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the exception of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form relating to the construction construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ gradu@@ ated first and attic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the planned use of the umbrella area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why we get a wonderfully large southern end , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again rose to the umbrella , which should be pre @-@ written for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to the pit@@ falls does not apply &quot; exceptions - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der community is usually cru@@ ci@@ fied with anti @-@ liber@@ ities .
the turn@@ hall@@ way is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we are thus creating a preced@@ ent , &quot; thus St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the Sports Center is a common project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of some 2.3 million euros is calculated .
grants is expected by the training and long@@ itude promotion .
in the next proc@@ ed@@ ural stage , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters is now submitted to the Council for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ght@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ j@@ berg hospital is intended to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the medical director of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ght@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this striking plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the Land@@ r@@ ens@@ in Andrea Jeh@@ chner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the heads of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the ch@@ ased on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action , all of the barely 50 employees would be working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ erk@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority shall be revers@@ ed with fishermen and the continued internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees that can not be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about their plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the manager of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , and now has changed to a private practice in the direct vicinity of the hospital .
in the question of who the follow @-@ up was born , according to Jeh@@ chner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; in the game , who explained to take charge of 1 October the management and to take with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this will result in each case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and wi@@ dening of the quot@@ ation in the field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardiovascular and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
over the next two years , fishermen leave with his team when the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will agree to each other houses , until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ enheim , which has more than 35 beds to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ j@@ berg after almost 140 years .
previously , the county has planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing reconstruction is completed at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ens@@ in Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß , which is also chairman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , alas , which house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ apping , in future shall be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner was not able to say , there are several reflec@@ tions .
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a diary @-@ based housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better we could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Fischer on the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mov@@ ing at the Le@@ ch , who were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the home in which fishermen has been working as chief doctor for over 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure over the last decades , such as surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the palms of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are demanded today ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favour@@ ites , occasion for hand@@ over .
in the last season the bath at B@@ HC participated at the B@@ HC and took some goo@@ dies there .
Jag@@ ie@@ fall with two last near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ kt@@ or@@ ists are badly inju@@ red during their ma@@ is@@ ern@@ te on Tuesday afternoon through shots .
during the Aber@@ n@@ ome on a ma@@ is@@ feld at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ sberg Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , like the police .
after a qu@@ eue a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear .
the police force can be determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence @-@ breaking
a Tat@@ dil@@ ome@@ ch has led the police on Lei@@ che for Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
the trial was killed by the 20 @-@ year @-@ old people killed and their body was throwing into a channel in rock@@ enhausen .
one since Saturday missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a violence broke down .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enhausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ution and police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ a@@ edic , one is also regarded at the service evening , 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which de@@ ed the indication of the letter and the investig@@ ator has led to the discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing in the Sunday morning after she didn &apos;t come home at the eve after a visit of a autumn in Rock@@ enhausen .
when searching for the young lady , the investig@@ ators first took on personal objects of the victim .
when question@@ ings in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing occurred eventually a Tat@@ a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ in@@ arian offen@@ ders led the police into a channel in rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse has been found .
the rep@@ ent@@ ment issued the authorities in the police killed , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies were put into the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be demonstrated on Wednesday to the Chief tri@@ ck@@ le , the investig@@ ators put him Tot@@ us to the burden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dis@@ closing of the approaches of circumstances should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warned about resi@@ dences
the situation on the German market market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a pay@@ able lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing structure is facing up to a challenge .
the distribution struggles at the German residential market have long ago started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the tense and unemployed people from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already paved in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens in order to pay the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Soci@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
thus there are 14@@ 0,000 flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , as an asylum seek@@ ers in a former accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many then come across the dormit@@ ory market and go into the long sn@@ akes ahead of the rental apartments .
according to the Statist@@ ical Bundes@@ amt stayed in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent .
the negative development of the residential area , however , lies not only on the rising of the concentration camps .
this study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany moves a bed deficit from year to year larger from year to year .
currently in the metro@@ politan areas already approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many of the working people stayed therefore in large @-@ cities cou@@ plings in tram rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ wit@@ ched for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per head has dropped again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the coalition of social housing is propos@@ ing a new start .
in doing so , new incentives will boost the social housing structure .
so could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the under@@ tre@@ ft tax and the property tax for funded apartments are exposed .
in addition , the alliance has been attractive tax @-@ free de@@ preci@@ ation .
the Förder@@ programm for Refu@@ ge@@ es at the State Bank K@@ f@@ W , comes from cities and villages already now .
a good week after starting was launched in the evening with 184 million euros during the evening , with 184 million euros at the disposal .
now the project could even be sto@@ cked .
refugees have free nest : Croatia and Slovenia create cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no transit , there more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ dles .
dangerous is the route nevertheless .
Croatia wants to assure the neighbouring country of Slovenia on setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the slo@@ ven@@ ian interior , and when it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ Land of Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dow@@ ning of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the borders at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which played in force on the same day , make the decent home procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the Ser@@ bian border to EU neighbouring country in the morning .
the majority of media were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival she would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
during the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees were not located on Gren@@ ad@@ ä@@ une .
therefore , the border stri@@ ps other dangers : there are sharp min@@ ors from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ en@@ räum@@ er are aiming to create a secure passage .
after Hungary , after the closing of the border , there are almost no refugees .
on Tuesday the police were 36@@ 6 connected people .
just before the deadline on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws touches the exit and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as pen@@ ny .
thus in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , this is therefore 35 a criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned thre@@ aten adhesi@@ on for up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to data from the immigration authority , on Tuesday they have assumed a total of 94 kinder@@ garten on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with young children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees dro@@ wned .
practically , however , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after un@@ hung@@ arian , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to deal with it .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , the tens of thousands of people left at the road .
Sper@@ or@@ gitter were dis@@ assembled and one of the entrance hall in the border town was rebuilt .
as the goal of this transformation , nobody wanted to express themselves .
Austria is reaching only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants remained in the country but still in the country .
in Salzburg there are approximately 1400 people waiting for travel to Germany .
the move from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of German authorities .
in free@@ wheel , smaller groups of refugees met a regular basis .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the border
&quot; we were very busy after the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the flood@@ ing , when suddenly ten people were standing by stran@@ gers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said Wern@@ stein Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria because of the refugee stream , for them in Wern@@ stein , was the Stad@@ ler which immediately offered his help and the bases that were ch@@ apped together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we have the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once ast@@ ro@@ ast@@ ed , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages .
we have said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow him to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro to the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this makes us very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening , during the Saturday evening , on Sundays in Wels was converted from a ICE into a regional move towards Pass@@ au to try again after the short @-@ term pro@@ clam@@ ation that the road to Germany was dis@@ continued but still trying to try the border .
the regional train was placed at the Inn in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the brid@@ ging association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday included a two @-@ brid@@ led sport@@ y - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other tongues to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , at the disposal of the establishment of structures , human@@ eness , our German Chancellor , has officially opened , and publicly presented the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ lin of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing cha@@ otic states now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try must find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited , and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge facing the sustained refugee currents and the nearby winter , in order to produce decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater than maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35.@@ 000 hi@@ ber@@ stur@@ dy Qu@@ arti@@ ers
Konrad has full power to deal with the refugee movement .
Christian Konrad is used to be his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ kers to set up qu@@ arti@@ ers for the thousand refugees .
finally , the chaos in the first @-@ centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria was without great hosts , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; Master power . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interior ministers spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cro@@ ach@@ ful situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 lod@@ g@@ ings in the h@@ ep@@ y year .
to fulfil the number , in the next few weeks , more than 35,@@ 000 accommodations are found - 20,000 , the countries are available , 15,@@ 000 the covenant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it be more refugees , we can make it happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted discussions with the provincial merch@@ ants .
these could have promised to it , even for the coming refugees qu@@ lod@@ g@@ ings .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
in the morning there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ en@@ born , it is said to explain how the church will help .
great expectations will be given asylum coordin@@ ator also into the OR@@ F action as we are . &quot;
the Platform can offer private people un@@ complicated accommodation .
moreover , one hopes to see at hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emer@@ gen@@ cies it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must have a certain amount of to@@ wel @-@ holders or size of the sky@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be valid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , as opposed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , he was hu@@ gely successful with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you do not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
belief is his most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er does not cause any costs , as they said themselves .
your employees want to raise it on three to four .
so far the search was still not successful .
finally , he wanted to place a container at the square Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
yet , there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because one can under@@ estimated the people affected by these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in case of emergency , further sites are expected to be tested for their exchange .
the President of the chief reflects the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ unds are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an extended contact with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) conducted further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer reas@@ sured to me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further voy@@ age of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special extracts with refugees to Germany will be there no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the sear@@ chers would have brought to Germany with regular intervals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger took a stronger solidarity in the refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria again lead to its borders , is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action taken by the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director@@ ate of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the fields of technology .
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
it can imagine , to invest in the start @-@ up firms of the New ship@@ yard and later also to be qui@@ valent .
from the beginning of the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1,7 million euros invested by S &amp; T to invest EUR 3.3 million from Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is characterized by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent do not give it to requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Ark@@ ade
the new Shop is the fur@@ la hand@@ bags at the heart of the new shop .
in actual fact , Jutta wanted to bro@@ w a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ dic@@ ress of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade short@@ cut : after all , it has got its rise in form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which they sold among other po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and threads of different manufacturers , now turns everything to have d@@ resses hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
it was already rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ laid whether I want to open a shop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the Fur@@ la @-@ producers that are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a private site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the sub@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful in the Groß@@ raum Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has himself Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ interest has been ran@@ ked wide from her mother to the cradle .
thr@@ ust the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman laid out in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into ench@@ ant@@ ment , the specialist lady can &apos;t answer my last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is being upgraded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose inhabitants are called an@@ am@@ pler .
this property also associated with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fication .
whether it expresses foreign policy , journalists aud@@ de or knowledge g@@ ass@@ ing in international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the US presidential office would be strongly led to the election campaign .
and das@@ hed well with them .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate is come down .
the New Yorker with the bo@@ oming fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ vers in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related via -@@ forty corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the electoral setting .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned out a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers have over his aim to become a mighty man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed at their K@@ all@@ stadt kind too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native c@@ enter@@ tain@@ er has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ers made , to which next to Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump who is not known for dest@@ in@@ arity , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also said to word - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he did not have it there .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ly the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; a big @-@ la@@ zy &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the Nickname &quot; name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in stron@@ gh@@ olds , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather had hi@@ ked out and opened in the US a local restaurant for gol@@ d@@ visits .
Grund@@ stein of the estate corporation were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from wearing : your desire to return to the country for a long time , failed in the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was then belonged .
he did not record hem@@ p because he once was h@@ ew@@ ed without a permit , had explained the director of the Institute for C@@ ables History and People &apos;s unde , Roland Paul , to the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a limit wall to det@@ sc@@ out illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ tert , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote kin@@ dre@@ ad ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a n@@ atives tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ egro@@ wer in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ setting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ers in Veronika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ ger K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit to the church organ came , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald don &apos;t imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make it better if he did not win the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when those who had the s@@ add@@ on at the time of his grandfather in the US as he would , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film , viewed for Tr@@ ump for long , have 12 000 grand@@ children , even in the USA awak@@ ens the interest .

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Sal@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recent lost father , which closes , with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could bring a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and suggested slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven saw mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new tri@@ via show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 am to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res Hot @-@ seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .

the last three are in line : Bachelor &apos;s Sam wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
how to be secret ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have kno@@ w@@ ingly obvious who the Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam wood in The Bachelor &apos;s finally , was wr@@ apped in the biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left girl will certainly not give cost if they have received the one that has received the last rose .
but when we use Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may possibly have failed to indicate who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the finals on Thursday sealed
all three women have left out in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude than reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could your answers to the game b@@ ber be won , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki , both quickly - except itself - Mack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one simple relationship from day one to another .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and re@@ marked the energies that I felt quite compatible , and I thought that it was quite compatible in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah starts with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with one another .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes they and Sam wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her perspective , Mack@@ ay said that the house@@ wife did last week her clearly that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now looking forward to it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the desired girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent to en@@ quires after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost a ger@@ angel like it was the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ converter to his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave him the next opportunity to a bl@@ unt return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of putting his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula boo@@ sted Hay@@ ne also publicly available in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ pped him to forget his negoti@@ ated mu@@ zzle , and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne Pat@@ ts at a P@@ unt which was restored in the first @-@ quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers that he had hop@@ ed for his NF@@ L de@@ position .
Hay@@ ne announced after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine worse start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; this was a thing that appears now , you just takes care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne discovered the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ üt then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .

&quot; otherwise we will get ver@@ if@@ ying in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ er leaves to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Comm@@ une .
actually were quite different main topics .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum is conf@@ isc@@ ated , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria , as it was in the former Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it does not go further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wast@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the free vot@@ er as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also called for more personnel for the administration , which are responsible for asylum authority : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but this is not far enough .

festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jumps
after a long distances , the German stock market has closed down @-@ wide distances , tr@@ amo@@ red and nervous trade on the inside .
only in the afternoon the US @-@ stock exchange for a clear direction holding the D@@ ax was ultimately shaped by the D@@ ax to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points to the top .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium sized values were awarded in 15 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ el@@ astic Tec@@ DA@@ X rose by 9 percent to 17@@ 36,@@ 69 points .

in the USA the D@@ ow Jones Jones index was last about 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets right up to the interest of interest in the US and also to the large exp@@ ir@@ ation to the dead@@ lines on this Friday at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the atomic change has led the shares of R@@ WE , by the meantime , pushed onto a record deep and left deep traces in eon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing the German energy companies may have 30 billion euros of retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government denied the figures listed in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy buildings subsequently recovered some , but ultimately still herbal per cent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .

Google starts re@@ doubled donations in order to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling t @-@ driven campaign that will help the thousands of refugees to help the thousands of refugees trying to over@@ run the European nations as they fled from the war , and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the don@@ or call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager the announcement made , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who has escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey were many dark railway and buses , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew out , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately seek help .
the donations go to four charitable organisations responsible for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally active donations has declined to a value of 5.5 million on google.com .

for easily over@@ sized di@@ ab@@ etics may be beneficial effects .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people living with diabetes in weight surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death information need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
you will reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years there have been proven adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which has accum@@ ulated in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach @-@ speci@@ ation - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who subjected itself to this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed at those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who subjected itself to a surgical procedure , dis@@ solved in 36 % the diabetes condition completely and at 28 % partially .
in terms of diabetes , diabetes also solved only one per cent and in part with only two percent in diabetes .
in addition , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels by hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar values over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery the average ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved her@@ al@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased by not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ ably average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more likely a complete exit of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit from surgery to five years , there are evidence from a study he@@ ed people in Sweden that leads surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was with@@ ett@@ led people who under@@ went about an obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study had no benefit for survival during surgery patients said Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone imp@@ lied that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they &apos;ve accum@@ ulated this genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story takes place at H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
Europe cannot take in all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East still lie .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics research .
in the given circumstances , he called for the interests of humanity to be placed against the interests of each nations or even contin@@ ence .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama was praised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in managing the crisis , he empha@@ sized that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ity in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction from the US moved a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11th , I have expressed my ac@@ ur@@ p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from taking hand inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ic@@ ation centers in the United States report about nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , which can@@ es strongly anti @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , wins the cases of revenues of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years old , the tox@@ ic@@ ation centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately you enter a percentage of them going up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE on social media .
watch videos on YouTube , such as adolesc@@ ents dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have sup@@ pos@@ edly mixed by dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic oral water to be a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be caught by attractive smells of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ ected .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ ling , grapes and orange pe@@ ers , which are very pleas@@ ing for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in children @-@ children , few sy@@ ringe can lead to alcohol @-@ po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ hin in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let m@@ ck whis@@ ky to stand around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from the stra@@ wberry @-@ inf@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school was taken into an emergency service .
their blood @-@ alcoholic Con@@ centr@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that was supposed to be considered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Sy@@ ch@@ ey , a nur@@ se doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she came up .
doctors over@@ gu@@ arded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease in signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by alcohol and mind her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , to use non @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after the end of hand san@@ iti@@ zer , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suppose that the product has been meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol which was noted as a substance .
in January , three students from the fourth class in the State of New York , to det@@ ox@@ ify their &quot; teacher &quot; teachers , where they submitted anti@@ bacterial products relating to the class@@ rooms , &quot; says it a police report .

it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the United States , and there are often more applic@@ ants available as seats available , will take place a ma@@ ke@@ eper lot@@ tery , to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media fields from 12 to five .
who is chosen , who will observe it emotional .
I cannot do that .
I will sit with Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps to stem my own relationship in the course of the months with tel@@ eph@@ ones and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma calls me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants and you get access .
I agree with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have put better artic@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong with what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he didn &apos;t tell me what I wrote to write and I would not do it if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ tile of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a deadly death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can contact for this .
what you will get of me is what it means to die for a man &apos;s unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police @-@ hunt @-@ gro@@ unded , out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he reason@@ ed the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Perth , the police were un@@ successful , when he was in sil@@ ky and sw@@ amp@@ y water was just a few meters from a police dock , tried to persu@@ ade him &quot; gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale brought out on Tuesday to a peaceful break @-@ up incident in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , these to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the waters and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , C@@ ome and hol &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too delighted to make his uniform @-@ form , so he turned aside a reliable tactics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Championships @-@ soccer player Ben Cous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in the year of 2006 cous@@ ins of his car was driving into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards finished , ex@@ ert him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport .
Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards from racing Victoria today tried to install and dro@@ pping a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables past year , to immediately end the race .
he went on the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ r@@ ite division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult circumstances , when it was for the positive cob@@ alt cru@@ d@@ dress at Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying presentation and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have long forgotten to it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there are further .
sometimes you have to react ; and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to walk about this job and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be more co@@ aches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before had Moo@@ dy replaced the bom@@ b into an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integ@@ r@@ ite Department has tried to create his stable frame .
&quot; from eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables for giving information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they clearly believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they attempt to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , ehem . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ der , am@@ acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L were aware of the time and are still alive today .
should I bring that to the opinion that it is personally ?
did follow Route L and maybe people outside of co@@ aches are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and come to me , and I have no doubt that what I say to it now lets me think about it now .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the co@@ aches have established themselves with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could say &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for the preparation of the illeg@@ ally celebrated Black Caviar , the racing Sunday treatment generally &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack carrier or sound had been applied to the horse @-@ debate , which is hidden against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistak@@ enly called on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been all day long , so what was like that .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who ask these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy causes ri@@ vals to fight against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy makes criticism of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator lists the tie @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a scar@@ red note about the Storm Team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample set &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland is not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy , the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b defended his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team gave him confident , because it de@@ cri@@ bes that they were worried about being be@@ aten out of a Storm team .
&quot; this always comes up - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about Ring@@ fights spoke , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in all year we have changed nothing at our house@@ sive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles to a real centre and this has been done for us at the turn .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is strange how this time shows up again at this time of time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he was compared to his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a di@@ so@@ ck .
but now he has a team who can play and see that in exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the b@@ allet , which you would like to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these .
I have increased confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably had not thought of us when it was around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster showed a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and no points are a bit stretching ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
if they mention us it means that we will meet in a phase even more .
the Storm team has at this weekend free as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the Final in A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Cau@@ tion for Drug Ad@@ diction
a man , who may possibly a lifetime punishment threatened because of its being , owned by 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine who were scr@@ at@@ ched to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ released .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and presented in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the early morning and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police were 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of dro@@ ge in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly lifetime punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there may be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole host and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
during the pris@@ ons , he left the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the reve@@ aling statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to keep it from it , not to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , met at the police daily and get to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cells are decent
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel in Te@@ gel , which was once a monthly slope to a small cell .
because of the infrin@@ gement of their lives , prisoners tend to be entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells .
this has decided the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht in a decision issued on Wednesday .
the persons affected can then even hope for money if only a few days they were imprison@@ ed within the too narrow rooms ( AZ . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ prison@@ er with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spatial / non @-@ separated .
after that , the man , who is again on free walking according to his law , has been moved into a larger cell .
his counter@@ part conditions due to the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however the Constitu@@ tional Court was raising the jud@@ gement of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and referred to the case for renewed testing .
they see the human dignity of the man .
Kammer@@ ger@@ ich will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons reported from the question@@ able period only a few days of to@@ tt@@ age for the compensation was decisive , it meant to be an equ@@ alization .
otherwise , &quot; a short@@ cut of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al has now to be clar@@ ified to the amount of dental damage .
the Constitu@@ tional govern@@ ors have often strengthened the rights of pris@@ ons in the past .
so they said only in April of a prison@@ er &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant , because he was bare in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also that the multi @-@ level of a cell is also without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in addition , the Berlin constitutional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Constitu@@ tional Court began to certi@@ fy a decent housing in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines for the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore again enclosed again 23 hours , which sever@@ ity himself , due to the tense situation there have been already .
according to information on the Just@@ iz@@ press@@ est@@ elle are 21 places in Te@@ gel for post @-@ gou@@ ch@@ angels not occupied , 19 shall not fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to take them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to accommodate a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge . &quot; I am saying again and again : we can create it , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
revenues for different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) is annually - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all at affordable rental property : annually , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 welfare can be picked out of the flat rate , and in order to apply these especially favourable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion of double , at least 518 million at one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ el Institute ; 80 thousand social apartments have to develop and that the federal government would have to invest in the level of 6.4 billion per year .
the scientists and Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for labour market research and vocational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugee camps can be carried out in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not at all interested in their qualification to help them start getting started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees is crucial , whether they are working in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording group , but also for the esteem of the Zu@@ w@@ other , says migrant researchers Diet@@ rich th@@ än@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany it has given a political change according to th@@ än@@ hardt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the service offered by refugees to recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while earlier a working @-@ ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years had been reduced , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dual light , the asylum seek@@ ers to a location is limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view for@@ cements that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
so far , there is no right choice of general and professional @-@ related voice @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs most often shared by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore according to th@@ ri@@ b@@ ills of the Royal trip to the employment integration .
the Berlin school administration has stated that only a few refugees receive their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent , &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ libr@@ arian , Spe@@ aker for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless provided by the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of Hand@@ ett@@ el in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators to rise strongly influenced by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - by att@@ acking more technical schools .
in the countries students are being prepared without a German knowledge in welcome @-@ service to the lessons .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack ; Beate St@@ emp@@ t says of the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or commemor@@ ated the study - the only exception was to Berlin , In@@ dic@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
study @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university .
for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement or tro@@ users do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ ers law , if they start studying .
the latter basically will not get a BA@@ Fö@@ G because it does not fall under the circle of the equ@@ ali@@ ans .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this Span@@ i@@ ards fell to 15 months .
but this financing must also be shut down , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should un@@ tie the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches able to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio .
important would also be the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights also belong duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must be clear to a clear contact person and agree to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately lost their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said he in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
in future integration will be much more than today a topic of society .
this will also have to change the majority of the majority , the reduction of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination condition and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it goes very slowly , how the NS@@ U &apos;s series will be learned to be systematically ignored by the police and authorities in the police and authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migration organizations and stakeholders are calling for a long time , and why international agreements as anti @-@ racial corporations in Germany must be a reality in the next few years , when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide healthcare medic@@ ally , the hi@@ red refugees Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , factors do not need to flow for additional money into the system .
in order to avoid the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all ees , will be charged immediately in the registration of the health cards .
brought services could be p@@ ayed later by the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people have the restricted performance catalog to see the asylum @-@ performance law .
otherwise the doctors are doing above all to create language barriers .
in the past so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be considered to be un@@ solved only to their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical pract@@ itioner needs interpre@@ ter costs , they require .
it would be helped many refugees too , but also with more general medical doctors in the emergency surgery .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are some more un@@ acted people under refugee centres , and for the young people there is about HIV clar@@ ification .
with the partial other cases of disease , German doctors think about their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ it@@ enbe@@ ck or Tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and in terms of anger , be dimin@@ ished by the refugees or even in sight .
the Syrian would have a highly developed education system , several refugees or even doctors .
in order to practice it , however , they would have to prove their qualification and have no means to take examination once again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany to come to refugees ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is ill : most suffer from post traum@@ atic exposure to diseases or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; specially vulnerable to the refugee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of the Technical University of Munich proves that every five @-@ th Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post traum@@ atic exposure to a post traum@@ atic exposure , it suff@@ ers from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death scar@@ es .
further symptoms are ins@@ om@@ nia and concentr@@ ations of concentration , strong sho@@ cking and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to avoid that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , stated amm@@ z .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
while psych@@ isch @-@ sick asylum seek@@ ers can present a request for Psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months to process .
in addition , in the welfare of workers mostly experts or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites for dre@@ aming
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst October &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cir@@ cus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to pull any age group in the b@@ ann of fascinating rob@@ atics , animal and hydr@@ ali@@ ous entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst loads in the cir@@ cus on the brick , was@@ hes for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine without my circulation family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Tier@@ lehr@@ erin and Jun@@ orch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current appointment .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family .
so the gift to am@@ aze the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is important to take away people from their day @-@ to @-@ day and take it for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Junior orch@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ tails with Welt@@ stadt @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international Cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in her b@@ ann .
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the st@@ umm@@ ings it wants to make the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
your humor@@ ous art on m@@ ast aims to con@@ quer women &apos;s her@@ zen in the storm .
besides being fascinated by numerous sal@@ mon sal@@ ves the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also with finger@@ tips and laughter .
with the unic@@ y@@ cle on a ball bal@@ ancing ?
for He Yuan no problem .
snake &apos;s fascin@@ ate and troub@@ led at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little else and fascinated with their ag@@ ility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal rights groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also does not take a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go well to our animals , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read according to the possibility of every wish of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel not at ease , it does not want to go into the sle@@ ek .
the Supreme Comm@@ and@@ ment is therefore : good for the animals to be concerned .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ te , the family is pro@@ ud@@ est .
the two animals have lived in one ear for eight years and nothing is happening .
&quot; but suddenly , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the cir@@ cus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so for each visitor , it is likely to be something .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst loads between 17 and 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
moreover , every day the animal @-@ look is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe hält wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ äl@@ zer leader , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the case of the fall was quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament also hop@@ ed by the members of the opposition to obtain an anonymous death penalty and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bug .
last month she bu@@ ked him and had interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS messages have received on their phones they warned against it , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ af .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
they warned the parliamentary members that the imm@@ unity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
Chief Econom@@ ists said the Party of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is concerned about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will later be split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job creation leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , he said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it &apos;s HP today and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
there has been a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to manufacture electric plants and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is named &apos; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has run a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
little stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after the plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four matches for England and is certainly uncertain due to its history , in the next summer on the European Championship .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate dum@@ plings sk@@ irt and then again found to its old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well cur@@ led .
this is not a major concern .
it was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with his k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ es or with the injury he had previously had .
this may be true of purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , always when a player is trying to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd shares 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ than 157 Lig@@ ue in the last five times .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Club who have been able to record most vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win war@@ fare , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deser@@ ved .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am hot@@ sp@@ ur on the coming Wednesday , and turning out into a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta starts .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wall@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to break a small break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
even though an ar@@ sen@@ al favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the greatest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake which were measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th to Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al the apprentic@@ eship has drawn from the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and remains of far hope to lead the association with its management to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close to 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy Show , who gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now still un@@ question@@ able than ever before , how self @-@ murder among young men are shown on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch .
in 2013 , it was the most important death toll in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ico ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ al life ) in 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of bringing the culture into question , the men are hin@@ der to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school pupils with de@@ pressed symptoms made that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , hal@@ ved a circle of intellectu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you only have to have friends in order that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media @-@ led communication , with its emphasis on style on substance , however , the in@@ compatibility of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have the need to seem strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound .
and like a video sample @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the Beautiful at Friends has been that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , made by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer football and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can refer to any case , even if they often fall back , fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the hot@@ line I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ mur@@ dered , I really clearly showed me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I comp@@ m with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term settlement mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much , my objective out@@ sider &apos; status on the phone the person in moments of despair may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you are visiting this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why don &apos;t you then take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and tell you hello .
you never know what kind of friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani to his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and ends PSG to mobil@@ ise on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game @-@ report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani retained course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday starting .
di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way but afterwards it adjusted a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their lead to be increased as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball@@ on .
with Real Madrid and Sh@@ ei@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs to start a strong start against the Swedish master as it didn &apos;t only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ um rounds , but an improvement in the way to quar@@ ry in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents &apos; problems and look back , even if there are certain things we must have in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury , in one of three changes to the Paris team which could last on weekends a 2 : 2 oun@@ ced on his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was re @-@ sto@@ cked in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wing of action was considered to be the man to take the PSG to the next stage in Europe , and he clar@@ ified on why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and ended pretty into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PSG would win a great win , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off sco@@ red to achieve this level , occurred at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nationalities in the field and was ran@@ ked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field pic@@ kl@@ ed a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which went far to Kevin A@@ stri@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , put them little in the attack .
instead he was log@@ ged on , with some pat@@ ches and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had deployed him after the rest@@ art .
nevertheless , he pointed a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria into a fil@@ ming , which was caught by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay sco@@ op@@ ed his sixth sauna , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a le@@ ft@@ ist side by Max@@ well .
this ended up all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game and only an excellent entrance from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could hold the final result low before spare @-@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end .
the Trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later a class over his team played and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hut from front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
Matt Dam@@ on confront@@ ational the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said she will not require behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , acting as this the need for alternative perspectives , with regards to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with off@@ beat monsters and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ zent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lay Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the Show @-@ Fin@@ alist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to deal with the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is be@@ aten from her white border .
the producer of De@@ ar White People composed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , for the direction of direction to the film ; Dam@@ on inv@@ aded that their direc@@ ting &quot; could give us something we could not want . &quot;
after discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ des into dis@@ appro@@ vals on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter @-@ user Mr Po@@ oni firmly urged his anger about the clip , by talking &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the fore@@ front of the social discussion .
after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer , the movement has been hit Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter land@@ es@@ far effect and pressed laws and authorities to discrimin@@ ate discrimin@@ atory practices against conflict @-@ areas .
in February the singer Prince Prince hold a play@@ on to the movement during the introduction of the nomin@@ ated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still Mat@@ ter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , some albums are still their meaning .
over recent times , leaders of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and may consider a response to the question of Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be considered as a H@@ ass Group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leader .
recently , I was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
professional sport clim@@ bers and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete which won the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the competition show , which ended up their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could conclude all levels of his tab@@ ern@@ acle .
during seasonal fluctu@@ ations there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , down to the final .
on the last task the climbing was climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the time , which he completed the first ath@@ l@@ ete which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge in full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought win , still under shock above the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although it ended the course of the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he will get one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ eps about anything else .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , I am happy that he is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think he would have felt as though they changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was extended for an a@@ unt season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit tiger .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American league Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , this part played on Tuesday perfect against Min@@ nes@@ ota t@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins had a chance for Ascension within a margin of the Houston area of Ast@@ ros for the second American league Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F words that had been so difficult to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad stands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support , when Detroit reti@@ red three times in the first two minds , then once in the sixth and then once more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made it possible for three branches .
it was only his third @-@ successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of every game , and therefore I want to fully concentrate in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ day hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has well cur@@ ved the drums , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the bull &apos;s training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ pen , and he carried it directly into the game .
with three b@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy covered wall , the only man who was confronted with , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who has escap@@ ed a two @-@ run by the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finish @-@ run on the second set Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe for a Double Play .
it was this in the Major League &apos;s premi@@ ère December 27th , in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was equipped with Double Play
after Detroit added at the end of the ninth interior of the Insurance Run , the wall of a R@@ BI , against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and obtained the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed st@@ ach however , however , S@@ ano can save three pitches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game by another yet movable Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three branches in the first two intro@@ duc@@ tions against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been del@@ ayed before the game from the off@@ ending list , after having been missing for a back in over a month .
&quot; obviously , not the beginning I wanted to call , &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I felt relaxed and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ man , h@@ iring got a single turn on Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed to create another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed on the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not get very well be@@ aten , but he did the right place .
Hu@@ ghes was in a pitch @-@ count@@ down , generated no points in the third inning , prior to being replaced by the re@@ efs juris@@ dictions A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ ghes she came to three branches with six hits and a walk with four car@@ ke@@ outs .

Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU countries have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take place on next Tuesday ( 22 September ) in a special meeting to take a new con@@ centric distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ time and distribution of men .
the federal government , in cooperation with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ day consultation with the Prime Minister in the law office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who bri@@ ds the protection , conf@@ ess this too .
but who does not have a lead to lead , could not remain in Germany too .
this opinion was badly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole will now manage a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rome has now a Martin Luther &apos;s Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now an Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , on Wednesday one previously un@@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill were b@@ apti@@ zed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation .
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the work of the evangel@@ ical Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith .
the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as Pr@@ ün@@ den@@ b@@ abel .
his negative impressions w@@ led him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated with his th@@ eses about the las@@ hed trade in the spl@@ end@@ ent of the Anglo @-@ American church .
hammer artist invest@@ s three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible has painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and recorded bi@@ ased painting .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible who now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ j@@ alt , who made his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations bi@@ blical story on paper and canvas in 150 Mot@@ i@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , adapted to each specific subject , this may well be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he made a subjective an artistic selection of the many them@@ atic areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; books of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were created cycles , which devote topics like Kreu@@ zwe@@ g , Pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
with this , he was spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : the same applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and that is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , based on painting with the respective be@@ off@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biography of Ot@@ mar Alt selected bi@@ ds and thus translated into the today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ale mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible &apos;s Bible from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thought about the situation .
the cas@@ cade of gold has Golden Let@@ ters .
this allows 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal to twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ iger@@ ode was born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who hal@@ ted the strict Protest@@ ant ruling class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education has already happened with the tube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up , to go to the Lord again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ define the art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of educational accounts is marked today by Re@@ kl@@ ame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is going out there .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ tima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ tima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to let the spect@@ ator go into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday with the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bibel in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , who has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like he is compreh@@ end with his paintings . &quot;
old I have not desp@@ ised to capture the Bible completely , but that is chosen for him important , including mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely clar@@ i@@ fies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; 1 &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a photo @-@ bi@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Bilder speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn nah@@ t
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
om@@ issions in politics and administration used for suspected , especially in the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
so hills shi@@ el@@ ded , new place sought - well with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , the first congreg@@ ation in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been sent to the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is even visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga team a clear sign in the weekend .
football is responding to the foot@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its assistance in addressing the problems &apos;s forthcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge for our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing nobody to say in principle that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting to get a handle on this topic under the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet there the leadership of Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can help and w@@ ool .
but the decisive ordination has to place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football Association made his refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A @-@ Tagung in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some Bundes@@ liga will support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine represent a clear sign , when they are on the left of Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the usual standard sponsor@@ ship ( Her@@ mes ) the expression &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Leverkusen Sport@@ chief Rudi Völ@@ cker der &quot; Bild &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and said the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is every one allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can state football players , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
to the EM Quali@@ fication game against Hungary this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Saale
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach identified the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences had in their places have started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year the association will work with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government at 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they already called for the whole amount for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ stand@@ ings loses an eye in an accident
the head of the head of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported several reports on the left @-@ hand eye by a fall in early July .
when the accident at the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the US he was after midnight on a water @-@ glass he carried in his left hand , the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is power@@ less , it was power@@ less , then out to@@ wed out onto the road - which he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can then prove his work .
&quot; beginning of October we meet before the supervis@@ ory board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Sin@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full unemployment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I got all the time in a regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and its chairman of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ uted usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history told the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; everybody can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; importantly , to stand back if you really fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except free@@ zing ...

he therefore comes at night in Singapore on the weekend as well as reservations for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes were definitive for a com@@ eback of Marco re@@ us in the first group game of Europe League .
the national player becomes the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 07 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot go back to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether in the Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Leverkusen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to exercise on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel its regular eleven will change only on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door @-@ position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ oun@@ ter takes place in the place of tri@@ bal Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether the White @-@ eller in the future in all the Europa @-@ league games was used , tu@@ chel left however open .
by high probability , he will also tie the second of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the acceler@@ ation statement from co @-@ players re@@ us that the fin@@ al@@ locate for the BV@@ B in Europe League will be the target of mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the lead for Germany
Germany should at the end of the German government for the change of the car technological pioneer .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic Paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the fair I@@ AA by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected car will increase traffic safety and ensure less steel , &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry in the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport sets , among other things , emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band and an additional level of ascent on digital radio funk .
the testing of new technology is currently being created a test ride on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; will review the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary , adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , Germany wants to work around an international level that the permitted maximum speed of more self @-@ driving cars will be raised by 10 to 130 hours .
the Federal Government will also opt for a change in the Vienna Convention which has only seen people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible on motor@@ ways to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads were not expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in the location of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the lor@@ ries can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the drivers were clearly clar@@ ified .
however , the German self @-@ driving cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey conducted by the For@@ sa @-@ Institut on behalf of the Test Dec@@ om@@ isation , comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that the autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent continue to believe in 20 years with it , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in case the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a collection of the digital network , Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would be appro@@ ve of total control over the entire journey on all roads .
in the highway that could result in flowing transport at least 15 per cent , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
almost everyone was allowed to leave the car under no circumstances .
b@@ oll says team@@ - and @-@ start at Tis@@ cht@@ en@@ nis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will take place after a jet@@ sch at the Tit@@ le , from 25 September to 4 October only in single .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Ms Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf .
this time , B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer as a clear Favor@@ ite , &quot; explained single @-@ action Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the S@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ statt too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo was missing and we are Europ@@ am@@ ante . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ record ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer team of Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn up a serious injury on the right foot .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a En@@ f@@ ant y
it is a combination of very great mo@@ den@@ schau and a qu@@ artet in Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaulle tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ quin , which are striking of the video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the mo@@ de@@ scene - and with it that he put it into na@@ cke .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant y the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was not easy , meanwhile it is really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Bürger@@ stei@@ g to see the cat@@ walk ) which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his first @-@ year attitude toward a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been against it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already made the Canadian Montreal and Paris station before .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion history has written without ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an amaz@@ ingly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was committed .
14 tons of material have r@@ acked the makers after details of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October , there was a special treat : a h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gaul@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ qu@@ itted mo@@ an attempt of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he was attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and d@@ resses , Gaul@@ tier said .
playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the design of fashion he later brought himself to himself .
he st@@ ole fashion @-@ magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich told .
later I bought but of course bought .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the b@@ els .
they got nothing , they were able to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long stick@@ ers in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embro@@ ider@@ y fabrics and peaks emerged in great quantity for customers , which they worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip played a greater role , then pushed by the home industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and on regional trac@@ tions .
even fine the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ fashion , who re@@ jects himself on past stit@@ ches , an increase of contract .
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany are no longer available on the market .
they are already half of all orders with us .
Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ ys together with nine other companies are a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s top and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of the revenues were broken .
private specialist stores and the wholes@@ aler , there is almost no more .
our products reach the customer in this way hardly still .
nowadays , the mass ware would have produced a lot cheaper in the Asian region and are distributed almost exclusively via chains .
moreover , de@@ bil@@ le of export , currently in Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new routes .
the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we are leading a quality si@@ e@@ gel that shows that we can produce ec@@ ologically and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ a designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ part of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Art - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that primarily need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varying in order to maintain a customer base .
a couple of years animated cur@@ tail@@ ed Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter the historic snow@@ b@@ point new .
send the machine at some places small ch@@ icks .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ tigh@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ cks seemed to inspire him : &quot; before I was nothing to start with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the Snow@@ fl@@ point for their jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies the United States , to Australia and Finland - primarily in their customers whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who wish to re@@ membran@@ ce .
so I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Sp@@ itz .

according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; however , it is not about new releases but a kind of continuation , which 20 years after the first film plays with the mag@@ ici@@ an child .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the Banks in times of the financial crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI pus@@ hes the economy to open wider for the world
the economy must open itself wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group which was commissioned with the ste@@ ering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to boost foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address with the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ alizing and forward reforms will drive new momentum and vitality will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity @-@ list to settle the market , relaxing , border controls ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of melan@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a greater role in the resources of resources , ensuring a legally state business environment and design the market open , says the statement .
the government is also sent to control over the powers transferred to companies and make sure that companies decide how to conduct business .
the Statement also said that China will allow the border areas to explore new models of trans@@ national economic governance and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for the countries to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ pler was and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ nan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants double to double b@@ eck@@ lage mar@@ vel in rob@@ ber@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits of mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve mostly .
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who is pre @-@ established , critic@@ ized the plans are sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are forwar@@ ded with full weight and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said that the limits of the nerve @-@ toxic lead to great fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of one on two milli@@ gram of Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
great rap@@ tors have already been so strongly deb@@ ited today with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still valid setting principles about 50 percent of the fil@@ th should not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limits values then only 14.@@ 5 percent is negoti@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ ting the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the EU @-@ vis the limits on other fish@@ ings of other fish@@ ings of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
food@@ watch drew this , however , as a &quot; trick &quot; because of smaller cemetery , such as car@@ riages are mostly so low because they have already engra@@ ved the planned down@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sen@@ ing in cl@@ ot@@ ish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that helps only the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a po@@ ison@@ ous increase in the humans , particularly strong across the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts particularly in the n@@ atives of the nervous system can cause &quot; even small amounts . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains its homepage with regard to the current maximum @-@ values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; to the general population is not to be expected .
