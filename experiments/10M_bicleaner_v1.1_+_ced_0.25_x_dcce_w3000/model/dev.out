Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ ran@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there should also be a question about the conflict with the Palestinians and the co @-@ discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous sett@@ ling of Israel and casts a viable manner in the peace process .
through the death of Obama &apos;s death , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March Netanyahu had held an invitation to the Republi@@ can party at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Convention , held partly as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the election in Israel .
on a call , Professor , his girlfriend ersch@@ ossen
on a call was Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , that he was shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family record of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials met the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to go on a white block : &quot; I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was after details of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was transported to the police a popular histor@@ ian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ ze@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ité Ac@@ tions heard at 10 : 18 am .
he said that he did the p@@ au@@ ful call of time after that day .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life , when the police officers him .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
those from the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students said that they were on their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ ent@@ is died , said , he did not have history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both planted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ators 17 members includes , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations of problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised God , he was also a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of 2014 .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University for health reasons for health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he set up only two online courses .
last changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doc@@ toral degree did not work hard for the Lamb so hard for him to represent no guarantee of an automatic approach to a Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight from campus the police found Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Ark@@ ans@@ as again in the Mississippi river .
before he was arrested , he was scr@@ ap@@ ed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
its car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he pro@@ mo@@ ated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met together by joint friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her guitar playing .
he was then the woman of woman .
all girls mel@@ ted that when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson fo@@ aming of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and have had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he did not meet , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb is interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both on a summer time .
later they played together one or another G@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter write and sing her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes maintenance coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 . September for the last time he finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ harmon@@ ic game in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there were no evidence that anything did not vote .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were alive and cher@@ ished together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the Elec@@ toral Programme and specialized in American indigenous people , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the up@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and he was President of his Br@@ otherhood , and the students Committee .
on Tuesday evening of the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland took part in the Tuesday evening about 900 people including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ lit ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ mal section , during the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are taken again on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ener P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to conf@@ ess that the police now says that he had shot the emergency , and that Lamb in its call Pr@@ ent@@ is indeed marked as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever got married .

Michael J. Fox Ad@@ ts about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the Roy@@ als , and I know that the seat is empty beside me and it will gradually realize that Princess Diana is sitting beside me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me to the sense that I am a simul@@ ated g@@ aps and a arm@@ rest length of it , with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales on a date .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria , &quot; There is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of permanent conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader again calls on all parties , including the agreed UN Security Council to join and to support an inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .

Ban called on the five permanent members to show the equal solidarity and unity in Syria making the same solidarity and unity in order to reach a nuclear de@@ as with Iran .
8 Re@@ quest@@ s that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to put it as flop @-@ brand marks .
others did it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper races in surveys down , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls show Donald Tr@@ ump in double dig@@ it area , and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the estate market .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that wearing probably will win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts empha@@ size that at that time in the year 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which no one won even a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ ans Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognis@@ ing iner@@ umps and begin to let their dollar flow out to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period :
Tr@@ ump@@ ing@@ Pop@@ ular specifications have turned around 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ ature mid @-@ June announced a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans looked in the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l .
until the middle of July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now six out of 10 ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures differ in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa has stated last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if it would be fin@@ ely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son takes about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ can sees m@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for their bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans tend to have critic@@ ised the real temper@@ ament for a president , N@@ ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre@@ valence of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a com@@ mander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent do not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and nearly six of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament does not cast into the White house p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put their gel @-@ hardness , republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who asked the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation win , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this has been a change since the time when four out of July put their money on Je@@ any Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past were not the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans were thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters are considered ch@@ att@@ ing campaign .
even when the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans turned around another candidate , it runs almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the frag@@ mentation field probably contributes to tr@@ umps &apos;s leadership , distributed during the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that at a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump are harvest@@ ed multi @-@ health support .
he has before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points prot@@ ru@@ sion , prior to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ die and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only can@@ did@@ at who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would pick up the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ er support , say that they have proclaimed their votes .
of course , a lot has to happen in order to change that and no one can truly say the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to altern@@ ate candidates .
nevertheless , stret@@ cher is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their mind , are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum for the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic di@@ pres@@ sions of tr@@ ump will be remote from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light it will seem to be Donald Tr@@ ump into effect .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new peak .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now decl@@ ines around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry on Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated over the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive accomodation in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive home facility - with a view over the North Sea .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited , meaning it is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special le@@ agues a square meter at most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
beyond doubt Tor@@ p@@ ze in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern den Weg zu a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran .
a sou@@ se@@ er the Champions League of the Champions League .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have restricted the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ re@@ aus , launched a dream start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her pre@@ l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek Rek@@ ord@@ master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th anniversary of the series is to be the first step in the final direction of final on 28 May 2016 where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received during his 28th place in the Champions League at the Bavaria &apos;s leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as the flan@@ k @-@ thought shot of the world &apos;s g@@ utter .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; had promised Bavaria Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ akis , before 3@@ 1,6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the Mün@@ chner stopped .
they showed a concentrated and engaged performance , without sh@@ iny .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his recent six home games in the top class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , the Bavaria , un@@ defeated within seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ ella and Greek team did not want to be the next victim .
they went gr@@ ac@@ tly , with their bare efforts but often to be mon@@ opol@@ ised .
the attacks have been led to often per scope mo@@ t on Lin@@ ks@@ burg Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ forced against the earlier Braun@@ er Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ou@@ i rarely .
Müller took on the right more luck , when his side bur@@ ns from the right half @-@ field in the left @-@ hand corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion of the possible 2 : 0 .
best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ye Brown the head@@ ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by Direct , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee par@@ ched ( 35 . ) .
although the Bavaria has moved its usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set up needle .
on Tor@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was Lost .
so approximately , as he made a shot of inv@@ ali@@ ye about the lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ c@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero just gave after the final training green light , said Sport@@ sch@@ ema Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 06 ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller sat up a dr@@ on .
in front of the game , it was drawn in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly li@@ cking Bavaria @-@ fans in her audience @-@ block , apparently the supporters of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and ge@@ stu@@ res had prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ b@@ loc@@ s against the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least a Bayern fan was wo@@ unded from the stadium .
who smok@@ es , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smok@@ es , dro@@ ves thus not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er term study near .
the good news : when compar@@ isons the risk dimin@@ ished .
smok@@ ers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is made out of a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutr@@ ition@@ ists ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to lose the 2.5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had more than 23,@@ 300 participants observed .
root causes of tooth dec@@ ay be c@@ aries and inflammation of the fl@@ esh@@ y , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between cigar@@ ette smoking and bal@@ loss is therefore going back on most common denti@@ als in smoking .
not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth dec@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who were listening with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ards sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smok@@ ers , declared first author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can convince people of it , no smoking , explained the leader of a Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good tooth health down to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 is affected by dental treatment , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking the risk for early diagnosis of heat .
the new long @-@ term study en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
on the improvement of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private slo@@ gans for disputes between corporations and states are to be dis@@ solved by a transparent system which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes in his way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to di@@ gest the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Schwe@@ din , presented the proposal as a European negotiating position in the trade @-@ free talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is to create the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings argue that EU states and the US can work together independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to have equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , it is also a second instance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it is intended to work for its own information on an International Investment Court .
in this respect , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU could be clar@@ ified .
especially of the most major investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel , on the companies such as compensation , national laws and lo@@ ve@@ able reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organizations such as Camp@@ act were adopted proposals by the European Commission as insufficient .
it was first critic@@ ized that they are not intended to apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secret@@ ary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) marked the plans for a great progress on the other hand .
the Commission considered essential points in the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als was from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Unit of Business@@ Europe war@@ ns to limit the cl@@ auses of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium enterprises may be dis@@ advant@@ aged by it , it says .

Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy real folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with fil@@ tering .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost sei@@ zed by Stev@@ ens .
he relates to various places he has always shown on the map and reported on his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs that harmon@@ ious very close to American Folk in the late six@@ ties but at all times a great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a hiding series : each of the 50 US federal states will be subsequently taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , already in 2004 and in the Rhein@@ land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and still has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces Stev@@ ens here on .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
mit &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Illin@@ oise , &quot; ) will be a super@@ ficial master@@ piece in 2005 .
remains of ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic Fin@@ esse .
the album rises to the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks a list of influ@@ ential music media outlets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served himself to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic units . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but carried by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
for long the smaller clubs dropped off , the stage shows are shown here to the colour@@ ful spectac@@ le from the ne@@ on forehead and great fluores@@ cent bul@@ le@@ de@@ ko .
currently tour@@ t Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ piece band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ captured ham@@ burger More !
theat@@ res he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; since March . &quot;
although here almost 2000 guests are sc@@ anned in their chairs , the highly mature Stev@@ ens returns to intimacy and for folk .
without setting a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; out of the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you could throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens book@@ marks , plays a few older songs and finally incl@@ ined to a tos@@ sing appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the presentation of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to attend the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s thesis and put forward the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to mid@@ day the first of its six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be checked and by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as it comes after his appointment as member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ et and after his speech at the Tu@@ c presentation convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ ce of the National Bank at a memorial party to the 7@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to be prov@@ oked , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory steps , and stands at the center of multiple Tit@@ anic stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Luft@@ schl@@ acht around England . &quot;
but one member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ mn , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team and she called on differences in economics , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ th of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party had originally supported him as a guide .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also within Labour &quot; for@@ ks &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limit on winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c @-@ conference , that Labour Party changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ ent ministers said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the ruling plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president who has since David Cameron in the last decade to face the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour Chairman , who promised a different policy support , says that he &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the reflection of the Prime Minister is too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confront@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he has made both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; percussion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ ps with resistance to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Juan , the shadow of economics and minister he is represented , if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he spoke to John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the shelter . I talked about the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often associated with the reflection of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he sp@@ ans that he failed .
since they were officially sent in 1990 on TV during the year 1990 , the question@@ ers of the leader of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliamentary report , has argu@@ ed , she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and has made extensive reforms .

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches ground @-@ standing campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - En@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Boden@@ stan@@ tive campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia will be prepared early next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A due to mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealer and suppliers jump on board with brands like ice manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop owners , which sell tickets to the South Australian football liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be out more details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ alers for food , alcohol and devices prov@@ oked its annual investors Strateg@@ ic Day .
es is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A shop ju@@ ices and generate higher profits as a met@@ aph@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ oral provincial and Ig@@ A retailers come across a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets approximately five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all available players , but mainly independent retailers sales .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath gave Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A retailers might lose 360 million revenues per year and Met@@ cash 250 million US $ by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up to 25 office in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million US $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and in the amounts of a high @-@ cas@@ hing high fix@@ ation , Met@@ cash might cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A means is the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes about 3.8 per cent in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to react publicly to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a stand@@ point of Met@@ cash received contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ GA@@ s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and income from met@@ cas@@ hing food and food trading , which has been supplied by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects its operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler w@@ ai@@ ds however and invest@@ s more than 150 million prizes in order to enhance the prices of CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ qu@@ ins for hundreds of products every week to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private food products .
Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prize adjustment and charging programs to be moved and hopes that the wholes@@ alers in 2017 will return to earnings growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis truly deserves praise as criticism of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves after View of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred back as &quot; special k@@ s &quot; was also known as &quot; special k@@ s with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after such co@@ k@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was separated twice through the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison had called , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka would have to beat with Cyr@@ bat , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was most recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ er after a Kr@@ amp@@ f had a potential US Open victory against Richard Gas@@ quet , C@@ k@@ akis was advoc@@ ated from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in competition with Sam Groth - the second place in the Singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I get quite enth@@ r@@ ably , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little escap@@ ed in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he broke out a r@@ acket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has changed in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature man , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he is still struggling a problem with other players , he is well trained ; he is well in form , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , which begins on Friday , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; with &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has done very quickly the climb was made to people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has made him wonder what he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amps which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border to refugees
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and sm@@ iled the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally to the land . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants are located in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who were flying before violence were fought for an un@@ familiar time in a stri@@ pe on the road between the two control points of the countries and er@@ ected tents , and settled down there .
but Fru@@ it@@ ating st@@ ain from .
as a police @-@ helic@@ opter about them , the migrants &apos; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ emen .
some pointed out of protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bian foreign ministers declared it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ ater@@ al damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica dac@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence on the ung@@ ar@@ c @-@ Ser@@ b border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels to arrange a joint immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were sear@@ ched in over Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would pick another 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however did not set his hopes for an initial action between Brussels or his neighbors .
the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could ha@@ st@@ ain roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also envis@@ aged the construction of a thorn @-@ tz@@ a@@ we along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having ended a fence at the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ments can be used at the race track , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant driving force in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister of Viktor Or@@ ban was insi@@ sted that most people are seeking better lives , rather than the refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight of Hungary in force , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher pressure factors for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government speaker z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still has to agree with the use of the military or dis@@ agree that is expected for next week , but Rep@@ orter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen the border difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already tag@@ ged .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US State Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double dig@@ it rise in the democratic race for nomin@@ ation at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the Pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while others stands in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet proclaimed , whether he acts for the presidential office , gets support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the election .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say it too early to say that their opinion is on what candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters in their choice are more fluid than that of the other candidates .
Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton is holding a big edge in women and co@@ cks , but these le@@ aps have reduced .
your support in men has decreased notic@@ e@@ ably , and in different matters here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons plus for democratic voters in the age of 50 have s@@ ni@@ fied , and they and customs are now at the same height .
Clinton has a long lead in the older voters .
in the last month , Clinton had a two @-@ dig@@ it jump in the liber@@ als , but otherwise has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the Pre @-@ elections were saying that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some periods and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons are actual supporters mainly from it .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
as 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ sur@@ elections say it should support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ub@@ can voters this about their n@@ itz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question are asked , why they want to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time to be a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
it was also supported by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and choosing @-@ ability will also be cited .
as the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top .
prepared by Clin@@ tons followers more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead .
decide to run for nomin@@ ation of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate in the best chances to win the choice ; however , this figure is reduced from 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second to this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; voting &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , in question of what is more important when a candidate is called democratic voters regarding the voting .
similarly as in the last month no single democratic can@@ did@@ at or potential can@@ did@@ at for these elec@@ tor@@ ate has emerged as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates provide good results with some important features by choosing the pres@@ sel@@ ections of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den cuts in three candidates best starting at honest@@ y , while clin@@ tons strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not consider any opinion of it .
democratic voters of the Pre @-@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have any opinion from different .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons , use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters are cont@@ ented with their statement on the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated from her .
there are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say their views of Clinton is worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the constitu@@ ent land@@ es@@ far also sees Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump are good notes in leadership .
of the six tested candidates make Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush at the best in honest@@ y .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of it .
the error rate for the sam@@ pling of 3@@ 51 US voters in the pre@@ cip@@ itation amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son backward survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
half of the candidates fall over by now the half of the voters in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support land@@ es@@ far still tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son s@@ avo@@ red at the same time of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups are well received and diver@@ gence between Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in the most profound , namely from 10 % support in the last month on now 2 % .
the former Florida govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % in the third place .
the Er@@ rors in the sam@@ pling of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - he lan@@ det at 19 % support in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view of one on the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ si@@ eves for the former N@@ ine ir@@ ur@@ ges , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask a tr@@ umps believe in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaigns show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of Br@@ otherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after having a student during a moving ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ atur@@ ated will be filed against 5 persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacked ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duc@@ tory duration in September 2013 , and ret@@ ched his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police with .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and has been repe@@ aled , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually l@@ ament@@ ed about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not calling the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ v@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members started to hide and asked the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not re @-@ revi@@ ved , and he died on his wo@@ unds the next morning .
after an auto @-@ seventh p@@ our@@ ning , Den@@ g repeatedly added to the pot@@ ter power violations of the head , tor@@ so , and thig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sever@@ ance of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder of the third gr@@ ades for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for criminal off@@ ences and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make the responsible persons responsible but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , we shall also account this accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has re@@ voke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fork cav@@ ity is coming , and the house will fall into the wa@@ ver , return for bonds and the economy will be gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instructions on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve near raising the interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so fier@@ ce that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could notice , however , that all the excitement because of a Zin@@ ser@@ um may be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Is@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to rise to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here &apos;s a look at historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ del cav@@ ities can be vol@@ at@@ ly for a while .
once the increase comes , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments may be dis@@ continued from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study by what happens after Zin@@ i cav@@ ities of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually last 35 years - on the path to Zin@@ del heights , rather flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then return to the normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield in the last six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob Doll , leader of corporate strategy at nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will appear later in the increasing cycle and return the return in order to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ nia under@@ mining they often promote .
in the current instance the F@@ ed face with some conditions that could not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is being at its lowest point in the position of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , Deutsche Bank had only twice the nominal of GDP in 1950 to 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.7 per cent , only few that this will last and expect to expect the third quarter after the results of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; appearances in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year into a prec@@ eding of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week , which ends on Thursday .
whilst many roads and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , there is the Fut@@ ures trading just one probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all increases @-@ cycles of 1950 to date has taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP has taken place and on @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly following the start of recreation in the shadows , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , waiting since the F@@ ed since the end of last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the firm income was also fol@@ ati@@ l as the market decre@@ ases a fork height , and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares , if they change their strategic course .
when bonds seem to change the return once the first increase / lo@@ wering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the boo@@ ster Cycle , the an@@ lei@@ re@@ end@@ ites exp@@ ire immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates may lead to bringing in return between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ consuming bonds often bring better income from such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ ti@@ ous to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ In@@ come @-@ In@@ come in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Jones notice that the markets already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income gap is fl@@ atter , l@@ ending , and vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy .
within the large and whole , businesses producing the greater part of their business operations in the United States , benefit from interest rates , and local products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt are worse than a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and just as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are extremely positive to respond , three months after an initial fork @-@ height , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the balance sheet of each of the zinc levels in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average each 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt are a major problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most loose , gold man said .
outside the pure share price , consumers will also benefit from the rising sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ parag@@ us could see profits through higher y@@ ields , even if experts from different opinions are , how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ized the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary membership and raises new pressure on the channel , to prove that he does not do something that does not do the privat@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is no longer different from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to tri@@ m the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to become classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also took the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only in another name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director@@ ate dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education about the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never hear about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , find new music and give new works on order , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed of classic music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , while the hearing was held in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .

Internet @-@ based climb@@ ed in August at the s@@ lower and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the expenditure
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been geb@@ o@@ om@@ t , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales divisions of the Guardian .
he stated that the online sales went up three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the couch .
but now it turns out , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon that has been imported from America is cited as a reason for reflec@@ ting turnover .
experts believe that buyers take their purchases in advance of this event , taking place on the last Friday in November .
last year &apos;s field , five times the average number of no@@ ises around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer @-@ sites stopped .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers had been fought for bar@@ gain , buyers to keep away from shopping .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail consortium finds that from 5 £ issues a little more than 1 £ was spent online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases can now be carried out via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of in the mo@@ es in the capitals .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ftsmen is over
British employ increasingly cra@@ ftsmen , says Veroni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified cra@@ ftsmen from Eastern Europe has a rise in itself
this leads to that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are aimed at art@@ is@@ ans , will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will close close
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that British reject their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ ftsmen , who carry out their work in their homes ,
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush that can deal with walls , they are today apparently to a minority .
for British increasingly employ cra@@ ftsmen to perform their pet jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new business manager from King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction sector @-@ chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified cra@@ ftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices are now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open to art@@ is@@ ans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten merch@@ ants in the shop are hit by women .

she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that make more female single @-@ households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move it stronger towards a balance .

functional of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball Viz@@ em@@ aker A@@ ich / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and return .
the accused did not know itself guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for counter@@ insur@@ ers .
from this accus@@ ation he was released in May of legal notice .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ ate Robert Ri@@ ffel arose in the preliminary examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 until 2011 funds raised by associations , about which they were disp@@ uted in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage caused it with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports activities are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
this fact divided the chairman of the opening ceremony , judge Michaela San@@ in , out of .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the draft of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence dar claims that the association has not been formed at any point in time .
the sports working conditions would have been compens@@ ated and the sports club for whom it has been operating from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money from his debts - the Passi@@ va stressed in 2001 approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we keep the club further or un@@ lock it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told one of the accused , at the Br@@ ot@@ ene National In@@ struc@@ tions of the Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been making money for our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the rehear@@ sal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , there must only be no debt .
furthermore , in the financial success , the pay@@ out of the alleg@@ ations were not retro@@ spec@@ tively made until 1991 .
therefore , one section of the provisions have not been compens@@ ated for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been paid on the account .
therefore , it seemed to be a l@@ ump @-@ rate and no detailed view , explained the former Ob@@ lig@@ ation proceedings .
the accounts and austerity are managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second indic@@ tee .
why the pay@@ outs of the association has not been detailed in detail and asked the jud@@ gement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , it is important only for debt of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of the investigations , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement .
the be appropri@@ ately , explained the accused .
this securities account was based on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the question@@ ed did not know an answer .
then he said , he did believe that this is best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have awak@@ ened something of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or introduced into the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , the functioning of the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why compens@@ ate ? , wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
thereafter , the first accused , he had not appro@@ ached with this wording as the association has never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer tells , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the functioning , he has never been related to a pen@@ ny , it is calculated only od@@ ometer and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , he put an invoice to the association 1,000 Euro per month , the actual effort was however much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not identify the accused .
these are con@@ stru@@ ed according to a check in which everything has been judged as accurate , un@@ explained them .
Kilomet@@ ers also had the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all pleas@@ ures are within bar , so he said to drive from his residence , to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the consultation of witnesses .

the time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world is observed if the U.S. stocks are two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 Econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will do a slightly longer and interest rates on the current state from 0 to 0,25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may start the zer@@ os area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel bi@@ des , director of employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and just generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rust@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to stop at an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of taking such a step is good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 Uhr ME@@ Z on Thursday
death penalty at the Delta State University leaving Ent@@ schul@@ dig@@ ungs@@ ungen
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the shot and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he met his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note , to say that it &apos;s been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Do@@ zent for Ge@@ ography and Social Wel@@ ding education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb said the staff of the staff centre , that the police polic@@ emen invites to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house he who is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the ru@@ fer to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as the police received the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notification of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to go it again .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he reported E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , mort@@ al before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen took him around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb sup@@ pos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three relationship &quot; relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ is had a daughter who is 19 , and it was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss her daughter &quot; were absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been written online from home , after the statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ is , who poss@@ essed a dog named Light@@ ning , who has been met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb struck at a certain moment on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ emen him took him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb his car to the side , fled away , ran into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
Lamb awarded in spring 2015 by the Delta State University , a Doctor , like his CV at the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Mon@@ ths because of double causes of double causes
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double frac@@ ture of his right foot .
while this led to the left of the left of the foreign minister and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno after the 20 year old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before it was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has double b@@ einf@@ ra@@ zed and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then fantastic to play , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double carriage , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red map and the suspension of a elli@@ s .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had a mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ p meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account lau@@ tete : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more quickly . &quot;
therein : Manchester United ligh@@ tened the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when defeat the PS@@ V
the England Def@@ enders has an added incentive with the European Championship in France to recover from until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; It is a very limited injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg da@@ w@@ ning when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that there is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was going on in another direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very poor with me . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is going better ?
it is one thing that will soon learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost im@@ pressing .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book decided to call the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 scre@@ ened eco @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is alle@@ ge@@ dly descri@@ bing the stor@@ y@@ line of the book , instead applying a content source of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the silent city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity to see the girl of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads , &quot; read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ stage lau@@ tete and who died in 1991 , but fully unknown .
as if this is not yet verd@@ ant enough : the text presented by Cameron is to be presented in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie showing on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he seems to be a prag@@ mat@@ ous father , it seems unlikely , Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here list@@ ens an un@@ named Once , as the local environment by the nam@@ eless Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ enden , sn@@ ug@@ ging beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; des@@ ol@@ ate .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer who has not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a succ@@ ession .
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come by Camer@@ ons electoral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to stum@@ ble in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , there is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series by not on my card .
I would not ex@@ clude an aw@@ kward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks , may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear the cars of 2012 , only a adol@@ es@@ cent positive attitude .
the ball is developing as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an in@@ known size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this particular message : Adam Ly@@ th cra@@ b out of the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as being his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under tough conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ player have achieved on results .
there was no question mark on Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and that led to nomin@@ ation , since - and I said this - players have their own best selection .
long ago , you would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when he will hopefully see further cycles for Yor@@ k@@ shire it will come another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not put so good performances and that was not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test stroke will get to sit down its mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ accio got the chance to do home and black@@ outs .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England launched first Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean , and was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ es comes in and he is a stroke that I put up high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he met 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which was very close to us .
he must at least receive the same chances as those before him , but it depends of course on the teams in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ vies besides C@@ ook , indic@@ ating what an extra spin @-@ bowl would receive and four qu@@ icks would get , and I have nothing obj@@ ections .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not strike there , and these left @-@ handed has already demonstrated that he is a devil @-@ shot by cri@@ cket players .
mo@@ een might not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on an average of 31 with the r@@ ack@@ ets and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ ans that rise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England has made a couple of clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ an , the Batt@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test@@ games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as player or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the messages are in line with the previous mess@@ enger .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , is not used during the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ party do not determine the schedule .
and you have to think that as with the players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made light heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain from the EU ) could win an allowance , if the economy up to 2017 in a Fl@@ ot@@ tor

foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at work , told that some member states , so deeply sad@@ dened into different crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself created agenda with diver@@ ted conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing cir@@ cl@@ ings which they usually do not want to fill .
in Brigh@@ ton , the tu@@ c decided on their annual general meeting , that it does not like it when they end@@ anger social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sub@@ ie agenda .

it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants a looking outside Great Britain in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass wishes us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , as with the exagger@@ ated long out@@ going like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election , or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a le@@ ft@@ ist .
it falls hard to imagine that they should be a leg to help the self @-@ African British to make their energy better for it , Scotland &apos;s leaving the UK to prevent something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tendencies have .
therefore , possibly some such ministers do not even consider useful comments , quite unlike in the SN@@ P style , during Great Britain &apos;s referendum 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press , as they were during the Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational referendum , but did not have the entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
you can remind themselves of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made themselves a name as an &quot; EU comm@@ ing ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ er years .
with all his cra@@ zin@@ ess knew Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
for this reason , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sh@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ish exter@@ min@@ ions and the p@@ seudo non @-@ foreigners , which have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about it , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you are better ban@@ anas spread to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , mil@@ king band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner than Bl@@ air itself , when he was mis@@ led the referendum on the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ doors .
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly l@@ aps on my back - I told him that he didn &apos;t have any time for me to be wast@@ ed - appears in danger , Neil Kin@@ ki@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC couch he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe - I simply put it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ ous tendency and the wil@@ der vessels of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism , everyone can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no gas@@ oline &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said than the boy sc@@ outs in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ ver@@ end John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father committed himself to his efforts , for@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going to far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
but to fight , to be &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , neither what J@@ C said his fellow @-@ affili@@ ation and Members according to all reports on the Monday evening .
whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will give you - remember that he even touched me - News discipline in the age of TV about the clock important and above all things in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it &apos;s right , Cameron does not give freedom card for Europe that allowed him to keep lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ stupid p@@ amp@@ agne for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think for sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ties for the EU membership - in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ presi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ ion of small f@@ are@@ well is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ties for N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ low@@ ly convinced that Y@@ C do not start a campaign to ex@@ ert - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find in particular a sense of their supervis@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin turn out political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all of it can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost of the T@@ ory government at power , which I was reminded at the start of the Monday of something that British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze reports from Public Health England via E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created out of a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by joining the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the data load@@ ability of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a director in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy basis &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether to build the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ rav@@ , Professor for Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expect that &quot; the current issue is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ specialist decision makers ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead to their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ ous products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ens said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director is previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Initiative ( BA@@ T ) for independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not funding , which he should have received after reports prior to the Tab@@ ak@@ tor Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but include multiple known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also indicate a branch financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco direction of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lowing evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products by most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ ens said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes has been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smok@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J was already responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ er dies at its addiction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to this are small , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term effects to study .
p@@ he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what does not , especially if there are so much public confusion over relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ a year .
by clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former manager of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programmes that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are publicly seen on a smaller audience , which probably will be seen from a smaller audience , in harsh controversial window , against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which were also un@@ ambig@@ uous by not sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you wish to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I consider medium @-@ long or long term , one should do at least make production at least on programs , others do not do or put on behalf .
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous . it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded even without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for this purpose .
I would like to see how this should be publicly available television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC signs to blame for evalu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular Shows of the BBC will give again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they perform rather the audience , and they can argue if they are going to perform their own sacred missions to the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ of broad@@ casts , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of window , in which no one she ever wanted to see .
to the spar@@ kling fee said Johnson said to the board : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can obtain the best value .
of course , you all think that you receive a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people that &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ every year , wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to form and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC @-@ production would now be formally classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV output and 0,1 % in the radio - and it should be interested in the publicly official TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown and with commercial Sen@@ ders alliances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control bra@@ in@@ cells by Schall@@ pl@@ ellen
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change direction at the moment in which it is radi@@ ated with Klang@@ impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by phr@@ ases of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which it with sound impul@@ ses , which have been heard for human hearing too high frequencies , in order to be radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und may be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of anti @-@ brain , a invasive procedure which gives electric impul@@ ses in the brain &apos;s brain to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fi@@ di@@ ver usually do not respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made clear that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und effects affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ ol@@ ders and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
sound waves carry the opening of these I@@ onian channels and activate the cells that are assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ o@@ des , edited Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ents carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he turns ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bes , and transfer into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on eur@@ on@@ ism .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientists allows the neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and switch off .
yet Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired job in the brain , low @-@ frequency ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und tissues may occur and can be sent in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the challenged human neur@@ ons temporarily to make the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ se@@ eded 19 @-@ year @-@ old , in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have become anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ win@@ ded complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the inaugur@@ ation in student dormit@@ ories varies from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to d@@ ying : people tell , where thou come from where you stand in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest , neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak if your eyelashes were in fire and that fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people get dressed and decor@@ ating their under@@ wear .
in this way , do not remember to catch the university with a relationship
Int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted gives a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , yet many students inhab@@ it a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ umm@@ el culture , which can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship gone on , but you have to go away to get the energy back for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ ing of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead .
speaking , Do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ determined door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
as you begin the university at the peak of back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ister is on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years , welcome to the neighborhood . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade delicacies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally , it depends if you are a decent B@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make that people as@@ le@@ ep up sleeping if you w@@ ow .
to ste@@ al food is a common crimes in student dormit@@ ories .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check the with the dairy property .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone goes off your things , the annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to handle it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise , the people from sleep or working out .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to men that are sitting in the glass building .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether they do something , Drum &amp; bass turns a little qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
she re@@ acted to even listen to older music .
when they finally heard at 5 am , she allowed her neighbors to sleep even two hours before she settled their own music , shut her door shut down and settled at her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would happen to be acci@@ dental into the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be deeply embarrassing for you to keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future married to get to her again , and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how to get all common friends overseas ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason to your base .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment in which you notice that somebody has its keys in his not realized room has lie , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing appears as it seems .
a good stretch is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
release by install@@ ments a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but have never ch@@ ew the room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close their door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you can then put into the free@@ zer - but give your poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice fixed .
town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ in@@ ers , t@@ ing@@ th@@ ers
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid @-@ fr@@ ischer Eck@@ ental Rei@@ g@@ stores for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother @-@ going mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how to build even today well and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project of ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or trainers has no sustainability .
because people remain a large part here .
in the face of the refugee stream we need adequate living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ day fri@@ ction @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a fri@@ ction @-@ house needs least number of space .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
that is different when people are living in living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project consists of three dwell@@ ings for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is located at 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took place .
this is appropriate .
have the rules for their plans a complicated process ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : construction @-@ right I used my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ema special design and the pitch @-@ space .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated who creates in a realm of three apartments , needs at least three places .
only in the cities is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents have re@@ acted to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were things which have thrown to me , luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely is not true .
but tigh@@ ten you not the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true it is true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years but they were hardly ever built .
my project has the message , also the normal human beings need shelter .
not only refugees , but also the only professional mother or the righteous .
I am showing how it is still cheap and well designed today .
that is why it is about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the activation app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allgem@@ ein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready to give you the telephone option to download and then install inst@@ aller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered problems after installing problems as they receive a error , which proves the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to deal with the problem is advised users either to wait until the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more likely to do this if you use a special tool using apps and then install them again as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update will continue , as the phone may possibly be swit@@ ched to half way and this could lead to a break@@ down of the updates .
continue : iOS 9 Release still in schedule despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in the review of iOS 9 : the least exciting , but the best update of iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone OS system
you should also make sure that you &apos;ve seen before your download our chec@@ klist of all things to prevent things going wrong and to protect themselves , in case they are tun@@ ed . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much cl@@ us@@ hing personal assistant and enormous new product features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
Nico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes @-@ Team@@ mate Lewis Hamilton just a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC @-@ wide stressed in front of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the Viz@@ e@@ world @-@ champion in front of the night @-@ champion in Singapore at this Sunday of Tit@@ le@@ def@@ ender and Two @-@ fold @-@ champion Hamilton .

whether the current sm@@ og in the city @-@ state will have an influence on the big price of Singapore is still unclear .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ markt Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft covered themselves under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new approach at the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consulting we can also take part in courses .
the social foundation makes it up from the mountain to the city center .
closer to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new quar@@ tered office .

therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic treatment .
the offers of the Sen@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , pension and re@@ hab .

witnesses demand the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , on 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , an 17 year old friend followed , followed by the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT gas station .
on the site of the gas station , three people also stopped .
one of these men now cri@@ ed the young men and struck this with the f@@ ist &apos;s face .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ legged break@@ down and ble@@ eding strong from the nose .
when his two friends were ex@@ trad@@ ed and established to the bats , he initially concluded from his sacrifice .
from his friends the last young man was brought to his home .
the perpet@@ rator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger up to their apartment and drove demonstrations several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was once again attacked by the r@@ acket and another male person .
under clar@@ ification of a stroke , one test on the face and the thig@@ h of the victim .
the last had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
until now , there is only one v@@ age tattoo .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second h@@ unters should have been about 1,@@ 65 meters in size and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practices , and invest@@ s in 310@@ 000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ic@@ in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z , and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside doctors are missing : As@@ endorf on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Hai@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring in the retirement , her husband left Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor in the next few months with a half point .
after a change phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 again , until then he will invest 310@@ 000 Euros at the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met who at present completed their professional education in the Ver@@ dener Hospital and also coming into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I was , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Couple , Müller fell the idea , in the future in As@@ endorf that has its own practice to operate .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he can see his own Chief soon .
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage dump the house with practice .
living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dium in Hanover , followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
at the moment he is working as a doctor &apos;s doctor in Sul@@ ingen , he was appointed to the leading emergency room in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ C &apos;s prepar@@ atory fr@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen was employed as the surgeon , his wife is specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to the Gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as hous@@ eb@@ in@@ aries .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the re@@ modeling the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ investigations as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ GS and need an intercom volume more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 euros , the waste within the scope of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) as well as by the Sam@@ t@@ gemeinde ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ communities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter in the practice field , in the northwest @-@ German speaking practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home office .
a positive side @-@ effects of the practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found she would have gone .
who visits the Expert Consult@@ ation by the way , continues to see above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical pract@@ ition@@ ers and the cleans@@ ing of the field of the field .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medic@@ s have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Field &apos;s bur@@ dock .
a little sad@@ ness feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and many patients will certainly see &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is comple@@ mented by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always been pressed for gardening , now this could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are driven also at our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said inter@@ minist@@ erial Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls at the Hungarian border in parallel to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to place a asylum order , that can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , also not about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia er@@ cis@@ ed &quot; Kor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously communicated , also Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany as well as under circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
in the very way that was the inter@@ govern@@ or Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia becomes rather the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
on the border with Croatia there is already strong control over the border of the Schengen period .
as the Minister said , Slovenia has thus not to wear its borders for refugees but not wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in East @-@ usa , at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to leave the registration .
the Croatian police could take it into the nearby dimensions of power .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days will host the country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be transferred to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ bian border that had so far been diver@@ ted to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade refers , however , that it may be that people should attack certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media outlets in the morning we report a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d , during the day more buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been around the entire night of the city &apos;s approximately 500 kilometers distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police have told us that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus , it could actually be a predicted shift to the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat more west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options on the border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country is preparing for the fall of a strong refu@@ ge by refugees appropriate plans for possible expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not say , but pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for the border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently called a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ish side we remain stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ um for about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media they would have spent the past night at the crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions of Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the refugees who wish to travel to Croatian border is still unclear .
Ser@@ bian Minister of the Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm one week at a local market place in Hor@@ g@@ os : he kept the debates about Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ghts of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at present to deal with very high refugee numbers .
one could not say if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers from migrants to - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
however , private Hungarian refugee centers have already begun to spread the refugees maps on which alternative routes in Croatia are marked .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia , there are still not eliminated min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ e@@ pers were sent in the border region .

therefore , this public @-@ effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wanted to communicate publicly to the tables , but be understandable , eventually it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and dying was still h@@ acked with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , has just had much contributed to the h@@ os@@ pice movement in recent years that people open .

Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the final quarter , and the delivery gig ensures his winn@@ ings on a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ at@@ oning service .
the company also said that she plans to visit some 5@@ 5,000 seasons for the holiday .
at that time last year Fed@@ Ex has announced that the Company would like to set 5@@ 0,000 lit@@ ers for the holiday period .
the share fell on 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is estimated that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher recei@@ pts and for growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; sound y@@ ields to take into account the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holidays employment were announced a day later than the ri@@ vals U@@ PS , that is planning , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 per cent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amo@@ unted to 2,42 EUR per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment Research question@@ ed anal@@ ysts .

Fed@@ Ex has taken a decline in the international pri@@ or@@ iti@@ an elec@@ trol@@ ymp@@ h in the last few years that took sales in his unit Express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express @-@ unit awarded higher recei@@ pts due to higher prices , while the result due to higher ones working in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they joined together with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ oni spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table meeting to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the lad@@ der .
Dro@@ h@@ end over them at an end of the complicated , two @-@ store@@ yed seat squ@@ als is located a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is remember@@ ing that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices down here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a cease @-@ standing third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate would be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight for them to say . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make more cau@@ ti@@ ous F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives , to increase these vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for Bundes@@ bonds - and it is also only a quarter percent@@ point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important of what they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ au &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been asked from Bloomberg Jo@@ in , have predicted that week these week are predicted .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless that Str@@ at@@ essen counters the strike , by promising that another increase is far removed .
on Tuesday j@@ umped from the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Sh@@ aver@@ s@@ worth around 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets into panic , so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a Zin@@ ser@@ um would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate in@@ security about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percent@@ ages this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the Mongo@@ lian conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , in spite of the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , that more than economic progress would be required , an increase in proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
unemployment rate sank into 5.@@ 1 % last month , the min for over seven years and near the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
Pay@@ ments have shown a sign of recovery .
and although inflation ran continuously under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can get higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world coinci@@ ded with the end of the last month , after China had upgraded its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Sh@@ aver@@ t was worth more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would be the global growth being sp@@ ros@@ y .
the market has recovered over this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation , when you increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy did not occur in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low said at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. Emer@@ gency .
now he predicted that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what will be the implications for the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is one of the main factors of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed can reach its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion , &quot; ext@@ ingu@@ ishes confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being pursued by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in other place , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , commented that month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ trac@@ tors to financial market movements , which apparently cannot be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , a united member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a fork @-@ height , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest around 0,75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite side @-@ recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives pulled this cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England .
the most recent turbul@@ ences are not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly wants not to be in the situation where they are afraid of a Zin@@ del , because markets were s@@ exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still does not contain double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe für Refu@@ ge@@ es
these days more and more refugees arrive in Germany .
you are welcome to prepare a warm welcome , not without the engagement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with Body and soul teaching .
even with their 74 lungs they are still taught .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
naturally teaching is quite different from being at the right school .
Brazi@@ li@@ ens p@@ ä@@ di@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to educate women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of paintings of babies , who are interested in br@@ ack@@ ets who are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , to give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers have come to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation to the cap should be made .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet therefore pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the municipality Bern@@ ried approved the construction site for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long ers@@ eh@@ n@@ ous turn@@ around in the amber area are taking step by step forward : in the recent council meeting was the un@@ worked construction project without great discussions .
before , the panel had decided among other things a request for a structural legal &quot; exception , &quot; accepted &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the exception of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form relating to the construction construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ gradu@@ ated first and attic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the planned use of the umbrella area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get a wonderfully large southern end , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in turn around the pit@@ falls , which should be pre @-@ written for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the Beb@@ au@@ ction plan with regard to the pit@@ falls did not apply &quot; exceptions - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der community is usually cru@@ ising rather restric@@ tive at the liberation .
the turn@@ hall@@ way is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; thus St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the Sports Center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ges .
at the cost around 2.3 million euros has been calculated .
grants are expected from training and long@@ itude .
the project application will be submitted for the 18 x 36 metres large hall for the landing stage for the 18 x 36 metres .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ght@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ j@@ berg hospital is intended to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Doctor Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ght@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this striking plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea Jeh@@ chner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the heads of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the h@@ unted on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action , all of the barely 50 employees would be working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ erk@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be en@@ rolled with fishermen and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , which cannot be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the beginning of the trial of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic , and now changes to a private practice in the direct vicinity of the hospital .
on the question of who the follow @-@ up was born , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who agreed to take charge of 1 October the management and to take with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au be@@ de@@ ute this in any case , an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evaluation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and wi@@ dening of the range in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; domestic medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardiovascular and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
over the next two years , fishermen leave with his team when the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will determine both houses , until then in the next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ enheim , which has more than 35 beds to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ j@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing reconstruction is completed at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chair@@ woman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , reported that the house , which is owned by the federal kn@@ apping , in future should be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner was not able to say , there are several reflec@@ tions .
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a diary @-@ based atri@@ cs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better we could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Fischer on the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mov@@ ing at the Le@@ ch , who had been thoroughly received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the home in which fishermen has been working as chief doctor for over 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closing times in the last decades , for example , the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the palms of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are now demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 5@@ pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favor@@ it , occasion for pre@@ tension however .
in the past season the bath at B@@ HC awarded a sore defeat and have a little ben@@ ign .
Jag@@ ie@@ fall with two se@@ pul@@ ling at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ kt@@ or@@ ers have been inju@@ red during their ma@@ is@@ ern@@ te on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the Aber@@ n@@ ome on a ma@@ is@@ feld at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ sberg Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , like the police .
after a qu@@ eue a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear .
the police force is determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence @-@ off@@ s
a Tat@@ t@@ agli@@ der has led the police on Lei@@ che , who has been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old took up , the young people killed and their cor@@ pse at a channel in rock@@ enhausen .
one since Saturday missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enhausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ution and police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ suspic@@ ious , one also applies to the service evening of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which indeed imp@@ lied the statement and the investig@@ ators for the discovery of the cor@@ pse led .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing in the Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve after a visit of a autumn in rock@@ enhausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first took on personal items of the sacrifice .
when question@@ ings in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing occurred eventually a Tat@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ in@@ arian offen@@ ders led the police into a channel in rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse has been found .
the mar@@ riages had followed the authorities in the police @-@ trial , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies were put into the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be demonstrated on Wednesday to the Chief tri@@ ck@@ le , the investig@@ ators put him Tot@@ us to the burden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instructions on the near@@ er circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warned of resi@@ dences
the situation on the German market market is tense .
more and more refugees seek a affordable place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing structure is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles at the German residential market have long started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the in@@ coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU increasingly push more people to a market which is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens in order to pay the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this outcome comes a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Soci@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
thus there are 14@@ 0,000 flats .
in the first three months of their stay , refugees have no longer oblig@@ ated to live as an asylum seeker in an initial examination .
many come across the residential market and went into the long sn@@ akes ahead of the rental apartments .
according to statistical Bundes@@ amt , however , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers are available for rent .
the negative development of the residential area , however , lies not only on the rising of the concentration camps .
this study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany shi@@ fts a housing deficit in front of which is greater from year to year .
currently in the metro@@ politan areas already approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units , l@@ aments Matthias Günther , author of the study .
so many of the working people stayed in large cities not@@ ched in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; the young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per head has dropped again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the coalition is propos@@ ing &quot; social housing , &quot; a new start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby new incentives to boost social housing and re @-@ boost &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the property tax could be disp@@ ens@@ ed and the property tax for funded apartments are exposed .
in addition , the alliance has been attractive tax @-@ free de@@ preci@@ ation .
the Förder@@ programm for Refu@@ ge@@ es at the State Bank K@@ f@@ W , comes from cities and villages already now .
a good week after the launch was launched in the evening with 184 million euros over half of the euro available at the same time .
the project could even be sto@@ cked up .
refugees have free yellow : Croatia and Slovenia create cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary practically no progress is coming and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ dles .
dangerous is the route nevertheless .
Croatia wants to travel across the neighboring country of Slovenia on setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the slo@@ ven@@ ian interior , and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Q@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country of Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ b@@ ish @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the borders at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which played in force on the same day , make an decent asylum process in Hungary nearly su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken its first refugees during the morning at the Ser@@ bian border to the EU in neighbouring Croatia .
the majority of media were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxi in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees did not go to Gren@@ ad@@ ä@@ une .
therefore , the border stri@@ pes other dangers are : there are sharp min@@ ors from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ en@@ räum@@ er will quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary after the closing of the border much more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police were 36@@ 6 connected people .
just before the tor@@ ch on Monday it was 93@@ 45@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fiers the overcoming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as a crime .
thus in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , we therefore have been introduced to 35 times of law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned thre@@ aten adhesi@@ on for up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday they have been compl@@ ained on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ car@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday that almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the hi@@ ps are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees dro@@ wned .
practically no one has more a view to get asylum in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after un@@ qualified view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
workers began to hire workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the gar@@ bage , the tens of thousands of people in the last weeks of the road .
Sper@@ or@@ gitter were dis@@ assembled and one of the entrance hall in the border town was rebuilt .
for the goal of this radical , nobody wanted to express themselves .
Austria is reaching only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants remained in the country but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people await the return trip to Germany .
the move from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German authorities .
in free@@ ass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met a regular basis .
Mayor , &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the flood@@ ing , when suddenly ten people were standing by stran@@ gers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said Wern@@ isch Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly busy on Sunday , because of the refugee stream in Austria , for them in Wern@@ stein , was the Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and put the bases along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we have the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once hung@@ est@@ ed , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow him to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro to the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stad@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , on Sunday evening in Wels , held from a ICE in a regional move towards Pass@@ au to move to the short notice , after the short notice , the road transport to Germany was dis@@ continued , but still trying to try the border .
the regional train was put down in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest connects with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday , tags in a two @-@ brid@@ led sport@@ y - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other tongues to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of working in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , at the establishment of structures , human@@ eness , our Chancellor , has officially built up , and publicly ent@@ ru@@ sted the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ lin of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing cha@@ otic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try must find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge in view of the sustained refugee currents and the nearby winter , in order to make decent ch@@ ats for protective seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will remain even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35.@@ 000 hi@@ ber@@ stur@@ dy Qu@@ arti@@ eren
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has full hands to do with the refugee movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up qu@@ arti@@ ers for the thousands of refugees .
finally , the chaos in the first @-@ centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria was without great hosts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interior ministers spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cro@@ ach@@ ful situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad with a demand for 8@@ 5,000 lod@@ g@@ ings in a h@@ ep@@ y year .
to meet the number , we need to find 35,@@ 000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 the bun@@ ches .
should it be more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted discussions with the provincial merch@@ ants .
these would have promised to it even for the coming refugees qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ings .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ en@@ born , it is said to be cle@@ ver@@ ted how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are given the asylum coordin@@ ator also into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the platform allows individuals to offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
moreover , one hopes to be at hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of need , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ ers have to keep a certain amount of to@@ wel @-@ holders or size of the sky@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be valid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , he was hu@@ gely successful in keeping with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , which one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er does not cause any costs , as they said themselves .
your employees want to raise it on three to four .
his own lod@@ g@@ ings was not yet successful .
finally , he wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
yet , there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary for the moment that people can currently supp@@ ress without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in case of emergency , further sites are to be tested for their ability .
the director of the chief reflects the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other areas must make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ unds are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday led the further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further voy@@ age of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special Rem@@ ov@@ als of refugees to Germany will not be there any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the sear@@ chers would be brought to Germany with regular intervals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger took a stronger solidarity in the refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria again lead us to its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the fields of technology .
&quot; in the IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
it can imagine , to invest in the start @-@ up firms of the New ship@@ yard and later also to be qui@@ valent .
from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1,7 million euros invested by S &amp; T to invest EUR 3.3 million from Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is taken from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it to requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Ark@@ ade
the new Shop is at the heart of fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jutta wanted to bro@@ aden a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old In@@ dic@@ ress of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ades : finally she has got its increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which it sells among others po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and threads of different manufacturers , are now all about d@@ resses hand@@ bags of the brand F@@ la , pur@@ ses are over 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
it has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ lay if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a private site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the her@@ it@@ ry in the Groß@@ raum Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has himself Italian roots .
your fashion @-@ interest has been ran@@ ked wide from her mother into the cradle .
thr@@ ust the most when something develops and I can show new trends at performance prices .
why so some women at sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ench@@ ant@@ ment , can also not answer the specialist &apos;s wife with the last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter aus K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose inhabitants are called an@@ am@@ pler .
this property also associated with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fication .
whether it expresses foreign policy , journalists aud@@ de or knowledge g@@ ass@@ ing in international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the US presidential office will be power@@ ing vigor@@ ously .
and das@@ hed well with them .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate is come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the wine street .
man@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants place is related over -@@ forty corners of him .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the electoral order mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned out a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his aim to become a mighty man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed at their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ers made , to which next to Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump who is not known for dest@@ in@@ arity , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement , that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he did not have it there .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ure the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; a big @-@ la@@ zy &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the Nickname &quot; name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in Hoch@@ deutsch , says she .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather had emig@@ rated and opened in the US a local restaurant for gol@@ d@@ fishes .
Grund@@ stein of the property concert were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from wearing : their desire to return to the country for a time , failed in the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was h@@ ew@@ ed without permission , had declared the Director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of the descendants .
it had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a limit wall to sc@@ out illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ tert , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote kin@@ dre@@ ary ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ egro@@ wer in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ setting . &quot;
believes he is coming out ?
&quot; I cannot imagine &quot; this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ess of Veronika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit to the church organ has ended , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call it better if he did not win the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when those who had the s@@ cars at the time of his grandfather in the US as he would , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film for which it was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gers , even in the US awak@@ ens the interest .
the Upper Bav@@ arian village of Ram@@ s@@ au at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the source of vice @-@ presi@@ dents at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ ennig , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the National Park of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden on Wednesday the award for soft tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ örfer . &quot;
in the neighboring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; may have no more than 2500 inhabitants .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s course to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the position of the liber@@ als , but it has won &apos;t have big ship@@ ments at the Reviews &apos;s Reviews .

this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for an Australian TV @-@ audience , since Sun@@ rise reached an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spect@@ ators with five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has concluded the gap of Sun@@ rise in the last few months .
in August today reached an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise stands on average 34@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at today .
this is the most interesting what has happened every morning .
the winds of change concern these hear@@ ers more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star by Prince to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recent lost father who closes , with his two children the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could contribute a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Fac@@ tor of Seven stayed strongly with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and suggested slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new tri@@ via show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ 6.000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped up to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on the Saturday evening , the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 viewers and in the second half hour
hot @-@ seat average of 6@@ 20.000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat is ultimately en@@ force at 5 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for Million Dollar per minute that didn &apos;t manage the Mc@@ Gui@@ res Show .

the last three are in line : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
how to be secret ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have kno@@ w@@ ingly obvious who the Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam wood in The Bachelor &apos;s finally , was wr@@ apped in the biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ loving girl will certainly not give cost if they received the one that has received the last rose .
but when we use Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows a day before coming out of three two , you may possibly have given a note to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the finals on Thursday sealed
all three women have lo@@ wer@@ ed themselves to l@@ yr@@ ic way of why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could your answers to the game b@@ ber be won , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki were both quick - except for himself - Mack@@ ay as best partner for wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood did a simple relationship from day one to another .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and re@@ marked the energies that I felt quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ an@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing by both feet on the earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with one another .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes they and Sam wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her perspective , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit did last week her clearly made that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the b@@ aked girl alike - it is a op@@ ted between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost a ger@@ angel like it was the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga with his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a bl@@ unt return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of putting his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly available in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special teams of special teams , who ri@@ pped him to forget his ar@@ pat@@ ched catch , and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was pat@@ ched in a p@@ unt which was restored in the first @-@ quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it certainly was not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ a for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne announced after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the game field and told later the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine worse start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that appears now , you just takes care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne discovered the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ üt then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free vot@@ er call for the high refugee numbers the h@@ iring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and fac@@ tional ef Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger war@@ ns to the start of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are many new students in front of a severe economic crisis : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get ver@@ if@@ ying in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ ers ends up to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Comm@@ une .
actually were quite different main topics .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum is conf@@ isc@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the former Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it does not go further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ab@@ gel@@ eh@@ nte asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the free vot@@ er as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this reason , Ai@@ w@@ anger also called more personnel for the administration , which are responsible for asylum authority : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the DM Chief critic@@ ized that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are nation@@ wide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern shi@@ fts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we have to act in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the state policy in a large @-@ wing city is not supposed to fall under the table .
a long long permanent pol@@ ishing bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the image policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) opened the pilot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intermediate step plus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um medi@@ ate can be tested for three to four years - in the result it will last nine years to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be acceler@@ ated , &quot; said the FW body .
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ es who want to .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations in order to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ driven campaign that will help the thousands of refugees to help the thousands of refugees trying to over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from the war of cr@@ ashes and armed countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the donation of donations from his blog .
instead of letting a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who has escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our trip belonged many dark railway and bus cru@@ ises , as well hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate .
the donations go to four charitable organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally active donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the years of civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees also fled from the war of Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight di@@ ab@@ etics may be beneficial effects .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people living with diabetes in weight surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years there have been proven adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and stomach @-@ speci@@ ation - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who subjected itself to this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went out a surgical procedure , implants in 36 % the diabetes condition totally and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ medical group of patients , diabetes also solved only one percent and partially in only about two percent .
in addition , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also over@@ cast the patient blood levels by hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery the average ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to approximately 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading scientists Dr chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ ably average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more likely a complete exit of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery has lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was with@@ ett@@ led people who under@@ went to an obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study had no benefit for survival during surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone imp@@ lied that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accum@@ ulated this genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story takes place at H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East must lie .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which dedicated to ethics research .
in the given circumstances , he called for the interests of humanity to be placed against the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to get engaged in managing the crisis , he empha@@ sized that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that violent reaction from the US moved a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 I have put my ac@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from taking hand inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ic@@ ation centers in the United States report about nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years that are greatly alcoholic drinks inf@@ ect@@ ant , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , wins the cases of revenues of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years old , the tox@@ icity centers , reported from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go into practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE on social media .
watch videos on YouTube , such as adolesc@@ ents dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have sup@@ pos@@ edly mixed with dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ ected .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ ling , grapes and orange pe@@ ers , which are very appealing to children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in children @-@ children can already lead few sy@@ ringe to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the gre@@ ek centre in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let m@@ ck whis@@ ky to stand around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from the stra@@ wberry @-@ inf@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school was taken into an emergency response .
their blood of blood @-@ mare was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that goes by law to an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , which acted in the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go as she came into practice .
doctors survi@@ vor@@ s them overnight in a separate chil@@ dish hospital in signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had the head crossed off , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ins and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after the end of hand inf@@ ecting crane , which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient .

de Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights in the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ranking is not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the leader@@ boards .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

why I will be a companion of an expedition in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the de@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p will be executed by the po@@ ison@@ er .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already made for the first time in January of his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked , I was talking .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the United States , and there are often more applic@@ ants than places available , there is a ma@@ ke@@ eper lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media fields from 12 to five .
who is selected who will observe it emotional .
I cannot do that .
in addition to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps I will sit with my own relationship over the months with tel@@ eph@@ ones and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to bring a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma calls me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants and you get access .
I agree with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have put better artic@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong with what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I would not do it if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ tile of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a deadly death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can contact for this .
what you will get of me is what it means to die for a man &apos;s unnecessary death .

the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday to a cross @-@ slope incident in Beck@@ enh@@ am .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards finished , ex@@ ert him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install and dro@@ pping a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the year to immediately stop the race .
he went on the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ r@@ ite section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ di@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult circumstances , when it was to be the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept up 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age pro@@ w@@ ling and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have long spoken to it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there are further .
sometimes you have re@@ acted , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to move about by the main ones and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be more co@@ aches .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before had Moo@@ dy replaced the bom@@ b into an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integ@@ r@@ ite Department has tried to st@@ oning his co@@ w@@ shed .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables for giving information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they attempt to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , ehem . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ der , am@@ acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L were aware of the time and are still alive today .
should I bring that to the opinion , that it is personally ?
has the RV@@ L engaged itself and is perhaps people outside of Train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the sector ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and come to me , and I have no doubt that what I say to it now lets me think about it now .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have established themselves with the long @-@ lasting in@@ alt @-@ examination of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could say &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for the preparation of the master Master Masters , signed the racing Sunday treatment rule , &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack mud or sound was applied to the horse @-@ debate , which is hidden against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has been er@@ ron@@ eous mud on the leg .
it could have been there yesterday evening .
it could have been all day yesterday , so what was like that .
but it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the racing day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who pose these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for asser@@ tions to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy makes criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two prime League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator lists the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in the qualifying @-@ final in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a bad envel@@ ope with the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample set &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland is not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy who defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ i of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team give him confident , because it de@@ cri@@ bes that they were worried about the Storm team be@@ aten to be be@@ aten .
&quot; that appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson over Ring@@ fights spoke , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing at our blu@@ ish system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles to a real centre , and this has been done for us at the turn .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a little shock for him .
it is funny as this always appears again at that time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy Ben@@ nett has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded that Ben@@ net St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he was compared to his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was critic@@ ised as a bo@@ red team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ reds of it .
but now he has a team who can play and see it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the b@@ allet that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these .
I have increased confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably had not thought of us when it was around the big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster had a higher result achieved than the bronze against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make points a bit stretching ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
if they mention us it means that we will meet in a phase even more .
the Storm team has at this weekend free as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the First Saturday at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ Cau@@ tion to Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who may possibly a lifetime punishment threat@@ ens because of its being , to be owned by 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine who have been sh@@ ou@@ ted to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the Dro@@ ge on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and presented in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused of the marina in the early mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police were 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly lifetime punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that it didn &apos;t give evidence that he tried to possess the whole multitude , and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has left the police on his position in the prosec@@ ution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of $ 200,000 for security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the casual explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge F@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to keep it from it , not to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , met with the police daily and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cells are decent
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel in the Te@@ gel , which was for a small cell contained in one to small cell .
because of the infrin@@ gement of their lives , prisoners tend to be entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells .
this has decided on the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht in a decision on Wednesday .
the persons concerned may even hope to pass on the judges , even if only a few days they were imprison@@ ed within the too narrow rooms ( AZ . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prison@@ er was successful in Karlsruhe : he was successfully housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spatial non @-@ separated .
after that , the man , who is again on free walking according to his law , has been moved into a larger cell .
his counter@@ part conditions due to the un@@ worthy adhesi@@ on conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitu@@ tional Jud@@ gement took the jud@@ gement of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and referred to the case for renewed testing .
they see the human dignity of man inju@@ red .
Kammer@@ ger@@ ich will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons the frag@@ ile period just a few days of the port of compensation for the compensation was decisive , it meant to be an equ@@ alization .
otherwise , &quot; a short@@ cut of the legal nature of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al has now to be clar@@ ified to the amount of dental damage .
the Constitu@@ tional govern@@ ors have often strengthened the rights of pris@@ ons in the past .
so they said only in April of a prison@@ er &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant , because it was imprison@@ ed in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also according to the multi@@ level of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which had an in@@ less accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ ation in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines for the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore again enclosed again 23 hours , which sever@@ ity himself , due to the tense situation there have been .
according to information on the Just@@ iz@@ press@@ est@@ elle are 21 places in Te@@ gel because of rep@@ lic@@ it angels not occupied , 19 shall fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to take them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absor@@ b a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say &quot; again and again : we can create this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
searches for different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all at affordable rental : annually ( 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 welfare apartments from the lease ) and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will apply for refugees too .
Bundes@@ minist@@ erin Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion of double , at least 518 million at one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ el Institute ; 80 thousand social housing per year would have to develop and for that the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
the scientists and Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for labour market research and occupational research , 55 percent of the refugee fighters in Germany can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked at all about their qualification to help them start getting started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they find jobs in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording group , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says migration researcher Diet@@ rich th@@ än@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , it has given a political change to the throne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a political turn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the service offered to refugees for recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while earlier a working @-@ ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years had been reduced , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dual light , the asylum seek@@ ers to a location is restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour , a majority of view means that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is still no right choice of general and occupational @-@ related language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often shared by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore accompanied by th@@ ri@@ b@@ th@@ end@@ or of the royal way to the employment integration .
the Berlin school administration has stated that only a few refugees receive their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent , &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ libr@@ arian , Spe@@ aker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of Hand@@ ett@@ el in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators to rise strongly influenced by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - by adding more technical schools .
in the countries students are being prepared without a German knowledge of welcome - Welcome to the instruction .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack ; Beate St@@ suit@@ case says of the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or commemor@@ ated the study - the only exception was to Berlin , In@@ cl@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
study @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university .
for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement , or tent@@ et do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ ers law , if they begin graduate studies .
the latter generally will not get a BA@@ Fö@@ G because it does not fall under the circle of the pu@@ pi@@ per person .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten these br@@ aces at 15 months .
but this financing , however , must be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins , State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should un@@ tie the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches have the right to develop a new state @-@ religions .
important would also be the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights also belong duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must be clear and prepared to cooperate with the state in many respects and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes willingness to he@@ ap against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be reached in Germany .
those who want to bring such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he suggested using the Basic Law on Arabic .
in future integration will be much more than today a topic of society .
this will also have to change the majority of surplus @-@ society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination decade and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes very slow , like the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie , the police and authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and the stak@@ eholder groups are demanding for a long time , and to commit to international agreements as anti @-@ racial corporations in Germany , must stay calm in the next few years if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to provide healthcare medic@@ ally , the u@@ est@@ ry for therap@@ ists Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there will be some extra money to flow into the system .
to avoid the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all renew@@ als are immediately shipped in the registration of the health cards .
brought services could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the restricted performance catalog to see the asylum application Act .
otherwise , they make the doctors especially to create the language barriers .
in the past so far , the Berlin health scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be more un@@ solved by their disease as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical pract@@ itioner needs interpre@@ ter costs , they require .
this would be helped many refugees too , but also with more general medical records in the emergency surgery .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee centres , approximately there are much more un@@ organized disabilities , and in the young people go about HIV @-@ clar@@ ification .
with the partial other cases of disease , German doctors think about their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ it@@ enbe@@ ck or Tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and in terms of anger , be dimin@@ ished by the refugees or even in sight .
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , et@@ able refugees or even doctors .
in order to practice it , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and have to take examination once again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany to come , according to the bund@@ ling therap@@ ist Psych@@ otherapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is ill : most of them suffer from an post traum@@ atic exposure to or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; specially vulnerable to vote , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of the Technical University of Munich proves that every twenty @-@ fifth refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post traum@@ atic exposure to a post traum@@ atic exposure , it suff@@ ers from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death scar@@ es .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ating disorders , strong neg@@ ativity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to avoid that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , stated amm@@ z .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
while psych@@ isch @-@ sick asylum seek@@ ers can present an application for Psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months to process .
in addition , in the welfare of workers mostly experts or doctors who are not trained for the psychological disorders , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family .
so the gift to am@@ aze the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their day @-@ to @-@ day and take it for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; junior staff &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ tails with world city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ air , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour , this fl@@ air can now be experienced .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international Cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family moved the audience with w@@ it and charm in her b@@ ann .
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the st@@ umm@@ ings it wants to receive the Cub@@ an duo .

60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal rights groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes place : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go well to our animals , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called lov@@ ingly , will be read after the possibility of any wish of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel not at ease , it does not want to go into the sle@@ ek .
so , the su@@ preme commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ te , the family is pro@@ ud@@ ly proud .
the two animals have lived up eight years in a pen and nothing is happening .
&quot; but suddenly , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the cir@@ cus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there is likely to be something for every visitor .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holding wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ äl@@ zer leader , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also fail@@ ing by members of the opposition to obtain anonymous death penalty and warned them to accompany the talk of Mr Mu@@ gabe with bug .
last month she bu@@ ked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS messages they have received on their phones they warned Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ alogue .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warned the parliamentary members that the imm@@ unity in parliament ends and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chief Executive Officer said the Party of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , be &quot; worried about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will later be split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job creation leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , he said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unity of separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is being smaller and stronger than it &apos;s HP today and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing an un@@ att@@ ained , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
there is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to manufacture electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has run a massive restructuring to tackle the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
little stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after the plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate dum@@ plings , and then again found to its old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well cur@@ led .
this is not a major concern .
it was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with its buttons , or with the injury he had previously had .
this may be true of purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , whenever a player is trying to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd , 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ y 157 Lig@@ ue in the last five times .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have reported most vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the accus@@ ation rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win war@@ fare , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deser@@ ved .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am hot@@ sp@@ ur on the coming Wednesday , and turning out to a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta starts .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to break a small break @-@ off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ sen@@ al clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the greatest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was tor@@ tured on Tuesday evening by an earthquake which were measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al the apprentic@@ eship has drawn from the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and remains of far hope to lead the association with its management to its first European Parliament Triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Impulse is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , who gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now still un@@ question@@ able than ever before , such as self @-@ mur@@ dered amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important death toll in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ico ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ al life ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of bringing the culture into question , the men are hin@@ der to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms made firm that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery is dist@@ ressed .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends produces the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends with that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media @-@ led communication , with its emphasis on style on substance , the in@@ deli@@ ver@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaning@@ less contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , lively and successful , dou@@ bles , even if in reality the isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy it .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , made by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they often fall back , fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the telephone call it said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ mur@@ dered , I really clearly showed me how the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term outdoor mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men @-@ friend@@ ships .
so much of my objective out@@ si@@ zing status on the phone the person in moments of despair may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you are visiting this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and tell you hello .
you never know what kind of friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to destroy Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and ends PSG to launch on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game @-@ report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani retained course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday starting .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards it missed a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball@@ er achieved .
with Real Madrid and Sh@@ ei@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs to start a strong start against the Swedish master as they didn &apos;t only seek the qualification for the N.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement in the way to quarters in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to gain 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to b@@ ade in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet made one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his breach in one of three changes to the Paris team which could last on weekends a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces at their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was b@@ apti@@ zed in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wings was considered to be the man to take the PSG to the next stage in Europe , and he clar@@ ified on why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence before he completed Johan Wil@@ and passed pretty into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PSG would win a great win , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off sco@@ red to reach this level , occurred at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nationalities in the field and was ran@@ ked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field pic@@ tured a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which went far to Kevin Tr@@ aps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , put them little in the attack .
instead , I felt sometimes on , with some mis@@ ways and poor degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had deployed him after the rest@@ art .
nevertheless , he pointed a lot more creatures , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a fil@@ ming turned , which was drawn from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay sco@@ op@@ ed his six@@ ty Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a le@@ ft@@ ist f@@ ist of Max@@ well .
this ended up all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before sub@@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end .
the Trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later a class of his team played , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hut from front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to deal with the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is be@@ aten from her white border .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , for the direction of direction to the movie . Dam@@ on inv@@ aded that their direc@@ ting &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ res before dis@@ appro@@ vals on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .

the competition show , which ended up their 7th season , had never experienced a contest @-@ participants that could conclude all levels of his obstacle course .
during seasonal fluctu@@ ations there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
k@@ icks ended the task within the time , which he completed the first ath@@ l@@ ete which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge in full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner .

&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or as life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile &apos;s money .
so very suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why k@@ icks , although it ended the course at all the course , not just your prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit tiger .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , this part played on Tuesday perfect against the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins had a chance for Ascension within a play@@ time of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad stands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support , as the Detroit formed three times in the first two minds , then once in the sixth and then once more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made it possible for three branches .
it was only his third @-@ successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of every game , and therefore I want to fully concentrate in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ man hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has well cur@@ ved the drums , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the bull ( percussion ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ pen , and he carried it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh Internal , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a m@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy covered wall , the only man who was confronted with which he con@@ fron@@ ts , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who has entr@@ en@@ ed a two @-@ run by the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the end @-@ run on the second did Ver@@ hagen den third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a Double Play .
it was this in the Major League &apos;s premi@@ ère December 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe will be equipped with Double Play
after Detroit added at the end of the ninth intro@@ duc@@ ting Insurance , , the wall creates a R@@ BI &apos;s double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ do and obtained the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed st@@ ach however , however , has three pitches on three pitches for its fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game of a still not ov@@ able Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three branches in the first two intro@@ duc@@ tions against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been del@@ ayed before the game from the off@@ ending list , after having been missing for a back in over a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to call , &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; but I felt confident when I felt loose and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pitches on the third inning . &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man , h@@ iring gave a single turn on Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , managed to create another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third what the threat was ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed on the second , made a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not have be@@ aten very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ ghes was in a Pit@@ ch count@@ down , generated no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the Rel@@ ative right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s .
at Hu@@ ghes she came to three branches with six hits and a walk with four car@@ ke@@ outs .

his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the respective subjects may well be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he made a subjective an artistic selection of the many topics of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; books of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cycles were cycles , which devote topics like Kreu@@ zwe@@ g , Pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
with this , he was spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and that is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective be@@ ware .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible selected from Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into the Today , in ongoing inter@@ relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ale mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between Martin Luther from the original Bible from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the cas@@ cade of gold has Golden Let@@ ters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
it is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately born at all trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who raised the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Or@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education has already happened with the tube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work , to maybe work with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ define the art in fast @-@ time period : &quot; the perception of image wels is marked today by Re@@ cl@@ ame and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is going out there .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ator go into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , who has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like he is able to make life with his paintings . &quot;
I have not desp@@ ised the Bible completely , but that is chosen for him important , including mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely describes it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; written &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Bilder speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - pap@@ ay@@ - and can@@ ear@@ images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn nah@@ t
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
om@@ issions in politics and administration , especially in the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
so hill shi@@ el@@ ded to take new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , the first congreg@@ ation in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been sent to the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year has not yet happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former Hall@@ enb@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign in the weekend .
football is responding to the foot@@ ing situation in Germany and as@@ sures the policies of its help with the problems of the coming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider that the biggest challenge for our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in dealing every individual to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet there the leadership of Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can help and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be the policies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football Association therefore has donated his refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine represent a clear sign , when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship document ( her@@ mes ) the expression &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Leverkusen , chef Rudi Völ@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and said the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is every one allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can state football Federation , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fier game against Hungary this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Saale
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach identified the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences had in their places have started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest ver@@ ry are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent , will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year the association will work with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government at 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they already called for the whole amount for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP pre @-@ stand@@ ings loses an eye in an accident
the head of the head of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported several reports , according to a fall in early July the left eye is lost .
in the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA it was after midnight fell to a water @-@ glass he carried in the left hand , the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is unbelievable , it was impot@@ ent , then turned out to@@ wed out onto the road - which he told us so last week , &quot; quot@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could prove his work .
&quot; beginning of October we meet before the supervis@@ ory board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s award ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in a regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and its chairman of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that something can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you really fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except free@@ zing ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te an ev@@ ax@@ le photo and explained , he caused the injury to be drag@@ ged from the wheel .
he therefore comes at night in Singapore at weekends as well as reservations for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button In@@ query , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund , all hopes were definitive for a com@@ eback by Marco re@@ us in the first group game of Europe League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 07 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot go back to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether in the Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Leverkusen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach allowed us to be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high loading of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will change its regular eleven not only on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door @-@ position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ oun@@ ter takes place in the place of tri@@ bal Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether past@@ oring in future in all the Europa @-@ league games , tu@@ chel left however open .
by high probability he will also tie the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the acceler@@ ation statement from co @-@ players re@@ us that the fin@@ al@@ locate for BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the target of mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the leadership for Germany
Germany shall at the end of the German government for the change of the car technological pioneer .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic Paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the fair I@@ AA by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected car will increase traffic safety and ensure less steel , &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry in the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport sets , among other things , emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band and an additional level of ascent on digital list@@ ings .
the testing of new technology is currently being created a track track on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; intends to review the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary , adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Germany seeks to employ around an international level that the permitted maximum speed of more self @-@ driving cars will be raised by 10 to 130 hours .
the Federal Government will also opt for a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far been presented to people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to one of the study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible on motor@@ ways to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are not expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in the location of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the pump can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the drivers were clearly clar@@ ified .
however , the German self @-@ driving cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test Dec@@ or@@ ization Dec@@ ra comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that the autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent anticip@@ ate that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in case the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a collection of the digital network , Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would be appro@@ ached , control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway , this could result in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
almost everyone was allowed to leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and @-@ start at Tis@@ cht@@ en@@ nis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will take place in the intro@@ duc@@ tory stand at the Tit@@ le , from 25 September to 4 October only in single .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ms Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer as a clear Favor@@ ite , &quot; explained single @-@ action Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the s@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ statt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo was missing , and we are Europ@@ am@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , we should be guided , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the outer lists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer team of Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right foot .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a En@@ f@@ ant y
it is a combination of very great mo@@ den@@ schau and a qu@@ or@@ ly sco@@ t : the designer Jean Paul Gaulle tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ quin , which are striking of the video proj@@ ections .
they contribute to the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the mo@@ ck scene - and with it that he put it into na@@ cke .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant y the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was not easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said de Gaulle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle closed by the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed his first @-@ year attitude toward a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been against it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had already made the Canadian Montreal and Paris station before .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion history has written without ever getting a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es overall artwork , for which much effort was running : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material made the makers after details of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gaul@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ qu@@ itted mo@@ vi@@ be of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he was attracted his Ted@@ dy Bear and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
playing with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the design of fashion he later brought himself to himself .
he st@@ ole fashion @-@ magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought the course of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the model .
they got nothing , they were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machinery in and around enough to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and peaks emerged in great multitude for customers , for example they worked for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip played a greater role , then pushed by the textile industry - and now is re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional trac@@ tions .
at all picture the so @-@ called vintage mode , which hing@@ es on past stit@@ ches , an increase of contract .
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany are no longer available on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ ys together with nine other companies are a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s top and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of the revenues were broken .
private specialist and the wholes@@ aler , there is almost no more .
our products can hardly reach customers in this way .
the mass ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian area and are distributed almost exclusively via chains .
furthermore , de@@ bil@@ le of export , currently in Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to explain precisely through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the nit@@ rogen ox@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we are leading a quality si@@ e@@ gel that shows that we can produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ a designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ Se@@ eberger from the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and peaks .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varying in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile design designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter is new of the historic snow @-@ top .
send the machine at some places small kitchen .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ ress was inspired in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ cks : &quot; before I could not start anything with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the Snow@@ fl@@ point for their jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially in their customers whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who wish to mem@@ info of mem@@ or@@ ab@@ ilia .
in this way I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney Plan@@ ned new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends should not cry , but Disney still stands up to a new film of his classic . Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; however , it is not about new fil@@ tering but a kind of continuation , which 20 years after the first film plays with the mag@@ ici@@ an kids .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the Banks in Time of the financial crisis in England .
who will play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already clear : Rob Marshall , last but with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; at the cinema .
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open itself wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group which was commissioned with the ste@@ ering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should work to boost foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address with the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ funds promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said .
the leadership group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to the regulation of the market , complete relaxation , border controls ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of melan@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a greater role in the resources of resources , ensuring a legally state business environment and design the market open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls across the powers transferred to the powers and make sure that companies decide how they perform their operations .
the Statement also stated that China will allow the border areas to explore new models of trans@@ national economic governance and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state controlled sectors , further areas will be opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants double to double mer@@ cury border in rob@@ ber@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits of mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve practice .
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who is in front of an attractive working group of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans cris@@ p : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are forwar@@ ded with full weight and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to be the limits of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of one on two milli@@ gram of Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
great rap@@ tors have already been so strongly deb@@ ited today with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still valid border limits , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not being sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limits values then only 14.@@ 5 percent is negoti@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU is aiming to tigh@@ ten the limits on other fish@@ eries limits on other fish@@ ings of around 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
food@@ watch drew this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemetery , such as car@@ riages are mostly so low , that they already hold the planned down@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sen@@ ing in mon@@ ish is therefore &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ fi@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that helps only the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a very @-@ toxic heavy metals that strongly adap@@ ts itself across the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts of particularly in the n@@ atives of the nervous system can cause . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains its homepage with regard to the current figures , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; to the general population is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal @-@ burning in the environment .
the German co@@ coal power plants , according to a written request from the Federal Ministry of German Bundestag , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is more than six tonnes of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , &quot; permanently and super@@ ficial over@@ flow , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had cited its paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings found before Mercury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
