the BIS could close Stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if banks constitute an appropriate application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total cost of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion billing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of the membership fees of the member countries .
some terms are already mentioned , however , to whose application the BIS would be ready .
at any stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially take up a commitment to two years , with the possibility of extensions , without being exceeded five years .
for the opening of the loans , as well as the extension extension , the BIS would charge a credit @-@ open vision .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw is not made prior to completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , that the bank may carry the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the draw would be made available in the BIS at the agreement of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time periods that would be taking into account the means of the bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those that comply with the BIS at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would be largely equivalent to market positions .
if the BIS must have the necessary funds in the market , then the rate of interest rate could reach a maximum , which is equivalent to a corresponding margin of the Libor .
I would be thank@@ ful if you would like to tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

a recur@@ rence to blood @-@ determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the An@@ tigen , the antibodies or another on the label ( substance hom@@ olo@@ g ) .
if a recur@@ rence in which are used by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena can not appear : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by always re@@ lu@@ te the re@@ lu@@ te of the recur@@ rent re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es on the double in a suitable medium .
the title is the recur@@ ren@@ al value of the number of dil@@ uted ser@@ di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution shall be charged exclusively in volume of blood cells in total volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which should be used in objec@@ tions , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood @-@ determination international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are currently being processed .
an international standard pre@@ set contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is ir@@ respective of the titles that are observed in individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to blood @-@ level determination of most speci@@ f@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tial , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents to blood @-@ determination , for the International standard perio@@ dic@@ ate ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of unknown reag@@ ents in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if one brings them back to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B are equivalent according to the definition of 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are free of charge of the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ements Serum Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative version of the International standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer , so its required features will remain at least one year long .
the expi@@ ration date of a recur@@ rence in flu@@ ori@@ fic form is up to a maximum of one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
this is applied on the label pre@@ exp@@ iry date for dry conditions ; it depends on the results of the holding tests ; it is appro@@ ve from the state supervisory authorities .
dry reag@@ ents are kept in an atmosphere of infected gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , where it has been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry re@@ acted must lose at most 0.5 of its weight if it is tested by more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg for a pressure of less than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or to be added with the dry conditions delivered ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic , as long as the recur@@ rence with the added substance continue to improve conditions of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin to blood @-@ determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml , or re@@ dissolved server .
the reag@@ ents , nevertheless , whether in flu@@ ori@@ fic form or after re@@ plen@@ ishment , must be transparent and may not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
those responsible for the international exchange in particular reag@@ ents to blood @-@ determination should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least as long as an international agreement has come about a unified system .
reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group determination are found in such ways and in such quantities that this is not only enough to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to conduct tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy of efficacy in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ laboratory @-@ laboratory has to lead over all production stages and controls of reag@@ ents to blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all the reag@@ ents are so long lasting from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents for blood @-@ determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and conservation of stability .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each single container is a black @-@ printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the fluid required liquid ,
in addition , this label or the label is on the cardboard box where the single containers are located , or to contain the containers included the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the quantity or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the fluid required liquid ,
each broadcast is a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the Protocol to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of the group B , which can be immune to red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A immune .
anti @-@ A serum @-@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is dissolved in parallel to the back , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard presence of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ at separated against A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur in any re@@ lu@@ sion within the double time that is required if the same attempt is carried out with the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard pre@@ set of equal bi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of the group A , which can be immune to red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is dissolved in parallel to the back , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ at against a flow of B @-@ blood cells .
if Anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent increase in the double time , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double time that is needed when the same attempt is carried out with the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ology or with a standard pre@@ set of equal bi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is derived from the blood of selected persons of the group 0 , which can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of the group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B group , i.e. the sub @-@ groups A and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ eal not contain human red blood cells , which contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ eal human red blood cells that contain A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ ined in general by anti @-@ A serum from the group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is dissolved in parallel to the back , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard presence of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group ser@@ ology or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ at , separated from A1 to A2 blood cells .
it is also parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ at against a flow of B @-@ blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum is also an easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum on an object carrier with the same amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent increase , the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur within a double time that is needed when the same tests performed with the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard pre@@ set of equal activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum for an object carrier with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent are bl@@ ending in a double time that is necessary , if the same attempt is dissolved , but in@@ inn@@ ate International standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ ums or a standard pre@@ set of equal bi@@ dity is performed .
if an anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same quantity of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent increase in blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the pre@@ conditions in which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle cal@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers also bear hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are tra@@ pped in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements relating to the effectiveness of Sera for determining the R@@ h Group may possibly be changing if International standard rates are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ized by the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells , which do not contain the an@@ tigen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a title of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is to be dissolved in parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted international standard unit of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ ate to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , the serum is intended to act with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , which are intended for use of object dreams according to the Test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be full within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely covered within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogenic C of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it acts with the flooded human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not contain human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Sera are therefore specific to the C @-@ An@@ tigen , only if the tested blood cells are w@@ asted in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ dee &apos;s blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Sera that are intended for use in object dreams according to the Test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be used directly from the blood of immun@@ isation persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
both antibodies must be effective at the same time in a given serum conditions .
a serum for use on object dreams according to the Test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son is intended to show the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction not lower than in the ant@@ enn@@ as antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals , which can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A immune system .
anti @-@ A serum @-@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there is no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a corresponding compar@@ ing unit , separated with a depth of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur in any re@@ lu@@ sion within the double time that is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard presence of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a standard pre@@ set of equal bi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is derived from the blood of animals , which can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which means B @-@ an@@ tigen , that means those of the blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , that is called those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ing unit , with a flow of blood cells of the group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) .
if Anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent increase in the double time , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double time that is needed if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard pre@@ set of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group ser@@ ology or with a standard pre@@ set of equal avi@@ dity .
