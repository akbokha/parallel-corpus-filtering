it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to insert ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ings ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological illness in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods abnormal ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe almond episodes and to the prevention of lack of episodes in patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for quick control of gest@@ ed ag@@ itation or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients , which prepar@@ es the swal@@ low of tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells below each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ ion &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less much more than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter seems to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , contributes to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and re@@ inst@@ ances .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by one year .
the efficacy of injection @-@ solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was tested in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body add the melting tablets and the solution to the entry ( takes up ) .
in the two trials with injection solution showed the patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms as the patient who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ure symptoms as placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented several times more effective than placebo to perform several episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo had increased symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( nausea ) , nausea , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , ru@@ th@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ serious to severe episodes in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes , and with which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , opposed the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection @-@ solution in rapid control of gest@@ ed ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ take the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the return of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
an increased efficiency of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
looking at the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors justify that ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder were not an elevated su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency , hyper@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ er ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , it should be drawn into consideration that reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene should be applied to patients with var@@ ic@@ ity in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are associated with var@@ ic@@ ity in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer feeding , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients treated with direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which is known as side effects as side @-@ effect , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized medicines such as sea @-@ en@@ coding ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers an ultra @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism can result in higher plasma inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ as before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene had no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zene ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to in@@ sufficient data base to safety in humans and due to the intervention trials in the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long term study of 52 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ eine and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in a different controlled long term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study on 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was observed in patients under the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that have been reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any death sequence .
there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ; it is unlikely that her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit is that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene has a high plasma connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder with the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and an excessive aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ones Emission @-@ tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ing @-@ depend@@ ant reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ sch .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ controlled study 52 the proportion of respon@@ sive patients who contribute to study medi@@ ation was similar to the study drug in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery as@@ berg@@ - depression , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in return rates , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational dual @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 25 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effectiveness compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two Plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a significant efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to lithium or semi @-@ medicine in week 12 .
also , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed 12 a comparable share in patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ or or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing the reduction in the reduction of medical symptoms compared to mono@@ therapies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase on a stabil@@ isation period prior to Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a re@@ mission compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a set@@ back into the man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , op@@ ener patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ular @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoke based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose trial in subjects with different cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , but the study involved only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw keys on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with re@@ peti@@ tive gift , reproductive fibre , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and a can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .

in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the failure of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were detected in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of the monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro @-@ solu@@ bility .

97 In a placebo controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to feed at 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Exceptional A chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the damages of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injec@@ tor should be termin@@ ated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the resp@@ i@@ bility and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended using adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be used depending on the individual clinical status which is already taken into account or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a more advanced treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to insert .
there are no investigation on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injec@@ tions in patients with ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ az@@ ep@@ ine should be considered necessary , the patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injec@@ tion@@ solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( caused or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency , hyper@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ er ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which is known as side effects as side @-@ effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , intensity of se@@ d@@ ole was greater compared to the sole propriet@@ or of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a disposable intra@@ muscular ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism can result in a higher plasma inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ as before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular , was the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation greater compared to the sole propriet@@ or of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral @-@ related medical side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study on 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness / behavi@@ ours compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms associated with regard to the toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ sts , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but statistical significance could be determined due to a dimin@@ ished patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a semi @-@ controlled study 52 the proportion of respon@@ sive patients who had a response to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in return rates , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 25 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of six weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing the reduction in the reduction of medical symptoms compared to mono@@ therapies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of lack of patients who had reached a re@@ mission in a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed superior to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a set@@ back into the man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene AU@@ C is greater in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two forms .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plas@@ mas@@ king at 1 @-@ 3 hours after application .

the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole propriet@@ or or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
consider only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy and survival between pharmac@@ euticals and progression .
in contrast , in patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients , breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ kers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not contained in patients where the first treatment was no longer required , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines was not given to other medicines containing other medicines to decrease side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a permit for the office of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ enia number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
when sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 is to break down , until a improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with affect ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data for recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use of children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to be infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nano @-@ particle form@@ ul@@ ating from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features as other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be treated once again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ rop@@ athy has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas in connection with abra@@ sives in connection with car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , kar@@ di@@ al inci@@ dents did not have been un@@ usually unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or genital heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients according to the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these can be treated with the common anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ zing funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant or women in the aged age , which do not practice an effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible .
women in the aged age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised during and up to six months after the treatment not a child .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ mon due to therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and dizziness ( often ) , which can influence on traffic jams and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( with 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ ing ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 , the adverse events listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lact@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated hem@@ at@@ inine in the blood , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ spher@@ es , pal@@ sy , ten@@ sion@@ ed , dry mouth , slo@@ th@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the sau@@ cep@@ an , so@@ res in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the breast@@ plate , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , weakness , muscles , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ ks , un@@ com@@ ings in the songs , muscle weakness Very frequently :
Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ idal 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity re@@ actions is calculated based on a final degree in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no cog@@ nitive connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ d@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ drug that promotes the combination of the micro @-@ ub@@ b@@ uli out of the tu@@ b@@ ular fever and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mers .
these stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ u@@ sian network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated in the trans@@ ocy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies , that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ator and caused by the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ ds protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the range of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer patients , either in form of solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an un@@ affected general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy but 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound based on Bas@@ eline because of cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity by Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma plasma took effect on multi@@ ph@@ as@@ al manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive ex@@ trav@@ eler distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than according to a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metab@@ oli@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ oxide -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ment was less than 1 % of the total overall dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which refers to an extensive Clear@@ ance .
however , over 75 years of age , however , only few data are available , since only 3 of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected by light light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the auth@@ orization of approval for the office will be provided in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and package of packaging . • With a unique image of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport through patients .
this means that deportation is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference points &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure levels when in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ wn has to be led under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injec@@ tions can also be made by the patient or the maint@@ ain@@ sper@@ son , provided that they have received a reasonable guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients who received chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ binary values should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron value of all patients are used before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron balls should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or thereby , that the body speaks not sufficiently to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a loss loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa .
abor@@ tion was compared with administration in a V@@ ene in a V@@ ene in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , who were inj@@ ected either on se@@ wing or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indi@@ ges@@ tion for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin inj@@ ected ab@@ out@@ ings with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ binary values of patients , which were put on se@@ wing , were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ress@@ ful head@@ aches and confusion .
abor@@ tion may not be used in patients who are possibly superf@@ ici@@ ally sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ch@@ fa or one of the other components .
abor@@ tion as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine was conducted according to the regulations of the European Union , that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which represents Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information regarding medical professionals across all member states , including information about the security of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the traffic of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements for adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiplied my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy alone ( for example , cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with a large blood @-@ volume set ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to adults without iron deficiency , with which a high risk of trans@@ fu@@ sions can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are used to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pap@@ al concentration in which the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ aries between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
an@@ e@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ences can vary depending on age , gender , and total disease @-@ burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease was necessary due to the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in to more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients with individual hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations on or under the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration can be observed .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ckner increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or when the lasting hem@@ ost@@ asis is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be applied in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ e@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance outlets for patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance outlets for patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
initial dose 50 : / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary , with a dose increase of 25 , / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be taken in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ e@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms can vary depending on age , gender , and total disease @-@ burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease was necessary due to the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be applied in the lowest approved dose that is needed for control of an@@ e@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ckner value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value , should maintain the dose of 150 that / kg three times a week or 450 : / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the reproduction number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 that / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 , / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ckner increases by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , should maintain the dose of 300 that / kg three times a week .
in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ckner is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reproduction quantity of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken down .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the exempl@@ ary injection of ≥ 4 blood is required , abor@@ tion should be obtained in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood sp@@ inal program - started , so before the onset of the se@@ amed therapy of large iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given a weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to the operative procedure and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
here , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 . / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the intervention , as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis on the hose of a di@@ oc@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine .

in patients that are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure should have appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an appropriate cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it can not be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin for patients with an initial condition of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled trials , it was not proven to improve survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour activity .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic lap of the bone of the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get contains at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ sta can reduce the symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study involved 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in addition to Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , acet@@ sta was compared to 3@@ 57 patients in two studies and compared with frac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was , whether the levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds the bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding any oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of acet@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in re@@ fu@@ sions .
acet@@ sta can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in acet@@ ylene are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer is willing to prevent acet@@ ylene for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as the similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug may be explained and noted , when they should contact the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fraction .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended annually .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , administration is recommended by the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed for treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long R@@ emission period was observed in patients who have been addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fraction is a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the prevalence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ sta .
patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , as limited clinical experience for this patient &apos;s group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination from older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young@@ sters under the age of 18 , as data are missing to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is used before the onset of treatment with acet@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid tear of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ less symp@@ tom@@ atic hypoth@@ esis may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .

for patients who require dental handles , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the ja@@ w area .
the clinical assessment due to the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual advantage @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases were increased by patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 by 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total incidence of predi@@ sposition between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medicine effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c was associated with kidney dysfunction , which is expressed as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured a year before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure , as well as a restricted kidney function , were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ ylene compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ sta in the kill@@ ings .
all patients received supplem@@ entary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to in@@ fusion centre , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the ja@@ w area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ opor@@ osis ( primarily in the ja@@ w area ) reported the bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of records refers to cancer patients according to Z@@ ah@@ nex@@ p@@ au@@ ctions or other dental .

in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , can be achieved through gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) the efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ( BM@@ D ) - a BM@@ D @-@ T Score for the scra@@ p he@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing verteb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
acet@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an immediate effect over three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic , hips , and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine to 6.7 % , of the total th@@ igh at 6.0 % , the th@@ igh at 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in bone volume when compared to placebo in comparison to placebo .
bone mar@@ ker mar@@ ker the bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of Type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of acet@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ gage was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and sever@@ ity le@@ vi@@ als to all time points .
the acet@@ sta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo for increasing the BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to the total hardness and 4.3 % on the scra@@ per .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction of clinical studies in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures were 7.5 % in acet@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to the once weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not attributable to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day was detected in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
according to the combined results , after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain starch and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for acet@@ sta and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a respon@@ sive study at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( based on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with frac@@ ture treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study was compared to 141 of patients with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients with frac@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , and in the middle duration of the post@@ pon@@ ents phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 5 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ hable .
after that , the plasma seal quickly took up &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0,1 % of the maximum value .
fast bi@@ ph@@ onic disappearance of the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period with an end Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time t ½ h 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body@@ weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
a decreased Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes in metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not yet metab@@ oli@@ zed and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic cor@@ related cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function of ren@@ aming up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
due to severe kidney problems ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , individual outlets of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C is the 6@@ times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , given over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the equivalent of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the equivalent of 7@@ fold in human @-@ therapeutic exposure , corresponding to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C ) .

more allergic reactions , including frequent cases of respiratory problems , addic@@ ts and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care staff when one of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ aired , or notice any side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fraction is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficient with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid tear of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic abandoned , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consul@@ tative Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the trials evaluated by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mono@@ therap@@ y@@ medicine ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medication ) can be used together with another drug medicine ( du@@ al@@ otherapy ) .
additionally , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) that can not be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ actic material or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ actic drug may be maintained , except in patients suffering from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl @-@ drug and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decreases , thereby reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl @-@ material , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ due ingredient in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study conducted in the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin took up 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ ants ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high cap level - acid level of acid in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mono@@ therap@@ y.@@ o. is to be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a approval for the account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and bear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under the age of 18 , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest dose dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range increases , the liver enzy@@ mic values are as soon as possible .
if a patient is developing symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , su@@ sten@@ cy problems , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision whether treatment of the patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one will continue until the presence of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment should be conducted .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir in fatty deposits and associated with fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ i@@ odi@@ on , a low @-@ level reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ low noise values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and at a lower level of patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ oses and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who get pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral bi@@ ologic or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ combination therapy , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the market launch , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but sp@@ ord@@ n@@ ate doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning the frac@@ ture of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated survey incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 female patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or enter , the treatment is ab@@ etting ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one do not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines which are metab@@ oli@@ zed from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the breast , and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ mo@@ ors and frac@@ tional inde@@ xes of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege consisted of three times the upper limit of the nor@@ theastern division equally frequently as under Placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ vest@@ ments .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reports , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning the frac@@ ture of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with cy@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients were treated with compar@@ ative groups .
over a period of 3.5 years the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of the patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation ) rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ity in the trap of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ci@@ de ) .
in a placebo controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate , with insulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - worth 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continue to only have insulin received ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , there showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ans compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and low @-@ level , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ dal decreased .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the sober tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ den@@ ounces tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved on a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , random@@ ized patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups were random@@ ized to either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly stressed , whereby the top concentrations of the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma is usually reached 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the M @-@ IV contribution to efficacy in approximately three times the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , mar@@ ker was found mainly in the area ( 55 % ) and to a lower level in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ist@@ rations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearing of the parent is res@@ emble .
in toxic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree after repeated administration of Plas@@ ma@@ volume enlargement with hem@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to it that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the breast , thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years old ) were induced into hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) of ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ theli@@ um .

Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane was a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin @-@ in , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that blood sugar levels were similar to a strong human insulin .
Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) on human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to take advantage ) .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane was over@@ thrown by diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit to use Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is requested with a longer lasting effect .
injection @-@ pin must be loaded at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels significantly improved by an intensive insulin @-@ therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning changes can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long @-@ acting insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( with re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result that a change of dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane in the patient is needed , this can be necessary during the first dose or months after the change@@ over .
some patients experienced hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning of the symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced than with its previous insulin .
before travelling , which go beyond several time zones , the patient should be noted to bring the advice of his doctor , as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and patients may always ask for other drugs to other medicines .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , which can occur in case of non @-@ sufficient di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and Fer@@ to@@ d in u@@ ter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can lead to consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res , and with temporary or permanent dis@@ rup@@ tions of brain function and even death .
disorders of the Nerv@@ ous System Gel@@ eg@@ ally - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin @-@ therapy with a rup@@ ted improvement of blood glucose levels can be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and skin @-@ cell tissue injury - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y In the injection of injection may cause a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y if failed to change the in@@ sti@@ ch@@ ment within the injection tyres .
general diseases and complaints on the administration site Gel@@ eg@@ ally - local hyper@@ sensitivity to injection during insulin treatment ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) occur .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be continuously developed : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated due to the oral intake of glucose or glucose levels .
diabe@@ tics should always have weddings , cand@@ y , biscuits or sugar fruit juice in themselves . • Heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness are treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxili@@ ary aid or by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously through the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the actual maximum rate is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the overall length is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is justified in this fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of design types ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were drawn into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeat@@ able gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , for carcin@@ ogenic potential and to reproductive fibre , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings .
it is recommended - after having been taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin is taken at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is checked according to the manual for the first use .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already feature signs of cryst@@ ag@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plaster @-@ notes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead bigger urine cryst@@ ag@@ ings that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the u@@ rea production is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , toxic accidents can still occur ; therefore , the patients are recommended for at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of tox@@ ins .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a placebo @-@ drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other medic@@ inal drug treatment ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose u@@ rea production in the blood was in the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once a daily intake of 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ure@@ tic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart disease in history , an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the u@@ aci@@ d@@ ration in the blood as al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia due to diseases which have already been led to urine deposits ( including one out of the patient &apos;s history or present current gyp@@ sum and / or a arthritis ) .
if the serum margin of 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety previously not completely examined ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people have no experiences yet with children and young people , the application of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at in this patient &apos;s group is not recommended .

cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ etic heart disease or de@@ kom@@ pen@@ sive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ aci@@ dic medicines , it may occur during treatment to an acute toxic@@ ation due to the lowering of the serum @-@ acid @-@ aci@@ d@@ ration of the ure@@ th@@ u@@ ction of the tissue .
B. In malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to an ag@@ gregate in the u@@ rea .
liver diseases in phase 3 clinical trials have been observed and most likely to be treated with Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended , before the start of the February treatment and further course , depending on clinical findings and a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ had been no interaction studies on Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ ece ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were also associated with a rise in Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ .@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

in a study with test subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x is a average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which refers to a possible weak @-@ scale effect of Feb@@ .@@ e@@ 6 to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the intake of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) was delayed and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnant data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not leave to side effects of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when using a vehicle , serving machines or exercise of dangerous activities until they can be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not affected their performance .
a pay@@ able higher incidence of the Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) was observed , although no statistically significant differences were found and no cog@@ nitive connection with Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at and in all Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .

7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies in the open long term extension studies were treated in 906 patients up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with Feb@@ .@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
during the long @-@ term renewal studies , related events were similar to those were reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ . treatment groups in total more than once and appeared in patients who received Feb@@ .@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hypertension and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg / dl and 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ en@@ circles up to the start of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared to the treatment with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority between the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared to the treatment with the common dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ circles &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function , the AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in compliance with the percentage of al @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations received 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years the data of the open extension study of phase 3 demonstrated that less than 3 % of patients in the incidence of toxic waste revealed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 revealed treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sy ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gyp@@ sum size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of plaster @-@ notes until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma cent@@ ur@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at is simpler and multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ale increase .
after taking simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after intake doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma circulation of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration width , which is reached with doses ranging from 80 to 120 mg , is constant .

after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ered Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at about 49 % of the dose in urine was found as an un@@ altered February ( 30 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the declaration of urine passed over the urine as well as 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ altered February ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or heavy kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mid @-@ total AU@@ C of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 m ( h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ@@ g / h / ml in the group with heavy kidney function .
12 liver function restriction after taking multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chlorine @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function , the C@@ max and AU@@ C is not altered significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in terms of the AU@@ C of Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ ity in male rats , a statistically significant increase of u@@ bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional pap@@ ill@@ ary and carcin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans .
this findings are seen as a result of a special Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and ur@@ anium composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been established that Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately 3 times the human exposure of human exposure , the maternal toxic@@ ity occurred , which coinci@@ ded with a reduction in raising power and a development delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which tot@@ alled approximately 4.3 @-@ times and in tra@@ verse bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , had no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ opause , which consists of a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before food , drinking or use other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up after the first food intake of the day , that should be done at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 have already been used separately , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients that were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively charged Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
in addition , the company also presented data to suggest that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is equivalent to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tion diseases such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhoea ) , ul@@ cers ( si@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ spher@@ es ( swal@@ lowing problems ) as well as aci@@ dic canc@@ ers .
in patients with advanced hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be used in case of es@@ oph@@ agus , patient with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ mia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who do not stand upright or sitting at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or use of medication ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following references are accurate to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not chew@@ ing the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be made before the first food intake of the day , that should be taken at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ al , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hospital order ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms which are supposed to point out on possible reactions , and the patient should be pointed out at the occurr@@ ence of symp@@ tom@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ spher@@ es , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ yst@@ er@@ ical pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of heavier side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it according to the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point out on a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are given to the patient and understood by patients ( see section 4.2 ) .

clinical assessment due to treatment doctor is decisive for therapy planning on each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients will need to rely on taking a dose of the dose of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet into the next morning after they have noticed her se@@ clu@@ sion .
they should take no two tablets at the same day , but taking taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases resulting from mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before they take other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention trials were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy nor of lact@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of direct damage to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered in adult patients where a kidney or liver was transplan@@ ted to prevent transplan@@ t of transplan@@ ted organs due to the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ me / Progra@@ mmer can already be used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indi@@ ges@@ tion of the efficacy was the number of patients receiving transplan@@ tation after one year ( by example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and examined as Adv@@ oc@@ f is absorbed by the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) as well as insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) .
in patients with advanced hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( particularly some vegetable ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , since the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ patients , should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ ologic treatments .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or increased incidence of side effects , including lower or over@@ immune disease .
patients always should always maintain the same tac@@ ular formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ly control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the Adv@@ agra@@ f dosage should be primarily based on clinical ass@@ essing and toler@@ ability in individual case and blood @-@ level provisions ( see &quot; Recommend@@ ations
after conversion of progra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks should be checked before switching and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as valley mirror , comparable to both formulation and kidney transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks are recommended during the first two weeks after Transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ oc@@ t to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate after@@ ward phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of patients are not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application to supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; therefore , the maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified .
dose recommendations : proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis the oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph@@ s therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
other canned custom@@ iz@@ ations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after gra@@ ft .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t treatment should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from progra@@ f on Adv@@ oc@@ f must be converted to a daily intake of progra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this change@@ over in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose to be carried out .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over of other immune soup res@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ oc@@ f once daily needs the treatment with the recommended initi@@ ation dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
cardiac transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , an oral Initi@@ al dose is 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ tation , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ kre@@ p@@ - and lung transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an application dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood pressure in the connected range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Da kidney function no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum ) , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and an monitoring of the urine volume is recommended .
change@@ over of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to Adv@@ agra@@ f When the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ te to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based on clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual case of full @-@ blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls .
it is recommended common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talks during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion of progra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes to immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous application of substances which could change the tac@@ kling line @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ iz@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley levels are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to severe adverse events including transplan@@ tation or other side effects , which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ular formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ly control of a medical device ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be re@@ frac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ otherapy res@@ sives , there are no clinical data for the rescu@@ ed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation with adult cardiac transplan@@ t and gra@@ ft reactions in childhood are still no clinical data for the rescu@@ ed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a reduction of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable compounds ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or to avoid other plant nur@@ tures during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in blood is offered , as the tac@@ kling blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases under progra@@ f has been described as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which can therefore occur in Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are already existing heart suffer , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure and oils .
as with other immun@@ ity res@@ si@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a solar panel with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ s like headache , changes of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
da Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zes , lact@@ ose containing patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable heal@@ ers , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - Blood mirror with the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to ensure consistent levels of maintaining equal concentrations ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and icon@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ement numbers ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by inhibit@@ ing the gastro@@ intestinal deteri@@ oration .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute detection reactions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will come down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive , and thus increase the hormone ex@@ position , is particularly careful in decisions on recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on Clear@@ ance and can extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a minor number of investigations into transplan@@ tation patients do not provide evidence that under the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va an increased risk of un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
there is an monitoring of new@@ born effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( particularly with its effect on the kidneys ) in u@@ ter@@ o exposure .

cases of BK @-@ virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immune response , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ la@@ ths including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ ric .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will be convey@@ ed by its binding to cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ eic acid ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nu@@ cle@@ ans .
this leads to a cal@@ ming @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transmission due to T @-@ cells and prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

in total , the safety profile of oral program in these published studies have been applied to the observations in the large trials , in which Progra@@ me in liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ tation had been applied to primary immune soup .
lung transplan@@ tation in an interim report of a recently conducted , multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral program was reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
chronic transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year following transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ kling line - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

factors such as a lower hem@@ at@@ nit@@ rite level and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ born faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for transplan@@ tation with higher Clear@@ ance rates observed .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metab@@ oli@@ zed in front of the ex@@ position , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via G@@ alle .
in stable patients ( twice daily ) at Adv@@ agra@@ f ( twice daily ) at Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once a day ) in relation to the overall daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than 10 % lower than by Progra@@ mmer .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditional , con@@ genital blood @-@ related disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of the application , if Adv@@ ant@@ ages are applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ auses like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , it is referred to as a &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human Ger@@ inner factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise established , so the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tics were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human am@@ inn@@ ings factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ egg or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the B@@ ax@@ ter AG company to deliver a approval for the future of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of a factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient .
at the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma seal ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over .
during the treatment of treatment , the appropriate dose and frequency of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ p@@ iegel .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , achieve different half times in vi@@ vo Recovery and different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , of factor VIII per kil@@ ogram of body weight in 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII may not be achieved or if the blood is not gover@@ ned with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be generated .
the adoption speed should be addressed to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 ex@@ position days of the biggest is and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 views and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ al development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the resur@@ gence of ( low tri@@ ms ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
among the greatest number of patients receiving A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who showed an increased risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) calculated using the unexpected drop of the blood stream factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th post@@ oper@@ ative day ) in a patient under contin@@ ual A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ung was maintained throughout the time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Mir@@ ror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values in the 15 post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy up to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low inhibit@@ ing agent ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , at none of the 53 Pap@@ di@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed with severe severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was diagnosed .
previously not treated patients of a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins were analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend towards anti @-@ Cho cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms based on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , more than the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes was reported in several repeated product positions in the study of the study .

based on the data available since the initial application , CH@@ MP has still considered a positive rating , but consider that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE that requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee on Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will withdraw his application for the application of In@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the wheat parts ( tissue , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and relies on ) .
it is a sort of virus that &apos;s genetically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has changed so that there is no copies of yourself and therefore no infections can be solved in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from not defective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , carries normally to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ division , in the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP has checked out the answers to the company &apos;s questions , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on testing the initial documents , the CH@@ MP submitted 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors take advantage for the patient .
the committee further concerns about the processing of drugs in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company had not proven sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way , and that there are neither for the environment even for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company does not set the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified material release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components will be released immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nose syndrome ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be ref@@ using to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ate the nose .
the main structural measurements were the changes of the risk of gras@@ shop@@ per symptoms that were reported from the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported aer@@ in@@ aze were compared with a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , oral drying , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for treatment of allergies ) are not used .
aer@@ in@@ aze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glaucoma ( high blood pressure ) , heart disease or vas@@ cular disease including hypertension ( hyper@@ function of thy@@ roid ) , or have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the EU @-@ Europe company to provide approval from Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without being torn or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under the age of 12 because of failure and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued to sound the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because during long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can take off with time .
following the decline in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients that are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , op@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s patient and the data is not enough to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorders , and the data is not enough to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
patients need to be informed about that treatment of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
for the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with heart rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ aze is ab@@ etting at least 48 hours prior to conduct der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were administered in addition to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo had been detected , regardless of whether disaster has been taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
however , the un@@ think@@ able of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals are not always transfer@@ ed to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ischen properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ Depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation coll@@ ision ) and a CN@@ S stimul@@ ation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ble , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stimul@@ ation is particularly likely to treat children , as well as at@@ roph@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary rigid and - dil@@ ation , skin treatment , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ular cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ary molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was detected .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can cause more sympath@@ etic effects in the recommended dosage , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
1.@@ 248 patients ranged from 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine faced efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the overall score for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nas@@ al skin well@@ being ) significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the ab@@ stain effect , determined by the nas@@ al coating , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze on healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ technical study , which was performed with formulation of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test volunteers des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is po@@ or@@ ly different .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent by P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine to the exposure of a aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ ts@@ ic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may have no particular dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity as its individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was the combination of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml Sir@@ up or w .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and juven@@ iles with an allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients that were also asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of j@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to indicate that the body utili@@ ze the syrup forms , the solution to import and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children is un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted a approval for the EU @-@ Europe company to provide approval from A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of an allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed in accordance with the previous disease and can be resum@@ ed after the sound of symptoms .
during the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during allergies .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not reinforced with the effect of alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse reactions were treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6.9 % of the patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study , at which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ular cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the expression of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ary molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical trial with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , the extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in treating the symptoms such as ni@@ otic , no@@ stri@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ties and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
how on the basis of the questionnaire on the questionnaire of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the cause of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the e@@ ti@@ ology of the e@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited simpler .
as the hist@@ am@@ ination is an enormous factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may also lead to other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria among other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidance .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the translation of size and number of j@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first Dos@@ age .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study .
improvement of the youth up to more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no ten@@ dencies for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not look to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical studies associated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with re@@ peti@@ tive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ ts@@ ic@@ ity leave the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no particular dangers for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
the cri@@ mp doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis should play the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and skin studies .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin may have experienced a higher sub@@ sidy load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years , fully metab@@ oli@@ zed - is identical to children who are normally metab@@ oli@@ zed .
this drug contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or suc@@ rose disease in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol is not enhanced when using A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as compared with the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study involving adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 years , who came to a question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , the extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents have no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets at adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was caused by simultaneous monitoring of alcohol neither to a ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced power induc@@ t@@ ance even to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in treating the symptoms such as ni@@ otic , no@@ stri@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ties and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
how on the basis of the questionnaire on the questionnaire of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis have been shown , decreased A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the translation of size and number of j@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first Dos@@ age .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than at Cau@@ ca@@ asi@@ es ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ul@@ ating children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which is restricted to metabolic syndrome .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6@@ mal higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal period of approximately 120 hours .
there are no ten@@ dencies for clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in case of pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those recommended doses by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company will withdraw his application for the inf@@ antry of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza , in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which might cause a tribe of influenza who could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the influenza virus is up , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( not protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus as a &quot; body alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form qu@@ icker antibodies in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus .
afterwards the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , separated by human body as body foreign ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA ( EMEA ) guidelines .
should you participate in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .
if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic ase is available as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be prescribed if the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral drugs of the patient had previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood proves that the virus is based on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ nights and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system can also delay the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously had not been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah .
this medication was compared with low do@@ si@@ ated spro@@ ckets A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ood , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs .
main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ev@@ ous patients had previously taken a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase grew also the viral load , however , with the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , the viral load of the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment was just as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a more powerful waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continue their previous protein inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generic ase may not be used in patients who are possibly superf@@ ici@@ ally sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ el@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are just as pel@@ vic and harmful to blood concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV in patients suffering from a cereb@@ ro@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ opor@@ osis ( extinction of bone tissue ) or immune re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of a infection that are caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generic ase in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines treated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved by &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted approval for the current account of the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
usually A@@ generic ase has to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ ster@@ ling of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ lin@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resist@@ or and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r as a solution to import is 14 % lower than capsule ; therefore A@@ generic ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for asp@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg k@@ nights twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs twice daily .
2 If A@@ generic ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of spro@@ ckets ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be observed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) must not be used due to risk provision@@ ally and reduced therapeutic effects of am@@ lin@@ avi@@ r during intake of am@@ lin@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic ase does not prevent risk of transmission from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ el capsules should be used together with low doses of spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk of heavy liver and potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis demonstrate a increased frequency of liver function with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored accordingly to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ id , which are not recommended over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible use of the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the anne@@ x function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis not recommended .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration .
for patients who take this medicine at the same time , as@@ par@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma welding ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium diseases , especially if there are still low doses of spro@@ ckets .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high resolution of propylene glyco@@ l , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied to be careful with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on Dur@@ ation 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders , associated .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ement numbers , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous melan@@ oma and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fac@@ torial equ@@ is@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune comparison , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma welding using severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma welding using a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with sp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently undes@@ i@@ rable effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum mirror of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled through the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking cur@@ rant , the am@@ eth@@ av@@ ir@@ mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and ab@@ etting the cur@@ rant .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ gre@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % hum@@ ili@@ ated if Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ nights ) was administered twice daily .
the C@@ min values of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ige surveillance , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
for this reason , the gift of E@@ ren@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adaptation is required .
the treatment with el@@ ong@@ ings in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the dimin@@ ished or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma welding .
when these drugs be used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring needs to be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to delay .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ode@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus linked to an increase in the effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will be given to a reduction of the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ generic ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could be increased the plasma seal of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 2,@@ 700 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines , which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with ali@@ ases , possibly with inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ bit@@ al disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma welding of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ eu@@ pin , Ni@@ eu@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ is@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake with a@@ generic ase may increase the plasma @-@ percentage and associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study included in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ ial intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose secre@@ tion metabolism strongly of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent , are distinctive increases of plasma welding at the same time .
because Plas@@ m@@ RNA increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
there will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ist@@ or@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased when the period of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the application of ex@@ pedi@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ cat@@ ache .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium diseases , especially if there are still low doses of spro@@ ckets .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with equal gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended to conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medication may only be applied to the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ etus during pregnancy .
in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r passes in human breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the power in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed an decreased increase of 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ tility and Re@@ productive ability was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r on the mother@@ land .
the ir@@ cul@@ inity of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were light up to moderate , came up early and rarely led to the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment applied medicines , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah had not previously treated 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) were listed below the examination as in connection with the study drug , and in more than 1 % of patients receiving laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) have been listed as well .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ zi@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ ar fat accumulation ( ch@@ ill ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral do not pre @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( ch@@ ill ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .

oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ condition or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low do@@ si@@ zable rite level ( grade 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception was taken together with low dose of tri@@ glyc@@ eride and CP@@ K values that were treated with low do@@ si@@ zing rite and very frequent .
in case of an overdose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ stic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .
treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed , as with other sp@@ on@@ avi@@ d treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .

an gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure in the 59 included , showed resistance samples which were similar to those with adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) on patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure in patients treated with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations on :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated analyses can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross @-@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistant resistance between Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral weights ( one of them pointed out a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ ce / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resi@@ sten@@ ed isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the following treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ cavi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest k@@ nights &quot; ble@@ w &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average changes from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ sidy threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 , 152 of which were previously treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low dose of do@@ si@@ p@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together .
after 48 weeks in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml of a median increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered by an unexpected benefit from &quot; un@@ approved &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max lowered by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake and the rate of resp@@ or@@ ption was influenced .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume and an enormous penetration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ el@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active concentration during the dos@@ ady interval in the Ste@@ ady State is within the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs have to be induc@@ ing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generic ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ avi@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is made from a solution of 14 % less flexible than of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function should be low to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r plasma , comparable to those who are generated on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of k@@ nights .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats introduced in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma at doses of 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma and carcin@@ oma was not resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , out of the present ex@@ position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , somewhat clu@@ es for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro @-@ core test in rats and chromosome aber@@ rations to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ b@@ abo@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and monitored by the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , after the end of treatment .
studies for toxic@@ ity in young , which were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both in the controls as well as with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
in a systemic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ton@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generic ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of spro@@ ckets ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or slight liver function problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alisation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .
508 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ige surveillance , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with el@@ ong@@ ings in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or would be low .
when these drugs be used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring needs to be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to delay .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will be reduced to at least half the recommended dose 31 at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ eu@@ pin , Nic@@ o@@ pin , Ni@@ eu@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ is@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study included in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ ial intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
with equal gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medication may only be applied to the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the kill@@ ings during pregnancy .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the power in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed an decreased increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the ir@@ cul@@ inity of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an overdose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ stic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resi@@ sten@@ ed isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered with PI pre @-@ treated benefits of &quot; un@@ approved &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ el@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active concentration during the dos@@ ady interval in the Ste@@ ady State is within the range of C@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss ..

the applic@@ ability and the duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on treatment with al@@ dar@@ a to a maximum of 16 weeks each week . • In case of minor bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the cream is charged six weeks twice weekly . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ os , it is during one or two @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles to add three times a week .
the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to the affected skin surface , so that it remains enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated War@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in two studies with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full departure rate in all four main studies were treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a complete decline of 66 % to 80 % in patients with al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair rate was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but intensity of these reactions take back in general during therapy or reactions to fin@@ alize the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made of several days .
clinical outcome of therapy may be judged after the treatment of treatment for about 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
since there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment should be considered in super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , other appropriate treatment forms should be drawn into consideration .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience , therefore the application of previously untreated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study show that at large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .

the available data about acute ker@@ at@@ ose on poor and hands support the effectiveness in this field is not recommended , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions take usually back in the course of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reaction to patients may cause big dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for some days .
the data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions reduced a lower profit rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution when patients receiving an immune response ( see 4.4 ) .

a minimal systemic intake of 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived 0,1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml of the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; it points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data regarding systemic exposure showed that the resp@@ i@@ ration of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ us bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat no doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also carried out four months for the paint application in the mouse with no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice had induced no tum@@ ors at the application of application in three days per week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systematic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk of human exposure because of systemic exposure .

in the study , mainly the security of the medicine was investigated , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( in relation to reducing the concentration of G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who react strongly ( allergic ) on Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information that may be known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the entry of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Cho @-@ m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ñ@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) indicated in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ent metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing it , every 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as each in relation to adverse events during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be done in an appropriate clinical environment , in re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break is due , due to the theoretical increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a dis@@ ruption of treatment , has to be cau@@ tious .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of a slight or medium @-@ sized in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was carried out and / or reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is needed .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate when the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal studies do not leave direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not recommended .
adverse reactions were classified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted pharmac@@ euticals reactions in the context of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , during the Phase 3 study and their extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years have been observed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with heavy M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs , in addition , severe reactions occur , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breath@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug impacts in the context of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , during a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe delay form and treatment duration up to 12 months have been reported , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , it came to a server version , with a severe delay form , mostly within one month to a server version ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) were detected at 13 / 45 patients not by a radio@@ immun@@ op@@ rä@@ zip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients , with which it had never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ale up to low neutr@@ alizing a minor effect on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ va activity in vitro , which seemed to be the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag at the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ i@@ rable pharmac@@ euticals reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse events typically came together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is located in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and the reduction of another accum@@ ul@@ ating sufficient recovery of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ates recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients recruited for the study , the majority of the patients had been recruited , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the unexpected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me had to improve lung function and the in@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintenance of this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the primary FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased significantly more proportional to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ it@@ osis prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease creation , the clin@@ ically significant changes have been taken into account for five efficacy @-@ variable ( at least during the 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement range of shoulder stra@@ ps ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients , who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy combustion form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage for increased G@@ AG@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Har@@ n in week 22 increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean failure form , whereas in the older patients with severe delay form is only limited or no progress in the cog@@ nitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me do@@ si@@ lage schem@@ ata was performed on the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients receiving difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be charged every new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in sing@@ ular gift , toxic@@ ity with re@@ peti@@ tive gift and reproductive fibre , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a other drug against cancer ) , which can &apos;t be removed ( through an operation only ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which cannot attack the turn@@ out epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously been used to have other chemotherapy treatment as all@@ as therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should intake a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin should additionally be given an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood changes are altered , or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents them to share the cells .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to out@@ fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working time in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investig@@ ating the treatment of the malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a other drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the general administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival in A@@ lim@@ ta amounted to 8.3 months , compared to 7,9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients showed that cancer cells were not treated with cancer epi@@ theli@@ al cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the office of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each liquid bottle has to be saved with 4,2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which yields a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , except for the overwhelming disk epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic pancre@@ as bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
at the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment courses and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dosage .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third position .
in patients that received p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of the leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle there must be a dose examination taking place , taking the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood@@ stream or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
patients do not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient need the value before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients with 2 dose agents or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increase of increased efficiency is increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the use of children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustment is necessary to go out over the recommended dose adaptation for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function was delayed by &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value of &gt; the 3.0 fold in the upper limit value ( when failure of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ ques and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ lic count once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neutr@@ ality number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ b and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ g@@ inal toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when a treatment of fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .

the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair access , chair , fet@@ ch / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the transplan@@ tation in transplan@@ tation ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also be used in patients who suffer from the long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which non @-@ sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or lact@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted approval for the release of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is applied to weight reduction in adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cr@@ ate , fet@@ ching diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , the elderly and / or kidney function is not necessary in elderly and / or kidney function .

the probability of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat retail or low @-@ rich nutrition .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i may consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic medication should be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension or elevated cholesterol levels , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists , if the dosage may be adjusted to this medicine .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent dec@@ ep@@ tive contra@@ ction in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study to interaction drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma welding was observed .
in combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values could be influenced ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the norm range .
however , the patients should be recommended , before bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amine should be taken to ensure adequate vitamins ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single one @-@ one dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers at the same time , at the same time , or@@ list@@ at received a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the skins are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
the prevalence of known side effects , which were detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ question@@ able size .
† It is plau@@ sible to plau@@ sible the treatment with all@@ i in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight individuals without having significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at overdose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on human and animal can be assumed by a quick return @-@ education , systematic effects that are attributable to li@@ pas@@ ar properties of or@@ list@@ at .

in clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times daily , absorption of approximately 25 % of food @-@ food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ arian , fet@@ ch@@ du@@ ed diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of up to 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( initial value of 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma parameters from non @-@ metab@@ oli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic doses of metabolic or@@ list@@ at was only spor@@ adi@@ cally and very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .

the most common side effects depend on the effects of capsules together and caused by increasing fat from the body .
these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after the treatment of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat content in the diet perhaps not consistently .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise the nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first taking of capsules with a fet@@ ching diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you usually take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you will exceed your fat limit . • share your recommended fat amount evenly to everyday meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you have to take per meal , not to get them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a durable ref@@ usal to control them in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people where these accompanying symptoms may occur , learn to control them with the time by adju@@ sting their diet .
• Do not apply medicines for children un@@ accessible . • Do not apply all@@ i after the expi@@ ration date . • Do not keep the container tigh@@ tly closed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of emergence of various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Her@@ edi@@ tary diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example , by improving diet and more movement , can prevent de@@ br@@ ating serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals which contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to live permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you can also find as a statement on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day .
note the below below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in gram is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what quantity for you is suitable , take the below information that gives the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Re@@ ward the effect of capsule is crucial to comply with the recommended fat intake .
if you take the same amount of fat like so far , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
in compliance with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase gradually .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you can only burn up daily 150 kcal per day , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and do these too . • Use@@ ful is a food selection with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal product that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ therapies , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not vomiting in 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 153 by 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the Company in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the application of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer risk .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to the prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ nesses , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ ical Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection m@@ esh@@ ed are monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able when choosing Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs which extend the Q@@ T intervals or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to be extended to such an extension .
in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhi@@ bited the activity of the five tested chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , chlor@@ op@@ i@@ ine , chlor@@ op@@ i@@ tin , chor@@ us , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have any significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied when pregnant , unless it is needed by the treated doctor .
clinical studies were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side @-@ side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context , headache ( 9 % ) and hom@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity re@@ actions and reactions in the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing report .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins of adverse events were shown in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ mode relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ term of 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously 1 without D@@ eci@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ized double blind@@ ness study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who were 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously per day .
results of studies with moderately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy have been combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials , chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of the clinical study Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
the aim of the study involved in 221 healthy volunteers from the study was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. @-@ ci@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma cent@@ rations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ term of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the focus time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses ranged from 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients between day 1 and day 5 measured ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , however , the C@@ max was measured after the l@@ ump of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ject , the total @-@ body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
however , in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al and the average systematic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ fle@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and the promotional period can be leng@@ then .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ate frequency of liver cav@@ ity , endo@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of high doses and alo@@ xi are intended for unique use , the relevance of these results are low to humans .
the holder of this auth@@ orization of the application must be informed of the European Commission on the entry into account of the approved drug in the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Experts ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon was able to res@@ emble a biological medic@@ inal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ inary ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference points &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ved ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damage to the liver tissue . moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ tin amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon put data before the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , security and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference rate by 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , as many patients were measured after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns expressed concerns expressed that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the market@@ able medication .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant with more patients than at the reference rate , Alph@@ eon also had more side effects .
aside from this , the test was used to investigate the question , to what medication is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins ) solves not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ sten@@ tion con@@ genital skin infection ) and small in@@ infected la@@ und@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) , destruction and paraly@@ zed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because alarm is not affected against this type of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient speaks for two to three days of treatment , the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial cells produced in proteins ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
main indi@@ ges@@ tion of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was deduc@@ ted after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin hours , al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with breast cancer , about 90 % of both groups involved in the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , it was found that al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ rump@@ tious in the body tissues ) or infections , which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA , were not effective enough .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contract .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go was in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections from the risks of superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , ab@@ stain@@ s or paraly@@ zed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the entry of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement occurred within two to three days , are to be examined once again and an alternative therapy may be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tis@@ ation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled down carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where MR@@ SA is known or presum@@ ed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary @-@ infected wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients suffering from meth@@ ic@@ illin resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of un@@ infected place .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
because of the low plasma concentration , which were reached after top@@ ical application on the poor skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application increased from 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure of patients , dose adjustments will not be kept for necessary , if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a prec@@ in@@ toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the maternal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systematic antibiot@@ ic regim@@ ent .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or ended with al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of the breast@@ feeding is needed for the infant and the benefit of the alkal@@ ine therapy for woman .
in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect on the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
operation of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the re@@ acting mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding point of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which diff@@ ers from the binding changes of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ier@@ izing anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the ri@@ bos@@ omes ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the pep@@ tide transfer centre is located .
by binding on this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line transfer the Pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interaction and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ omes sub@@ units .
on the basis of the prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear at least some infection forms , should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of a failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resp@@ i@@ ration In a study involving healthy adults , 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be has been published daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma samples were won .
the sample rate was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients , before meditation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 , poor skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on oral tox@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there were neither male nor male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 of reduced skin ) :

ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( illnesses that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two doses existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambi@@ rix may only be used if immun@@ isation exists a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses can be led to an end of two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose against hepatitis A or B can be desired , ambi@@ rix , or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vaccines may affect the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given in the frame one out of three doses existing vaccine .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ ges@@ tion for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month intervals between injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection box , redness , mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not react sensi@@ tively to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. auth@@ orization to take advantage of Ambi@@ rix in the entire area
the standardi@@ zation plan for the prim@@ acy with ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose to be administered between six and 12 months after the first dose .
if a stri@@ ker must be requested for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vaccines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus anti @-@ hepatitis C surface an@@ tigen - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies observed in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not fully assured whether immune competent persons , which have been addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , because they are also protected by immun@@ ologic memory caused by immun@@ ologic memory .
3 . as with all injec@@ tions for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding to medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combined vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ i@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ A and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact result , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ erg@@ ing disorders , ambient rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular gift to bleeding .
if ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ism , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ ologic therapy or patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , no sufficient immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ uring , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ vative hal@@ low vaccine .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ uring on a calculation base per vaccination dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the entire vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who received ambi@@ rix had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of mat@@ eness was comparable high ( i.e. throughout the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of distinctive pain and accuracy was low and comparable , that was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccines , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with the 3 @-@ doses combine with a 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , after vaccination with ambient temperature , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix was a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection box ) per dose , not pro pro@@ s@@ band .
the share of vaccines , which reported about severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schem@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statistically significant .
in clinical trials , which were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Serb conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one month , a month of 6 booked dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second one month , a month of 6 booked dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a similar study , which was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses .
among the 289 persons , whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was precious , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ im@@ pf@@ es significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were reached in a clinical comparison study at 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with ambient temperature or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were at the time of the prim@@ acy between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ity in this study observed immun@@ otherapy against both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ an A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme .
if the first dose is Ambi@@ rix in the second year of age , with the dri@@ zzle of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ on , tet@@ anus and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ cence to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical changes .

the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted by viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , ambient rix can not protect themselves completely before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines and hepatitis B virus ( although you can &apos;t feel un@@ comfortable or feel sick / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent a vaccine .
protection against other infections , which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be utter@@ ed by ju@@ ck@@ end skin rash , breathing , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with a fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually required administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an in@@ oc@@ ulation with ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a dimin@@ ished content of effective operations per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti @-@ combin@@ ant ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content is usually administered one month after the first dose , and will give you a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series .
sometimes ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to people suffering from severe bleeding problems , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child under@@ go / under@@ go your child .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can be in@@ sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Please give your doctor if you have to receive other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without mer@@ ging ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ coding / or if you have received / your child recently , or if you have been given to immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or that is planned in the near future .
it can be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible different lim@@ bs .
if ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , ambient or lact@@ ating women will not be given , unless it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you had an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , please contact your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 single doses ) : • pain or complaints at the in@@ sti@@ ch@@ ment or redness • Mat@@ ness • Rei@@ g@@ ness • headache • Appe@@ als of appetite

ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first auth@@ orization of the entry into account , CH@@ MP re@@ jects the view that the benefit risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive .
since ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the low patient ex@@ position .
Ammon@@ ites can also be found in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ compatible En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain injury due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ia is administered - split by several single boxes to the meals - swallowed , under the food or mixed about a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( due to the abdominal ceiling in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( due to the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was no compar@@ ative study since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a non @-@ drug medicine , that is without the active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia may also cause loss of loss , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ ten@@ tion , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle causes high ammon@@ ia levels .
ammon@@ ia was approved in &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , an indication of an indication of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ p disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein toler@@ ant and the patient &apos;s necessary daily intake of protein .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from a breakfast fixed lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ci@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be administered to patients with swal@@ low disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately available in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) containing sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium pro 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ verg@@ ent heart failure or heavy kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and can be applied only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate exceeds the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate for young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural shifting and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delay of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional neur@@ ons in brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to humans in the breast milk , and this is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ i@@ red event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not linked with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dised patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , pen@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) with a single dose dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ is@@ limit of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is an metabolic active link con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis began early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly infectious , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ proof An@@ alog@@ a within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , proteins reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) diagnosed illnesses to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate came with many too mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ci@@ yl@@ ase @-@ Man@@ gel ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in sober healthy adults and in cases with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after intake of the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ cent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was diagnosed .
in the majority of patients with u@@ rea cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate was det@@ ectable up to 20 g / day in different doses ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning by no@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single boxes ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken by either oral ( infants and children who can still swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or about a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ke or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum samples should be held inside the normal area .
in patients who suffer from a breakfast fixed lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ci@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium pro 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat orders were exposed before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dised patient who developed an metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , pen@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the outlet of excess
based on investigations of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were detected 15 minutes after taking the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ cent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must receive the medication above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare disorders , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot reti@@ re according to the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you study laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go over to breast milk and could harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , desc@@ endant of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ enti@@ ation , memory problems and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor immediately or with the listing of your hospital for a corresponding treatment in connection .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ aired , or notice any side effects that are not specified in this manual information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the box and the container to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be used until &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If you have examined laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on same individual outlets or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( hose which is led by the nose in the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op of gran@@ ulate . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife over the upper edge of the knife to remove surplus weight . • Take the recommended amount of measuring sco@@ op of gran@@ ules out of the tank .
angi@@ ox is used for treating patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood access to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI is administered to a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attacks to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of ACS @-@ ACS treatment with the effect of angi@@ op@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and GP@@ I compared .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - with preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or audi@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly superf@@ ici@@ ally sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of other components .
it may also be used in patients who recently had an bleeding , as well as in people with heavy high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a approval for the in@@ corporate of angi@@ ography throughout the European Union .
for treating adults with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation attacks ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency stop or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if in other episode a PCI is performed , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention would be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg is needed , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage for angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a certain Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened at 225 seconds , a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the onset of lower ACT values , the re@@ plac@@ ated and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ ck dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney stones ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to a PCI ( if using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine to ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg , and again the ACT 5 minutes to test once again after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated in 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of slaugh@@ tered h@@ ep@@ arin .
• Un@@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully super@@ vis@@ aged in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if there occur in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , most bleeding in the arter@@ ial point of bleeding may occur in patients that occur in a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment principle occur everywhere .
in patients who are treated to War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine was once again achieved prior to the treatment .
based on the re@@ active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood risk .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ and anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly .
the animal tests are in@@ adequate in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ adequate or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .

both in the bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in those with h@@ ep@@ arin @-@ treated groups it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i units for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both slight and heavy bleeding occurred less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl with known blood pressure , reduction of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ocular of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to blood circulation , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ z@@ ations , which appeared in more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ turing , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ pod , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in at 6,000 patients receiving a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in patients with h@@ ep@@ arin treated patients as well as in patients over 65 years more often un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred less frequently than in the comparison group under h@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately inter@@ rup@@ ting and the patient eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed in terms of signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ar , which bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ rical region of Th@@ rom@@ bin , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bin is bound in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ rom@@ bin , and with its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ rom@@ bin s@@ cent@@ red the binding of bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ rom@@ bin re@@ generates .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine , with serum from patients , in which it came to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregate reaction reaction .

if a PCI is done in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ ine was given , and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention would be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ ction inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very small of human insulin , and the change means it is faster and shorter re@@ ten@@ tion time has a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , insulin is not effective in the body of insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance of gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin is detected .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ tery or one of the other components , or in patients that suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must possibly be adjusted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH on approval of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdominal ceiling , th@@ igh@@ te@@ el or delay , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
due to the dimin@@ ished Glu@@ kon@@ o@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin intake , insulin requires patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the real strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , tender , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the approach method can draw a change of insulin requirement .
3 A in@@ adequate dose or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of occurr@@ ence of an hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the right profile of the insulin @-@ used insulin and can therefore change to the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances which increase the blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , angi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , meth@@ oxi@@ fy@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ al , s@@ ali@@ z@@ ema and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , among the effects of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ al counter@@ g@@ inal are being slaugh@@ tered or missing .
animal studies for reproductive studies showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ tery and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ tery occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ised after or@@ ally application .
below are those of clinical trials known to have been detected , group@@ ed according to system organic classes and are frequently listed : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 .

severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose consumption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be performed quickly and the mode of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose monitoring effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a sub@@ proportional increase in the glucose effect , just as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ um has a double so fast response rate as normal human frequency and achieves the complete glucose levels of effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data , it was evident that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with the normal single insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was taken , there was a better post @-@ den@@ ial control than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
after the meal , insulin delivery is turned into 15 minutes after the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as with human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the start of the meal ) before the meal was given ( figure 1A ) as well as in comparison to the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
