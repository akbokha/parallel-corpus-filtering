<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Consultative Report (EPAR), which explains how the studies will be judged by the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) in order to comply with recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please read the packing machine (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to insert (7.5 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madings; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness in which the patients manic episodes (periods abnormal) alternating with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe almond episodes and to the prevention of lack of episodes in patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of gested agitation or behavioural disorders if the oral ingestion of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients, which prepares the swallow of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells below each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazene probably works as a "partial agion" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole works like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less much more than the neurotransmitter seems to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, contributes to Aripiprazene to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and reinstances.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection-solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with halopidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was tested in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body add the melting tablets and the solution to the entry (takes up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with injection solution showed the patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms as the patient who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manure symptoms as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented several times more effective than placebo to perform several episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo had increased symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (nausea), nausea, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, ruthlessness, insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanity tenants (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-serious to severe episodes in patients who were mainly manic episodes, and with which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection-solution in rapid control of gested agitation and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to overtake the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the return of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate-severe episodes of bipolar disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficiency of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Looking at the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors justify that (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treating Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder were not an elevated suicidal risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, hypervolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducer) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, it should be drawn into consideration that reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazene should be applied to patients with varicity in anamnese or at states that are associated with varicity in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) associated with Aripiprazene in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazene, increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixer feeding, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic active ingredients treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polythpsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrine patients and in patients with bipolar Manie due to Comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, which is known as side effects as side-effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centralized medicines such as sea-encoding (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazene, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers an ultra-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism can result in higher plasma inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage for ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosishas before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazene had no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodological morphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazene) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data base to safety in humans and due to the intervention trials in the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprazene has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long term study of 52 weeks, with Aripiprazene, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dysteine and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with halopidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazene treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In a different controlled long term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazene, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with halopidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study on 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was observed in patients under the Aripiprazene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazene and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazene, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that have been reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesis and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazene were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazene; it is unlikely that heredialysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefit is that Aripiprazene has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazene showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor and an excessive affinity for dopamine D4, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenches and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazene in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Positones Emission-tomography showed a dosing-dependant reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and the putsch.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-controlled study 52 the proportion of responsive patients who contribute to study mediation was similar to the study drug in both groups (Aripiprazene 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery asberg- depression, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in return rates, which was 34% in the Aripiprazene group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational dual-blind study involved in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients were included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of about 25 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior effectiveness compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo controlled Monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixer or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazene showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placebo- and active-controlled Monotherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a manor or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, Aripiprazene showed a significant efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to lithium or semi-medicine in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also, Aripiprazole also showed 12 a comparable share in patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on such as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manor or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazene resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing the reduction in the reduction of medical symptoms compared to monotherapies with lithium or Valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase on a stabilisation period prior to Randomanization, Aripiprazene showed a remission compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a setback into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazene, the N-Dealkyung is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination of elimination is nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazole on CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazene, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in pharmacokinetic examination, opener patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Popular-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoke based on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazene and Dehydro-Aripiprazene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose trial in subjects with different cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazene and Dehydro-Aripiprazene, but the study involved only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw keys on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity with repetitive gift, reproductive fibre, genotoxicity and a canogeneous potential, the pre-clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects umphate a dosisdependent side-cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose for humans) and an increase of connierrinringement carcinoma / carczinomes in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the middle steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the failure of Sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- metabolites from Aripiprazole (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole was no more than 6% of the concentrations that were detected in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of the monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which resulted in expositions of the 3- and 11fold in the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Ruheloidal 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a final degree in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no cognitive connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antidkrotubuli-drug that promotes the combination of the micro-ubbuli out of the tubular fever and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting their depolymers.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the mikrotusian network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin is mediated in the transocytosis of plasma components in endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies, that the presence of albumin the transport of paclitaxel promotes the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 albuminator and caused by the albumbinds protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the range of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-blind studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abraxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer patients, either in form of solvent paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an unaffected general state (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metasteries.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy but 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripheral neuropathy grade 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound based on Baseline because of cumulative toxicity by Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of total-paclitaxel to 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposition (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma plasma took effect on multiphasal manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extraveler distribution and / or crossover network of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after Abraxane gift (43%) than according to a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and for two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-oxide -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urement was less than 1% of the total overall dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which refers to an extensive Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, over 75 years of age, however, only few data are available, since only 3 of these age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that deportation is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference points").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure levels when in connection with blood transfusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible, and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with sewn has to be led under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injections can also be made by the patient or the maintainsperson, provided that they have received a reasonable guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients who received chemotherapy, the hemogglobinary values should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilonite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron value of all patients are used before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron balls should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or patients with kidney problems, anemia can be caused by a erythropoietine deficiency or thereby, that the body speaks not sufficiently to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a loss loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of epoxetalfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abortion was compared with administration in a Vene in a Vene in the context of a major study with 479 patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected for at least eight weeks in Eprex / Erypo, who were injected either on sewing or continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indigestion for the efficacy was the change of hemogglobinations between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin injected aboutings with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemogglobinary values of patients, which were put on sewing, were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stressful headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abortion may not be used in patients who are possibly superficially sensitive (allergic) against epoxetchfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abortion as injections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Humanity tenants (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the medicine was conducted according to the regulations of the European Union, that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which represents Abseamed, will provide information regarding medical professionals across all member states, including information about the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the traffic of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements for adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas, or multiplied myeloma who received chemotherapy alone (for example, cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with a large blood-volume set (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied to adults without iron deficiency, with which a high risk of transfusions can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml are used to participate in an autologous bleeding program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for papal concentration in which the hemogglobinaries between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemiesysymptoms and follicences can vary depending on age, gender, and total disease-burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease was necessary due to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin to more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients with individual hemogglobinations on or under the hemogglobin- target concentration can be observed.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobinvariability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemogglockner increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or when the lasting hemostasis is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxettin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored engmeshed to ensure that Epoetin alfa should be applied in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for control of anaemia and aneesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets for patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets for patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobinvariability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored engmeshed to ensure that Epoetin alfa should be applied in the lowest approved dose that is needed for control of anemiesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemogglockner value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocytes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value, should maintain the dose of 150 that / kg three times a week or 450: / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobite increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reproduction number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 that / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">In contrast, the hemogglockner is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reproduction quantity of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoxettin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken down.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the exemplary injection of ≥ 4 blood is required, abortion should be obtained in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood spinal program - started, so before the onset of the seamed therapy of large iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg Epoetin alfa, which should be given a weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) prior to the operative procedure and the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="412">If the recurrence value, taking into consideration the anemia (i.e. the Retikuloocyte "Index"), thrombocytes and leukocytosis are normal, and if no other foundation is found, the anti-erythropotin-antibodies should be determined and an investigation of bone marines to diagnose a PRCA diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data for immunogeneity in subcutaneous use in patients with a risk of anti-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovasculous events were observed when erythropoesis stimulating active ingredients (ESA) were given with a hemogglobination concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epoxins, if the hemogglobinconcentration can be increased over the control of anemiesysymptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobite increase should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month, and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence coronary heart failure or insufficiency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present recognition, the treatment of anemia with epoxettin is not accelerated to adults with kidney insufficiency which are not dialysis, progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">Patients suffering from epoxine alfa should be considered a 2 - 3-week delay between epoxettin-alfa gift and erythropotin response (patients who may have been transluded).</seg>

<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the patient's participation, which should also take into account specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients that are intended for greater elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of epoxetalfa therapy, the cause of anemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopedic procedure should have appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in an appropriate cardiovascular disease.</seg>

<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and youngsters under the age of 18, as data are missing to unthinkable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as for this patient population only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypokalzemia is used before the onset of treatment with acetsta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid tear of the effect of Zoledronic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, mitless symptomatic hypothesis may develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of acetsta (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction of clinical studies in men; the frequency of clinical fractures were 7.5% in acetsta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In a different study in men (study CZ446M2308), the annual administration of aclasta in comparison to the once weekly gift of Alendronat was not attributable to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a responsive study at the end of the six-month trial (based on the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Patients with Aclasta and 107 with fracture treated patients who participated in the follow-up study was compared to 141 of patients with aclasta, compared to 71 of patients with fracedronat patients, and in the middle duration of the postponents phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiples of 5, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosishable.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma seal quickly took up &lt; 10% of the peak after 4 hours and &lt; 1% to 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0,1% of the maximum value.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration of time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased Clearance by cytochrome-P450 enzymes in metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronylic acid is not yet metabolized and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) the renal Clearance of the Zoledronic correlated correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function of renaming up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney problems (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest not lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, individual outlets of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC is the 6times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), given over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influencing.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consultative Report (EPAR) in which explains how the trials evaluated by the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapymedicine) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) can be used together with another drug medicine (dualotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, it can be applied to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) that can not be adjusted with metformin alone in the highest possible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylactic material or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylactic drug may be maintained, except in patients suffering from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonyl-drug and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decreases, thereby reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl-material, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional gift from Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfondue ingredient in a decrease of HbA1c levels by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study conducted in the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who received Actos in addition to insulin took up 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were blurred vision, infections of the upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimulants).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) compared to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high cap level - acid level of acid in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy.o. is to be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a approval for the account of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and bear on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate in which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazon in patients under the age of 18, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from presence at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest dose dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study involving pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about cardiac insufficiency which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of the liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range increases, the liver enzymic values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developing symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, sustency problems, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patients with Pioglitazone will continue until the presence of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosisdependent weight gain was detected, which can stir in fatty deposits and associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemiodion, a low-level reduction in the middle hemoglow noise values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and at a lower level of patients under sulfonylharnoses and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who get pioglitazone as oral biologic or triple combination therapy with insulin-combination therapy, the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, including Pioglitazone, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but spordnate doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema. a suitable ophthalmological declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning the fracture of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated survey incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 female patients treated with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 1.0 fractures per 100%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or enter, the treatment is abetting (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone do not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized from these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA Reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazone to 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the breast, and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turmoors and fractional indexes of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege consisted of three times the upper limit of the northeastern division equally frequently as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylharvestments.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely about heart failure under Pioglitazone reports, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac insufficiency in anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning the fracture of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with cyoglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients were treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years the PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation of specific kernel receptors (Peroxisome proliferation) receptor-g (PPAR-g)) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucoseproduction in the liver and increases peripheral glucosity in the trap of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazon versus Gliclasia was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazon at 69% of the patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazcide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate, with insulin inadequate, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c - worth 0.45% compared with the patients who continue to only have insulin received; a reduction of insulin delivery in the treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, there showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-Quotians compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and low-level, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo under Pioglitazone there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under metformin and Gliclazdal decreased.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides but also improved post-denounces triglyceride level, this also improved on a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcome study, randomized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease in groups were randomized to either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazon is quickly stressed, whereby the top concentrations of the pioglitazone in plasma is usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the M-IV contribution to efficacy in approximately three times the efficacy of pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could not have any relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazon in humans, marker was found mainly in the area (55%) and to a lower level in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolism is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasmakonistrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearing of the parent is resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree after repeated administration of Plasmavolume enlargement with hemlution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to it that treatment with pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the breast, thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years old) were induced into hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-facomaterious polyposis (FAP) resulted in the treatment with two other Thiazolidindigenes to an increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated survey incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 female patients treated with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 1.0 fractures per 100%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">Another study of two years have been investigated the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with pioglitazone or Gliclazdal.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiants were shown in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides but improved beyond the post-denial triglyceride level, which is both over a effect on the tryglyzerid absorption as well as on the hepatic trygerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of their primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortar, non-deadly myocardial infarction, leg amputation above the Knuckles, coronaruarisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries that are linked to the intake of pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning the fracture of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and showed an increased incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 1.0 fractures per 100%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides but improved beyond the post-denial triglyceride level, which is both over a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actuphane was a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin-in, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks of a substance (glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actuphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, which indicates that blood sugar levels were similar to a strong human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actuphane should not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) on human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is to take advantage).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acetphane was overthrown by diabetes in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S a permit to use Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is requested with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection-pin must be loaded at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels significantly improved by an intensive insulin-therapy, the hypoglycaemia warning changes can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (quickly acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin) and / or manufacturing method (with recombinant DNA from insulin-animal origin) may result that a change of dosage is required.</seg>

<seg id="876">Some patients experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced than with its previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go beyond several time zones, the patient should be noted to bring the advice of his doctor, as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and patients may always ask for other drugs to other medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, customizations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley levels are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley levels of Tacrolimus are usually in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for renal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events including transplantation or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacular formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of formulation or regimes should only be made under the engmeshly control of a medical device (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of transplantation with adult cardiac transplant and graft reactions in childhood are still no clinical data for the rescued formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a reduction of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable compounds (Hypericum perforatum) is included, or to avoid other plant nurtures during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in blood is offered, as the tackling blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases under prograf has been described as a cardiomyopathy, chamber or septic hypertrophie, which can therefore occur in Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are already existing heart suffer, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid exposure and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunity ressiva, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a solar panel with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus will come down the Clearance of steroid-contraceptive, and thus increase the hormone exposition, is particularly careful in decisions on receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon Clearance and can extend their half-value.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application, if Advantages are applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clauses like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, it is referred to as a "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the human Gerinner factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is otherwise established, so the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septics were awarded with "excellent" or "well."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human aminnings factor VIII, mouse or hamsteregg or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the Baxter AG company to deliver a approval for the future of Advates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are based on the severity of a factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma seal (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During the treatment of treatment, the appropriate dose and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of factor VIII-Plasmpiegel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different half times in vivo Recovery and different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40, of factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII may not be achieved or if the blood is not governed with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed in order to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be generated.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The adoption speed should be addressed to the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed by IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the first 20 exposition days of the biggest is and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 views and anamnestically known inhibital development was observed, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the resurgence of (low trims) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Among the greatest number of patients receiving ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), who showed an increased risk for formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial application, CHMP has still considered a positive rating, but consider that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the security filter of ADVATE that requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee on Human Rights Committee (CHMP), that the company will withdraw his application for the application of Inexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the wheat parts (tissue, which links other structures in the body, surrounds and relies on).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a sort of virus that's genetically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus," which has changed so that there is no copies of yourself and therefore no infections can be solved in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from not defective in the human body existing p53 gene, carries normally to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the subdivision, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP has checked out the answers to the company's questions, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on testing the initial documents, the CHMP submitted 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors take advantage for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee further concerns about the processing of drugs in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not proven sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable way, and that there are neither for the environment even for people who come in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company does not set the CHMP, whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nose syndrome (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents ages 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be refusing to constipate the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main structural measurements were the changes of the risk of grasshopper symptoms that were reported from the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all the constipation of the nose, patients reported aerinaze were compared with a decrease in symptoms by 46,0% compared with 35.9% in the patients receiving Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who were Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, oral drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnie (sleeplessness), somnolency (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenal active ingredients or Loratadin (another drug for treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (high blood pressure), heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension (hyperfunction of thyroid), or have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a cerebral hemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for the EU-Europe company to provide approval from Aerinaze's entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is in the whole to swallow (i.e. without being torn or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under the age of 12 because of failure and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued to sound the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because during long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrine can take off with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following the decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients that are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined application of Pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstriktors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, opergolin, ergotamine, phenylephramine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's patient and the data is not enough to pronounce appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorders, and the data is not enough to pronounce appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about that treatment of hypertension or tachykarate or tachykarate or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with heart rhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, or Bronchospasmus in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is abetting at least 48 hours prior to conduct dermatological tests, as antihistamine otherwise can reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin who were administered in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the placebo had been detected, regardless of whether disaster has been taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine was not yet identified, so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not hemmed and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">However, the unthinkable of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals are not always transfered to humans and due to vasoconstriktorischen properties of Pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should however be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases to a drowsiness, which can lead to a impairment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS-Depression (Sedation, Apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulation collision) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treble, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, frightened miths, muscular weaknesses, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, corrupted pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, respiratory pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, Ataxy, blurred vision or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely to treat children, as well as atrophin-typical symptoms (oral drying, pupillary rigid and - dilation, skin treatment, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturbular cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhessionary molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplifying subjective drowsiness or tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrine can cause more sympathetic effects in the recommended dosage, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1.248 patients ranged from 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine faced efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined using the overall score for the symptomatic (except nasal skin wellbeing) significantly higher than under a monotherapyephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets in regard to the abstain effect, determined by the nasal coating, was significantly higher than under a monotherapyadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze on healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of pharmacokinetic multi-technical study, which was performed with formulation of healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test volunteers desloratadine is poorly different.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent by Pseudoephedrine to the exposure of a aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity and reproductsicity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin may have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as its individual components, and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was the combination of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and juveniles with an allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients that were also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of jaddling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to indicate that the body utilize the syrup forms, the solution to import and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease from 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin or one of other components.</seg>

<seg id="1732">During the persistent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not reinforced with the effect of alcohol and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should however be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases to drowsiness, which can lead to a impairment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius as in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth-dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse reactions were treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and treated with 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose study, at which up to 45 mg desloratadin (neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturbular cells / basophiles as well as the expression of the expression of the adhessionary molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical trial with multiple outlets, in the desloratadine, a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, the extension of the QTc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplifying subjective drowsiness or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in treating the symptoms such as niotic, nostrition and itching of the nose, itching, lacrities and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">How on the basis of the questionnaire on the questionnaire of quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of the urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology of the etiology of the etiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited simpler.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamination is an enormous factor in all urticular diseases, is expected that Desloratadin may also lead to other forms of the urticaria among other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidance.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the translation of size and number of jaddling at the end of the first Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the youth up to more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadine in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of Desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no tendencies for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine was not yet identified, so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not hemmed and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not look to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies associated with Desloratadin and Loratadin, in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity with repetitive gift, genotoxicity and reproductsicity leave the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromess, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken independently of the meals, to alleviate the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The crimp doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there is no data to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis should play the Anamnese, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and skin studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic desloratadadin may have experienced a higher subsidy load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years, fully metabolized - is identical to children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or sucrose disease insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the effect of alcohol is not enhanced when using Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as compared with the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius as in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multiple dose study involving adults and adolescents, up to 45 mg desloratadine (neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged 1 to 11 years, who came to a question for antihistamine therapy, received a daily disloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children can be similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinically pharmacological study in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, the extension of the QTc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents have no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets at adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no impairment of psychomotor.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP), that the company will withdraw his application for the infantry of Aflunov to the prevention of avian H5N1 influenza, in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which might cause a tribe of influenza who could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the influenza virus is up, which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity (not protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus as a "body alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form quicker antibodies in contact with a Grippevirus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, separated by human body as body foreign), was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not performed in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA (EMEA) guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment, please contact your treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Ageneric ase is available as a solution for entry, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should then be prescribed if the doctor has examined, which antiviral drugs of the patient had previously taken, and the likelihood proves that the virus is based on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day, together with twice daily 100 mg of knights and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system can also delay the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously had not been treated with Proteasehemiah.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medication was compared with low dosiated sprockets Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, who had previously taken proteasehood, with other proteassigns.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indistator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously no proteasevous patients had previously taken a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase grew also the viral load, however, with the children who had previously been treated with Proteasehemiah, very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with Proteasehemiah, the viral load of the viral load after 16-week treatment was just as effective as other proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitor, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a more powerful waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continue their previous protein inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Ageneric ase may not be used in patients who are possibly superficially sensitive (allergic) against amelavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treatment of depression) or medicines, which are just as pelvic and harmful to blood concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV in patients suffering from a cerebroystrophy (changes in distribution of body fat), an osteoporosis (extinction of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndroms (symptoms of a infection that are caused by the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ageneric ase in combination with other anti-retroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines treated HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with konavir in patients who had previously no proteasinhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved by "exceptional circumstances," as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited granted approval for the current account of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-, proteasinhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Ageneric ase has to be administered to pharmacokinetic Boosterling of Ambulavir together with low doses of sproonavir (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amlinavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistor and the treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambulavir as a solution to import is 14% lower than capsule; therefore Ageneric ase capsules and solution are not interchangeable for a milligram per milligram (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aspase capsules is 600 mg Ambulavir twice daily with 100 mg knights twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ageneric ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of sprockets (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Ageneric ase capsules is 20 mg Ambulavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambulavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of sproonavir or other proteassigns were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the failure of data to inconceivable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be observed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used due to risk provisionally and reduced therapeutic effects of amlinavir during intake of amlinavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Ageneric ase does not prevent risk of transmission from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerel capsules should be used together with low doses of sproonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk of heavy liver and potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1948">For patients who take this medicine at the same time, asparase may be less effective because of reduced plasma welding (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Ambulavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium diseases, especially if there are still low doses of sprockets.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high resolution of propylene glycol, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied to be careful with certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Although a Multifactorial equisology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune comparison, higher body mass index), were reported cases of osteoekrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with konavir must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly related to CYP2D6 and are connected to increased plasma welding using severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambulavir which can lead to a virological failure and to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma welding using a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with sponavir, very frequently undesirable effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>

<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if Ambulavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg knights) was administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amelavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambulavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a engmaschige surveillance, as the effectiveness and unthinkable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didano in combination with didanosin, however, due to the antacids component of didanosin, it is recommended that the income of didanosin and Agenerase is at least one hour apart (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, the gift of Erenirenz in combination with Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaptation is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with elongings in combination with amelavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasinhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteasehemmer and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lowers the serum concentration of Ambulavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the diminished or possibly subtherapeutic plasma welding.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs be used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring needs to be made, as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of Ambulavir and Ritonavir is difficult to delay.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambulavir and Riodeutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus linked to an increase in the effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is used together with Agenerase, will be given to a reduction of the dose of Rifabutin to at least half the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with ageneric ase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out but could be increased the plasma seal of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 2,700 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole a day to 2.69fold compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines, which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be used together with aliases, possibly with interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions, which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasinhibitor, it is advisable that Antacids should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorbital disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva, known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Ambulavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasma welding of Ambulavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipine, Nieupin, Nieudipin, Niodipine, Nisdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Ambulavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with ageneric ase may increase the plasma-percentage and associated side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study included in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times a day), while endogenous cortisol increased by about 86% (90% confidenial intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose secretion metabolism strongly of CYP3A4 is dependent, are distinctive increases of plasma welding at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because PlasmRNA increases of this HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using Ambulavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilising the mirror, as the plasmakonistorations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased when the period of Ambulavir can be increased (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase may not be used together with oral-recorded midazolam (see section 4.3) while the application of expediase with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-catache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ambulavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium diseases, especially if there are still low doses of sprockets.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as Ambulavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With equal gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contractiva is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended to conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the benefit of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medication may only be applied to the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the foetus during pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The irculinity of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were light up to moderate, came up early and rarely led to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment applied medicines, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with Proteasehemiah had not previously treated 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) were listed below the examination as in connection with the study drug, and in more than 1% of patients receiving laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) have been listed as well.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance testing, Genotypical interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of Ambulavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein-inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for the presence of the mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I54V and L90M, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I54V and L90M, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I54V and L90M, with nibavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to attract the current interinterpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Analyses clinically validated analyses clinically validated analyses can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of Ambulavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein-inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Ambulavir associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, which remains sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistant resistance between Ambulavir and other proteassigns for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistence, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral weights (one of them pointed out a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), Lopunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Saquince / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambulavir maintains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor resistened isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders, which can affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with kcavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, soC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest knights "blew" received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average changes from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subsidy threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of ungeboosterly Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged between 2 and 18, 152 of which were previously treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase solution was used in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given a low dose of dosipavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs together.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml of a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, the treatment optimisation should be considered to be considered by an unexpected benefit from "unapproved" Agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is to the maximum serum concentration of Ambulavir about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax lowered by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambulavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambulavir 12 hours to dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake and the rate of resporption was influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume and an enormous penetration of Ambulavir from blood circulation in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unbound ambabor, which represents the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn amelavir remains constant, the percentage of free active concentration during the dosady interval in the Steady State is within the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs have to be inducing CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are given at the same time (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Ageneric ase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ampavir exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambulavir is made from a solution of 14% less flexible than of the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal function should be low to the elimination of Ambulavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Ambulavir plasma, comparable to those who are generated on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambulavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of knights.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with Ambulavir in mice and rats introduced in male animals benigne hepatocellular adenoma at doses of 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Ambulavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma was not resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, out of the present exposition data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, somewhat clues for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames-Test), micro-core test in rats and chromosome aberrations to human peripheral lymphocytes was ambabor neither mutations nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and monitored by the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase, after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young, which were treated at a age of 4 days, showed both in the controls as well as with ambabor treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus-tonation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Ageneric ase capsules are used without the reinforced addition of sprockets (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Ageneric ase capsules is 20 mg Ambulavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambulavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or slight liver function problems with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects like Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Normalisation ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age, and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambulavir which can lead to a virological failure and to a resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="2227">The data from an open, controlled long term study after four years show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, has been studied in two double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertenderot, not hypertrophic acts within a connected 25 cm2 large treatment area than on the unhairless scalp or face.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies, the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived 0,1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml of the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-time period was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour period after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; it points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data regarding systemic exposure showed that the respiration of Imiquimod was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or superfizius basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month trial for dermal toxicity at the rat no doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced weight and increased milz weight; one also carried out four months for the paint application in the mouse with no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice had induced no tumors at the application of application in three days per week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but because Imiquimod has only a small systematic absorption from the human skin and not mutagenic, is a risk of human exposure because of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were treated in the group of mice that were treated with the effective free cream, sooner and in larger numbers on than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the security of the medicine was investigated, but it was also measured its effectiveness (in relation to reducing the concentration of Gag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme decreased the Gag concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachykardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who react strongly (allergic) on Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be updated every year all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients receiving Aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the entry of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Muñysaccharitin I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) indicated in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherent metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing it, every 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as each in relation to adverse events during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be done in an appropriate clinical environment, in revitational facilities for medical emergencies immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all patients form IgG antibodies to Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break is due, due to the theoretical increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after a disruption of treatment, has to be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipylock) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a slight or medium-sized infusion-conditional reaction, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen was carried out and / or reduction in infusion rate to half the infusion rate where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen / Ibuprofen / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate when the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not leave direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns that were exponated compared to Laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended, while the treatment with Aldurazyme is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions were classified mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmaceuticals reactions in the context of Aldurazyme, during the Phase 3 study and their extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years have been observed (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with heavy MPS-I-conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs, in addition, severe reactions occur, including Bronchospasmus, breaths and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug impacts in the context of Aldurazyme, during a phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe delay form and treatment duration up to 12 months have been reported, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, it came to a server version, with a severe delay form, mostly within one month to a server version (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection from the study) were detected at 13 / 45 patients not by a radioimmunopräzipitation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, with which it had never been to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the Gag mirror in the Harn while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginale up to low neutralizing a minor effect on the enzymatic larva activity in vitro, which seemed to be the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag at the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesirable pharmaceuticals reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse events typically came together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme therapy is located in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrats and the reduction of another accumulating sufficient recovery of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the Lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-phosphates receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients recruited for the study, the majority of the patients had been recruited, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the unexpected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme had to improve lung function and the inability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improvement and / or maintenance of this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the primary FEV is clinically significant over this period and absolute pulmonary volumes increased significantly more proportional to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepitosis prior to treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the Gag mirror in the Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease creation, the clinically significant changes have been taken into account for five efficacy-variable (at least during the 6-minute walk test, movement range of shoulder straps (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients, who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years (16 patients with the heavy combustion form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage for increased GAG- Mirror in the Harn in week 22 increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for these age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean failure form, whereas in the older patients with severe delay form is only limited or no progress in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosilage schemata was performed on the Gag mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients receiving difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be charged every new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to patients with older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in singular gift, toxicity with repetitive gift and reproductive fibre, the pre-clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered along with Cisplatin, before or after the gift of Cisplatin should additionally be given an "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood changes are altered, or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be lowered or reduced the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA, and prevents them to share the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetrexed in its active form is easier to outfit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigating the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was investigated in a major study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their condition.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy effects of docetaxel (a other drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (a further medicines for cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months in the general administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival in Alimta amounted to 8.3 months, compared to 7,9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients showed that cancer cells were not treated with cancer epithelial cells, during the administration of Alimta longer survival times than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission shared the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the office of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Patients do not develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the patient must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient need the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken when in patients with 2 dose agents or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over, compared to patients at the age of 65, an increase of increased efficiency is increased.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for the use of children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinine-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustment is necessary to go out over the recommended dose adaptation for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function was delayed by &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value of &gt; the 3.0 fold in the upper limit value (when failure of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the bone marques and Pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophilic count once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrality number, thrombob and maximum non-hematological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Lower toxicity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 hematological and niginal toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a treatment of folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with pemetre-treated patients need to be used, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure of reduction-related toxity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous taking non-steroid antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for treatment with pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration ation, common high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation of transcellular space a drainage of the ergonomics should be detected prior to the treatment of Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed occasionally, if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application of attenualties (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible shepherd is caused by pemetrexed, men should point out before treatment - Ginn insisted on taking advice regarding the lock.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses can lead non-steroid antiicyllic acid (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicyllic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a reduced Pemetrexed exposition with the result of a proliferating effects of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyllic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and minimized 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Because there are no data regarding the interactivization of NSAIDs with long half-value as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application of Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the activity status during the disease and the ability of interaction between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of INR (International normalised ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as in ande- ren Antimetabolites are expected to be heavy-defendants during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful use of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2508">Patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at after, flatus (winch) with chair access, chair, fetch / oily chair, finish oily secretion (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with ciclosporin (for preventing the transplantation in transplantation) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is applied to weight reduction in adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypocrate, fetching diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not sufficient data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal resorated, the elderly and / or kidney function is not necessary in elderly and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat retail or low-rich nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes, before the beginning of a therapy with alli may consult a physician or pharmacist, because the dosage of the antidiabetic medication should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for hypertension or elevated cholesterol levels, should ask their doctor or pharmacists, if the dosage may be adjusted to this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent deceptive contraction in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study to interaction drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma welding was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In combination of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values could be influenced (internationally normalized ratio, INR) (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as the beta carotins in the norm range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patients should be recommended, before bedtime a supplementary multivitamine should be taken to ensure adequate vitamins (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single one-one dose Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers at the same time, at the same time, orlistat received a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The skins are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The prevalence of known side effects, which were detected after the launch of orlistat, is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unquestionable size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible to plausible the treatment with alli in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg orlistat and multi-doses of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight individuals without having significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of reported cases of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on human and animal can be assumed by a quick return-education, systematic effects that are attributable to lipasar properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect on the lumen of the stomach and the top fertilation through kovalente ties to the active serin-rest of the gastronauts and pankreatical lipasties.</seg>
<seg id="2536">In clinical trials, 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times daily, absorption of approximately 25% of food-food.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocrarian, fetchdued diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomanization), was assessed as follows: as a change of the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a share of participants that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of its initial weight (Table 2).</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal product that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of the patients with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapytherapies, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were not vomiting in 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (153 by 189), compared to 69% of the patients with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Compared with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the Company in Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the application of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer risk.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi to the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a Corticosteroids chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thicknesses, patients with anamnical Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection meshed are monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable when choosing Palonosetron with drugs which extend the QT intervals or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or tend to be extended to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, aloxi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron uninhibited the activity of the five tested chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecetidine, chloropiine, chloropitin, chorus, sertralin and terbinafin) did not have any significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, so Palonosetron should not be applied when pregnant, unless it is needed by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms of observed side-side effects (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with aloxi in the context, headache (9%) and homstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing report.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins of adverse events were shown in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-mode relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for aloxi- overdozation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-term of 7.3 hours) received intravenously 1 without Deciethasone intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blindness study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron received patients who were 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to 1 intravenously per day.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetoed chemotherapy and the study with strong emetoed chemotherapy have been combined in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of the clinical study Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study involved in 221 healthy volunteers from the study was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v.-cionosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma centrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-term of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the focus time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μg / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses ranged from 11 testicular cancer patients between day 1 and day 5 measured (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure (AUC0- ∞), however, the Cmax was measured after the lump of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusinject, the total-body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">However, in patients with severe liver function, the terminale eliminationshal and the average systematic exposure of Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the ventricular defle- and repolarisation and the promotional period can be lengthen.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose has been given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people), which were given daily over two years, led to a proliferate frequency of liver cavity, endoophysis, pancreas, trinierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses of high doses and aloxi are intended for unique use, the relevance of these results are low to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Experts (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was able to resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same veterinary ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference points").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long anhalved) hepatitis C (one by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue has damage to the liver tissue. moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alantin aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon put data before the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, security and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference rate by 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, as many patients were measured after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns expressed concerns expressed that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketable medication.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, based on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar to clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retardant with more patients than at the reference rate, Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test was used to investigate the question, to what medication is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins) solves not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crucistention congenital skin infection) and small ininfected laundations (Riss- or chipping), destruction and paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarm is not affected against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient speaks for two to three days of treatment, the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterial cells produced in proteins) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indigestion of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was deducted after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52,1%) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin hours, altargo and cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with breast cancer, about 90% of both groups involved in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, it was found that altargo was caused by the treatment of abscrumptious in the body tissues) or infections, which were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, were not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo was in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections from the risks of superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abstains or paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the entry of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement occurred within two to three days, are to be examined once again and an alternative therapy may be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitisation or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled down carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where MRSA is known or presumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary-infected wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was caused by patients suffering from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment is no improvement or a deterioration of uninfected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of the low plasma concentration, which were reached after topical application on the poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibit in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application increased from 1% retapamulin salbe on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of patients, dose adjustments will not be kept for necessary, if topical reapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a precintoxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the maternal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if an topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systematic antibiotic regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or ended with altargo, the benefit of the breastfeeding is needed for the infant and the benefit of the alkaline therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2,150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect on the administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Operation of retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The reacting mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding point of the bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the binding changes of other ribosomal interagierizing antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the ribosomes ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the peptide transfer centre is located.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding point, Pleuromutiline transfer the Peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interaction and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomes subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">On the basis of the prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin, the application of retapamulin appear at least some infection forms, should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin versus S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a failure to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Respiration In a study involving healthy adults, 1% retinapamulin Salbe has been published daily under occlusion on intact skin and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retinapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma samples were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample rate was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients, before meditation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of man according to topical application of 1% salbe to 200 cm2, poor skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">Studies on oral toxity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro inspection on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernels for in-vivo examination chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of reduced skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxy study in rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (reduced oscillation) and maternal toxicity was established.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the permit must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system is present, as stated in the 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (Version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed as long as the marketing product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The authorization of approval for the office is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updating of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated spot, you should end the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salts, creams or lotions, which is treated with altargo if it was not expressly assigned to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointages look to one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice, if any complaints may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After adding the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazing band, unless your doctor advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminium tube with a plastic seal, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in a aluminum bag that contains 0,5 g sage.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (illnesses that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two doses existing vaccine, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambirix may only be used if immunisation exists a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses can be led to an end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B can be desired, ambirix, or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may affect the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given in the frame one out of three doses existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indigestion for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month intervals between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection box, redness, mateness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitively to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission shared the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. authorization to take advantage of Ambirix in the entire area</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the primacy with ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose to be administered between six and 12 months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a striker must be requested for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalant vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus anti-hepatitis C surface antigen - and anti-hepatitis-A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immune competent persons, which have been addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccination, because they are also protected by immunologic memory caused by immunologic memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injections for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, corresponding to medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combined vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAVA and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenie or blood clerging disorders, ambient rix can be injected as an exception subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambirix was administered in the second year of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular pertussism, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined Masern- mumps vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunologic therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, no sufficient immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccinations in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturing, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thiomerang and preservative hallow vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the tolerability of ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturing on a calculation base per vaccination dose ambirix, but not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of the test subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who received ambirix had been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mateness was comparable high (i.e. throughout the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received ambirix compared with 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-cans-combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of distinctive pain and accuracy was low and comparable, that was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- and 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with the 3-doses combine with a 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, after vaccination with ambient temperature, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection box) per dose, not pro prosband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported about severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccination schemas with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Serb conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second one month, a month of 6 booked dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second one month, a month of 6 booked dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a similar study, which was conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Among the 289 persons, whose immunogeneity was precious, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose-impfes significantly higher than with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were reached in a clinical comparison study at 1- and 11-year-olds a month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with ambient temperature or a 3-doses vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were at the time of the primacy between 12 and 15 years old, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient temperature in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunity in this study observed immunotherapy against both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitisan A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-old, the Persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose is Ambirix in the second year of age, with the drizzle of a combined diphtherion, tetanus and 8 Haemophilus influenza (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after the rescence to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, ambient rix can not protect themselves completely before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines and hepatitis B virus (although you can't feel uncomfortable or feel sick / feel) a vaccine may not prevent a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections, which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have an allergic reaction to ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be uttered by juckend skin rash, breathing, breathing or swelling of the face or tongue. • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and usually required administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a diminished content of effective operations per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface anti-combinant).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content is usually administered one month after the first dose, and will give you a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambirix is injected to people suffering from severe bleeding problems, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened by a disease or treatment in your / its body's own defense, or if you / your child undergo / undergo your child.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can be insufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>

<seg id="2791">It can be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix is to be given at the same time or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2808">Ammonia is administered - split by several single boxes to the meals - swallowed, under the food or mixed about a Gastrostomieschi (due to the abdominal ceiling in the stomach's leading hose) or a Nasensonde (due to the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparative study since ammonia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a non-drug medicine, that is without the active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also cause loss of loss, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanity tenants (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonaps in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle causes high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was approved in "exceptional circumstances," due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifold form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life of life), an indication of an indication of hyperammonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sip disorders is AMMONAPS also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerant and the patient's necessary daily intake of protein.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from a breakfast fixed lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintrancibamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS pills may not be administered to patients with swallow disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera exists if the tablets are not immediately available in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) containing sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium pro 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with convergent heart failure or heavy kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and can be applied only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate exceeds the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate for young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neural shifting and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delay of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional neurons in brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted to humans in the breast milk, and this is the use of AMMONAPS during the breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not linked with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodised patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, penanzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred with a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) with a single dose dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosislimit of neurotoxicity at a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolic active link conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis began early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly infectious, and the disease resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickproof Analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), proteins reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first lifetime) diagnosed illnesses to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate came with many too mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifold form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of ornithintranciylase-Mangel), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is produced in liver and kidney enzymatic, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in cases with liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after intake of the plasmaconcentrations of phenylbutyrat was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cyclical disorders or hemogglobinopathies, phenylacetate was detectable up to 20 g / day in different doses (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning by noylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single boxes), the medium phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate was treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken by either oral (infants and children who can still swallow any tablets, or patients with sip disorders) or about a Gastrostomike or a Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum samples should be held inside the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from a breakfast fixed lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintrancibamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium pro 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat orders were exposed before the birth of Phenylacate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodised patient who developed an metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, penanzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the outlet of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some cases a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulatform were detected 15 minutes after taking the plasmaconcentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring scoop 0,95 g, the medium measuring scoop 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medication above a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare disorders, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot retire according to the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you study laboratory studies, you need to inform the doctor that you can take AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">Taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding time, you may not take AMMONAPS because the medicine could go over to breast milk and could harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste problems, descendant of hearing, disorientiation, memory problems and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, please contact your doctor immediately or with the listing of your hospital for a corresponding treatment in connection.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for treating patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood access to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in chest basket with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measuring value at the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI is administered to a higher dose, and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attacks to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of ACS-ACS treatment with the effect of angioprotein IIb / IIIa-Inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with heparin (another anticoagulant) and GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without gift from GPI - with preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or audicularisation) after 30 days or a year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI, angiox was just as effective as Heparine, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who are possibly superficially sensitive (allergic) against bivalerudine, other miludine or one of other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also be used in patients who recently had an bleeding, as well as in people with heavy high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that angiox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd a approval for the incorporate of angiography throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For treating adults with acute coronarsyndromen (unstable angina / non-ST-midation attacks (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency stop or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If in other episode a PCI is performed, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, and the infusion for the duration of the intervention would be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg is needed, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage for angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous Bolusement of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a certain Bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened at 225 seconds, a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the onset of lower ACT values, the replacated and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg Infuck dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney stones (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which will be subjected to a PCI (if using bivalirudine to ACS), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg, and again the ACT 5 minutes to test once again after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which resulted in the Phase III- PCI-Study (Replace-2), the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalerudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients is angiox contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated in 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated Heparine or 8 hours after the subcutaneous gift of slaughtered heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Unknown hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of hemostasis and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully supervisaged in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalerudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if there occur in PCI patients under bivalerudine, most bleeding in the arterial point of bleeding may occur in patients that occur in a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while the treatment principle occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated to Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of INR-Werts (International Normalisation Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalerudine was once again achieved prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the reactive mechanism of anticoagulanants (Heparine, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalerudine with thrombocyte aggregationand anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalerudine group as well as in those with heparin-treated groups it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi units for heavy bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both slight and heavy bleeding occurred less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular blood or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl with known blood pressure, reduction of hemogglobinocular of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure, reoperation due to blood circulation, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which appeared in more than 0,1% (occasionally), were "other" puncturing, retroperitoneal, gastropod, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving bivalerudin at 6,000 patients receiving a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalerudine group as well as in patients with heparin treated patients as well as in patients over 65 years more often unwanted events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred less frequently than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately interrupting and the patient engmeshed in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalerudine, a direct and specific Thrombinar, which binds both on the catalytic centre as well as at the Anionenbindrical region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalerudine in Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin scentred the binding of bivalerudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalerudine, with serum from patients, in which it came to heparininduced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no throcyte aggregate reaction reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is occupied by the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI is done in the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg bivalerudine was given, and the infusion for the duration of the intervention would be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose (sugar) in the blood or process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very small of human insulin, and the change means it is faster and shorter retention time has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, insulin is not effective in the body of insulin, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indistator for the effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance of glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin is detected.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% of human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against insulin lultery or one of the other components, or in patients that suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must possibly be adjusted, when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH on approval of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal ceiling, thighteel or delay, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the diminished Glukonoogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin intake, insulin requires patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the real strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, tender, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the approach method can draw a change of insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or termination of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of an hypoglycaemia depends on the right profile of the insulin-used insulin and can therefore change to the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances which increase the blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, angioxetine, fibrate, fluoxetine, methoxifylline, propoxyphal, salizema and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, among the effects of sympatheolytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenal counterginal are being slaughtered or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal studies for reproductive studies showed no differences between intra- linglultery and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lultery occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in the breast milk, nor is it resorised after orally application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are those of clinical trials known to have been detected, grouped according to system organic classes and are frequently listed: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000.</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-silence, cool and blasse skin, tiredness, nervousness or Tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dogs, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to switch the injection box within the injection tyres, can occur in the following a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person or intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be performed quickly and the mode of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose monitoring effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a subproportional increase in the glucose effect, just as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulum has a double so fast response rate as normal human frequency and achieves the complete glucose levels of effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was evident that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-denial glycemic control is achieved as with the normal single insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before meal was taken, there was a better post-denial control than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">After the meal, insulin delivery is turned into 15 minutes after the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi- grooves in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before the start of the meal) before the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as in comparison to the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
