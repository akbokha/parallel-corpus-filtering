to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Connectivity ; please select Extras DO@@ M tree . and open a new window with the DO@@ M which is currently displayed . as default setting the root notes of the document , for example : this item , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root no@@ d .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Connectivity ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of setting up folder hier@@ archi@@ es with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . every object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . according to this way , large files can be easily detected , even if they can be seen far in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently &amp; FS@@ View may be regarded as a graphic and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command is considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; one entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation , the right corner of colour and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on color mode , can be either depth for the light detection of wear letters or mapping a different file names as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , if enough space is available , only if enough space is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rec@@ tan@@ gles is supposed to occur ( whereby the relative position may occur by the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . additionally , you can define the relative position of labelling in the rect@@ angle .
regarding treatment algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . if the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View is not always available , this setting will not always be available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
as distribution of an entry into the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here , it is intended for the labelling and to avoid dis@@ closure of space @-@ loss due to the scope as possible . the best methods of this regarding are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing .
you can design@@ ate the minimal space for one entry on the menu entry . instead , a copy pattern in the area of the parent was shown to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was originally intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color management .
improved database with considerably more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ arrived ; an open source project . that means it is based on the support of En@@ dan@@ gling . you should therefore report problems and improvement .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; try to make use of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use this link , your web browser opens a page in error message system . all necessary information is already registered here . please follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; is a project supported by a community . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can soon answer questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list there will be English speaking , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ arrived ; too .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ arrived ; registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for report in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
if you want &amp; digi@@ arrived ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote file . simply click on the folder symbol folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains equal to all picture folder .

&amp; digi@@ arrived ; dur@@ ations recur@@ sively exclu@@ de the Biblioth@@ ek@@ sp@@ ad in its whole depth . you cannot exclu@@ de any sub@@ folder , unless you add an extraordinary file . this allows you to add an point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take a existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list don &apos;t have photos as symbols . you can change it by clicking on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album symbol . for more details , see the section albums .
once you configured the base folder , you can setup your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my records and My Key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ support : if you use the rough mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ arrived ; possibly deal with the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ support .
how to setup and work with raw files are described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy to use camera equipment is provided , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ arrived ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the computer . the connection can be realized as a turn@@ table . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which is a constantly increasing number of digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of digital cameras to host computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos are slowly de@@ composed and transfers over the serial port is slowly . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ 2@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bri@@ x@@ if support , the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera tools . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly be able to be able to see , or the creation may be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ arrived ; it is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tised ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ arrived ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ arrived ; self conducting .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + rotation speed + F .
the drag and lay of images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the universe , via the horizontal separ@@ ator line or in another application window . the only limitation is that you can &apos;t select a picture in keywords , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to make the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , Movies , and Audio
the text filter is used only for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tern is displayed on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed . which fields will be displayed in the dialog for the Al@@ ben@@ z settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents an organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be stored on the folder , in which the album was first created , sorted by the album , first in the properties of the album . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .

the buttons El@@ ders , average , latest : this set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . in addition , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change will be used in this folder instead .
if you first got an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; the first picture in the album as symbol for &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo of the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to select the picture with the right mouse button &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ ce@@ quot ; select . in addition , you can draw the picture to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be swallowed .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of my keyword list . album collections have a different effect . for the collection , you can always use all the photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . every photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this look with the two links in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album the first time , let &apos;s wait for short while the thum@@ b@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can re @-@ create all curtains in the menu ex@@ tras .
information on each picture will be displayed below the per@@ verse preview . which information is available , you can change via settings ; please select the Albums page and watch the range of thum@@ b@@ nails with your wishes .
the thum@@ b@@ nails have help windows , the releases . if you rest the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help features the main features , including all the key words . the picture above shows the main window below in the main window , shows such a help window .

what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers any part of the process , sc@@ anned or digital photos records any form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan , and practical tips as you can secure your pictures , use , convert , convert , convert , ass@@ ure , ass@@ essing , ass@@ essing , ass@@ essing , ass@@ essing , dis@@ car@@ ving , serv@@ ile , waiting , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ised , seeking , searches , transform@@ ational and exported content that hab@@ itable and exported content that hab@@ itable a mon@@ et@@ arian or cultural value .
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition , information about or documentation of other data which are ad@@ ministr@@ ated by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not need to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you will not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed in a database as well as in the image files , you can easily access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you want to do something into your system . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos are to be stored or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please note that you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on the same location . if you have enough photos , then you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant intake of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will then do not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the ad@@ ata side of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ arrived ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what would like to change ? a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes are available . of course , these are the most important .
now the real work starts , as you should select any photo keywords , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can select all images that can select the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos on the top photos .
let us now proceed with wise , keywords , like to proceed with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import a cat@@ alog@@ ical images from another source of embedded sample , then &amp; digi@@ arrived ; automatically add the images to the right spot . the setting of hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another one . the changed keywords are updated by &amp; digi@@ arrived ; updated throughout the sub@@ trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alogues your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to let most don &apos;t let your photos look , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this to the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you can hear about dre@@ aming , associations , the historical period of time is back , you may even hear the silence . the labelling has changed completely .
for others looking at your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to be the meaning of the viewer , to help Him about the motive that she has moved to understand what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only with a let@@ tering for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ arrived , you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , when you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . if you want to export your pictures into Web galleries , then these labels will tell you about your wishes and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed .
the possibilities offered by Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already somewhat nar@@ row@@ ful and will be able to repeat that one day , in the near future , you can also download the photos on the admission site . you can also export the pictures at the recording venue . however , you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all amended versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the alignment site of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; as information stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for actor and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has been created , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can &apos;t be changed . according to this value , it should not be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for Constitutional Court ) : associated with the author . this field contains the review of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles as : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a comment on the car field , it must be filled out .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the access field to identify the photo . if the photographer wants to be listed here . if the photographer wants to be listed below . if the photograph is shown here , you can see the picture below . if the picture is a picture photo , then the group / agency shows the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they don &apos;t have any protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator , delete or change . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; will provide a module for the handling processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs which lost on the road or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ ative . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data production company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , this cau@@ tious will need to get more difficult than a few years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs to get more expensive . there are offers about Gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe this is in your er@@ equ@@ ator area .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good recording . the best DVD recording systems are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it &apos;s about choosing the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written . therefore , they use a control flow mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it runs under Windows and Linux ; it &apos;s still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disk@@ ettes , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn it slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ately format . read the media using a description , date &amp; author license and then store on a clean , dark dry and on animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppies retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guaranteed include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms by hard drives : dis@@ er@@ error study
shortly : dis@@ ks keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART termin@@ ates the error . this is especially readers and publishing counter . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to excess voltage . of course , you can also produce data loss due to a power out@@ flow before you have saved the files , but these losses are usually able to restore any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make lots of power , this can take heavy damage with computer chips and high @-@ speed measurement . these can cause serious damage . at your calcul@@ ator , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause damage , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs any part of the energy heat and re@@ tains the rest . however , it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not any plug @-@ bar also contains a stress protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he offers the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that he protects against lighten@@ ment and protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should also make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the move .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electricity pipes , it will not really help you . even a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down their data and run the system . some models allow them to be sure that they get the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare it for less than &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be protected for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember any cable before you ride into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup goal for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data .
they are compared to hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar costs ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs € 500 . moreover , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services to be limited to 1 GB . your free memory is limited to you , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very safe . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due for transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you don &apos;t have a photo . it &apos;s quite wor@@ r@@ ying that there is no protection to your computer . nobody seems to have thought of this . no one seems to have thought of this . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable ma@@ ins are a further source for transfers , since they create inter@@ ferences within the data stream . these errors remain un@@ noticed by normal file systems .
even if you are not particularly concerned about transfers problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with record players on low level and can be scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux . read this article in english .
Oracle has started an initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still using the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the notebook and 46 % for job systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft and new@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the spread file systems . a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the research process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and a un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file wasn &apos;t completely stored before the problem entered , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go to the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and the final appearance . even DS@@ LR cameras have the optimum effect for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a high @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you &apos;ll get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro . so , don &apos;t make anyone involved in any data loss . so , you will secure your data frequently after a plan and test these backup before you do anything dangerous as the re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests , you are lucky if the drive was not connected during the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot . don &apos;t forget aircraft disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and thief , are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ous always means a local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said , a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are supposed to be secured . it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . generated a complete moment of time to two time points : the complete securing and the last differentiation .
in@@ corporate backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this is generated several moments . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only checked and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer files , you can only change the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer , on DVD or another op@@ ic medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment should happen manually after you made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual appliances , ... , use of the internet .
with this valuable pictures of the next 40 year survival , that is approximately the time period in which you truly are interested in you because they are remin@@ ded of your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of its nature , everything is said to be careful with caution and re @-@ rate the time . unfortunately , there &apos;s no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always enlarge .
let &apos;s go from which you have set up the scal@@ ability and the area you want to have placed on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and turn it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC and dollar ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ li@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software that can read it , then you can create this yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata . the down@@ side , is that it requires relative many administration information but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F and recommend a slow compression . this format we want to save you to save your images .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism ( Def@@ late ) . however , you can easily store your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed @-@ free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required for use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon sometime .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are stored in a file itself . the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it can be found separately on the link between the met@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and lay down everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . among the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ed efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ arrived , you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata once again . these were cut off by other programs under circumstances .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact details , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ arrived . in section adding a picture to an album you can find a description as you see photos that you already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your night@@ time bench .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn off . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to take a while with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator will appear on the lower end and the thum@@ b@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras don &apos;t display any thum@@ b@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo information stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer . note that for some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS and the image . these information are the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar of the main window of &amp; digi@@ came ; or picture editing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer , click the button to download and then download the pictures of their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in downloading the photos will not be deleted , before you delete the pictures safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the button for downloading &amp; K@@ DE . once you selected the button , use the button to download and then selected the button . the button Selected is da@@ zz@@ ing as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ arrived ; in this case the new pictures are downloaded with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download the buttons , select a dialog box where you can select the target album , where the list of existing records will be sorted out , as normal files are sorted . details of the existing records can read in the section my records . then select the destination from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ arrived ; invites photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of them on a button by del@@ eting the button Del@@ ete . if you want to delete a few , you need to delete it first and then delete the delete selection .
please note that there are no possibility to restore images from the camera . so you should not check out whether the photos are successfully deleted , if you want to delete the photos in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera image , you should do this about the camera level , as this is much faster .
cameras use the file name as fil@@ en@@ ame . normally , the file names will normally be reset , after the photos are deleted from the camera , if you can download photos of different recording studios in the same album , so it can be useful , the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and reflection of the picture and date @-@ based sub@@ scriptions . if you use this latter option , will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos stored on the record . the first two are related to the information about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time to correct all downloaded images .
if you wish to read another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ iz@@ ations you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; for a photo is indicated below the name , which will display the camera in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; can use any information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the heart rate . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side bar ad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information that embedded your camera into the photo .
automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the button and select the automatic rotation at the lower section of the window .
if your camera has made information about the date where the photo was made , &amp; digi@@ arrived ; this under@@ scores are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually disabled , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this option , use the button to add , and select the button based sub@@ al@@ ps at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their calcul@@ ator on their camera is the button to download . select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you , where the images should be uploaded to the camera . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to delete the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to make an area through automatic recording of the GPS data to carto@@ graph@@ ers . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten your photo , where exactly the picture was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , or simply want to document the place of photos , it is well en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has supported many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle , and card refer@@ r@@ als . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last more than manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera running a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format which is supported by the module to geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from images and the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ signs of hair@@ less coordinates which are created by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings to access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; setup in the menu settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
select promotion can display on embedded preview or image editing . specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data will be automatically selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected from the camera interface . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should contain the photographers name of the photographer , as a photographer photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the car field , this field must be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , then this organizations should be entered here , then the group or agency should be listed here , then the group or agency should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this ensures that the met@@ ad@@ ata is constantly contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without being lost without being lost .
image lab@@ s as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG Images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in the pictures . please note : when pictures , which are already labelling , these can be over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ arrived .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter will rest on a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can list the file extension of this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no of these extensions , has been ignored .
the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button up@@ dating right from each category .
the settings of the lighthouse &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have shown different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ y@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can turn the tool@@ bar when using image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this image can be set with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia at the nearest explanation .
with setting P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires an los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
the T@@ IF@@ F files can be compressed with the T@@ IF@@ F @-@ files option . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no effect on image quality since the defect @-@ algorithm uses .
you can save the losses of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the loss of losses , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was still not supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs . currently , it is developing very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default setting is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixel at odd lines . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option gives the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 m@@ esh pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white rot@@ tle of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white is not set off . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect has the effect that under@@ lining images in four steps more details in the sh@@ utter . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ ear , so the parts of your pictures are burned down to look through the in@@ ability of your camera , due to the in@@ ability of your camera , you can create a few unusual results , as they can recon@@ struct the sh@@ lich@@ ter in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . la@@ stly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top light .
this is possible because blue pixels generally not be filling as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to recon@@ struct the missing green and red proportions of the still saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how many color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually .
use the lumin@@ ance value for your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this may also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ image processing can be made . in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ filtered image sensor that features many cameras and which is a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome .
if you know the colour slides of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour@@ ing correction , as you have performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information like the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavi@@ our@@ ing behaviour is opened when an image is opened / color management module with raw files .
click here to delete the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you find all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to rear . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures of color ad@@ ministr@@ ated not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model which you can use . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not have any color mapping or G@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ tur . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not need for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means you must carry out the tone mapping itself .
there are more options such as the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can be returned from a device as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very satisfied , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obvious which color profile is designed for them for what is planned for . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the purpose : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ des and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewing and image processing is supported ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ arrived . these modules are displayed as new entries at the main menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the menu .
short@@ age of tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set under settings in the menu under settings .
more information ( in English ) on K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I Project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ cking is adjusted the time between the entran@@ ces , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata one or from which are embedded on the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features indicate a list of all cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is connected to the computer . currently , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are currently supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have chosen a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / access , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will need to connect the camera with your computer , put them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; Pictures in Mül@@ lei@@ mer view , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you will find a look at the delete pictures of an album . in the sections of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be dis@@ closed , if you use the changes in the right side@@ bar without any review . otherwise , you will need to store the changes with the button changes .
you can also adjust the display of the Welcome screen &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the start of the start , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
setting out after new photos are looking for new photos ; this extended the basic file to new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; if something comes from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you should delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can choose the main window to your taste . these settings can select below settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs are shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you will find further information on this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correc@@ ting and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the updated advertis@@ ements / editing .
the picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so you are under circumstances not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , once you have stored the picture .
so you should have finished a copy of your picture before you change it . you can save it with File Save as well .
as long as you have not stored the picture , you can restore the original image or use the button Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last Save .
virtually every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can return backward , or restore processing or re@@ produced by selecting from the menu .
if you frequently use it , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and remove C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish .
if you push the &amp; L@@ MB ; read the button or restore button in the tool bar , get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also reg@@ ent or restored .
once you start editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation links in the tool@@ bar , picture top , picture down or the entries in the File File . if you have any changes on the current photo , you will be asked whether you want to save this .
you can start in the photo and zoom in that you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or use the entries in the menu menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . normally , you will find the tool@@ bar code . normally , you can also download the tool@@ bar code . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call this in the dialog dialog by &amp; digi@@ arrived ; click the main window . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , you can select the image file image and receive the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; printer dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . complete picture display pages can select from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exports . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions for selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation system , even in the image processing . it will appear when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar and disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view you can insert sha@@ ding with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC sha@@ ding field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you ann@@ ot@@ ted it , use either the button Apply or change to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can write more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting which is always written into the pictures .
the section evalu@@ ates a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ti@@ fications . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the side bar or with the keyboard code Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar will always be applied only on a picture . to evaluate more pictures at the same time , choose the menu and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field , the coding follows the pattern in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box for filtering of the keywords , sample tree , and a select box with the previously shown in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ session related subject .
the keyword is adapted dynam@@ ically to the set search . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many words .
the input field at the bottom line is another relief in the input of keywords at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed through marking of the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all key words are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the sample filter section .
the keyword sample filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sample and search views . if in addition , one or more sample filters from the right side will be used , only the cutting quantity of these two are displayed . all characters are available .
you can also draw and lay down . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can easily put it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialogue that you ask whether you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day . the keyword filters are reduced to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that , a keyword out of the right keyword is drawn on the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
these search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched to settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or his , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can define an expanded search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options see as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution there .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ arrived ; s more specific implementation .
the reason why you set up a far@@ med @-@ administered work@@ flow , you can reach a predic@@ table variation of the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colored work@@ flow you can reach the colors on your monitor or scanners , and the colors that you print or print them from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes on color administration , everybody wants to push the buttons that he wants to press the results that he wants to make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tut@@ orial will allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired outcome .
if your work@@ work@@ flow met all six criteria , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see further information below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB of the de facto standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and what makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and do not need to make thoughts about color spo@@ iled signs ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color brow@@ nish , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent page and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I have decided to work in the s@@ RGB space ?
yes ! if you &apos;re working on the RGB space space or not , you need to monitor your monitor via s@@ RGB mode , so you need to use your monitor on s@@ RGB cables , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , you need to use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool represents five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , equal , automatic and contrast from the menu corrected Automatic correction automatically try to make the best . they will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ability the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as light as possible without its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same method : this method Adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity can be as flat as possible . this means that the same very good results with the improvement of the contra@@ sts , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery which causes either miracle in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est range and a re @-@ ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white off one photo .
the white @-@ right @-@ correction is slightly limited to a color space with 8 @-@ bit color . if you can carry out the white image below . if you can perform the white immediately in the rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will improve your correction better .
this tool is based on a white salt @-@ salt , protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . she will launch it via the menu entry colours White at the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , the original image is adapted as well as the preview of the tool . once you want to see the original whi@@ ch@@ box below , then it is enough to click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pix@@ els below this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic changes will change . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated pictures , most pixel is very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shade adjustment lets you improve or download the sha@@ ding details of your photos .
An@@ stat with the above controls around , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture to calculate the color temperature of the white comparison . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values .
additionally you can set the white off with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indi@@ st@@ ator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of pixels is coated . you will see the combined result in the white comparison . this is displayed in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . any adjustment of the white comparison you have set to store in a text file and re@@ charge later .
the button settings sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white comparison . note that neutral settings will be shown another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the code yeast per color channel of the working image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this code requires even more turn@@ tables , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ s . color mapping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the Hel@@ lig@@ th . a detailed manual for the use of paint profiles , you can draw the chapter of paint management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colours . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound quality , you can find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour defects presents you four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter at your disposal .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ier of the extra light . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas protected by the second lighting were inver@@ ted . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows which chem@@ ically is possible . another increase is finally generated , a negative picture that is not to create on phot@@ op@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and process the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ diction , which makes the colours brilliant and passionate . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet offers highly saturated colors , but also some photographer , especially those hardly made landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filters simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and the lumin@@ osity of photos in the menu . as soon as you are happy with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you have a photo at bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead . if you prefer the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leuk@@ emia / contrast / Gamma is the tool scale correction to improve exposure of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the application for the range of sli@@ ps . more specifically , the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ cks can be placed in the inside and the left side represents the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn to learn is the regulator to move and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , the following options are available on the left .
scal@@ ability : with this select box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is displayed . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic scale is useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two controllers in order to change the output values . for example , compression values can be used , for example , to create an easy picture as background to create something different in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : these buttons can be stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later . the Gim@@ p levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , resources and solar oil . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the hist@@ ogram for rot@@ or , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the transmission indicator indicator controls all color channels , to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here , it is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect on a preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right side :
Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this select box allows the channel to be modified from the module :
in addition to these boxes there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring digital camera mode , linear mode produces a broad bar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short@@ age to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones can be used with dark tones and can be dar@@ ker @-@ dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change a right line on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it off and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every turn you can have generated in the file system and later , the file format is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ven@@ format .

orange filmed : simul@@ ated a black / white film setting with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filtered .
rot@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film setting with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic A@@ scen@@ sion and can simul@@ ate moon li@@ ars to the day time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film setting with an yellow lens filter . this is the natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones whilst adding a bit cold into the sha@@ des . this is very similar to the process of an prints and re @-@ development in a sep@@ ic@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry can be used to use texture .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the form of depth , or three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameters relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a picture is no easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your image . immer@@ sed the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , en@@ capsul@@ ates it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this frame is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple , form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture in any spot . this is also possible at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use text of text , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the bigger the picture , the larger the character set must be . finally , simply dial a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template . apply a template on a picture .
the menu Image Templ@@ ate apply in the image editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you don &apos;t need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add maximum com@@ pressing ( 9 ) to the file size of the template ; please send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template file with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you notice the template . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils appears , a building view that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview three buttons are located with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move on the template under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . then the picture will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; offers three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but created especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
Un@@ sharp@@ fe @-@ mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharp@@ ened . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and is protected by copyright by Winst@@ on Chang .
Ref@@ oc@@ us@@ us may possibly be the best of three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zing pictures require a correction of sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more retro@@ active sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for the private user .
JPEG images has often been used to use internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format , however , must always be broken in during processing .
some scanners turn a sharp@@ ness filter already during reading the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can receive usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with sharp@@ ness adver@@ ti@@ ring . you can correct the menu entry .
you should be careful , however , because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the usable technology is sharp@@ ened . in general , you can add further information and comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . to draw the image a bit soft , it is much easier to use . use the tool to fix it with the menu entry . use the pattern on the right side of the dialog box show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the picture . the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ening mask to strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius provides a how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high resolution images allow larger radios . they should therefore shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount indicates the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant image that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is worth a break out of the maximum RGB @-@ value and the difference amount . one can thus define a minimal difference which is used for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of sharp@@ ened , therefore avoided beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the in@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ading filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . in@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool ref@@ uses re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed quot ; in which it makes a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is used to achieve better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can run it from the menu by calling colors re@@ voc@@ ally in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding down a lot better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding down . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ume has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result of the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel pixel , which is even very strongly influenced by distant Pix@@ els . it causes undes@@ i@@ rable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results . you can bet a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0.5 and the values close by 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter may be very bad as 0,1 . however , values are very bad . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 becomes the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still be screw@@ ed on the picture .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you should use this value to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
match size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase in the match size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any ref@@ using parameters that you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded .
try all conc@@ ision , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible immediately , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and com@@ press , eg ; JPEG , you should apply the module based on un@@ compressed image .
generally , in@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused that in@@ sharp mas@@ king would use a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it has to be seen in@@ sharp mas@@ king . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the impossible filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small @-@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to in@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ arity of the range is dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ te enables a customized color for the pupils . if you like blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are below :
in case you want to adjust the filter settings for a adjust , you can use the riders on smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
details pane p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass in the picture . a value of 0.9 should get details so that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the details of the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dation or CCD noise will produce a high value of wave similar patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 &#93; 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative humidity . therefore set the value to the degree of smokers in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is affecting bigger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is required , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repe@@ ats : returns how often the algorithm are running . usually 1 or 2 normally is enough .
angular step@@ ping up there &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be chosen too small . make sure to create a small angle of a long term . so you should choose this value so much and acceptable for your needs .
integral part of &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral pac@@ emaker in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you can get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubles the duration . we recommend it to leave it .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . correct any adjustment of image errors can be loaded in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it can take a very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can ab@@ rupt the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can see how image errors will be corrected using small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black arti@@ fact that is caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; smoke induction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts which come from dust or hair to the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny smo@@ ker that can be removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the lower settings can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel needs and can be p@@ am@@ pered by the image and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter to the front look around fluorescent changes . if the value is high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and rou@@ ching or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole space can be removed or smo@@ ker tips may occur . put it at a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the smoo@@ thing process of the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance , to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the smoo@@ thing process of the details pane .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas that are typically stronger , however , also the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges can occur when it is high , can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to the edges . he can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this .
store up and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters of space @-@ casting , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how rou@@ gh@@ age can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the smoke induction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . luck@@ ily , you can draw a bit easier than a picture with the menu entry . use this tool to fix the soft tip with the menu entry . use the pattern on the right side of the dialog box showing the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ rable arti@@ facts , film gra@@ iny , scrat@@ ches , compression facts and local errors that takes place in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images , thereby preser@@ ving the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and tex@@ turing . the text translation is developed with another tool , the image error correction was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ylon and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pressive com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should fix these problems .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . any adjustment from photo @-@ restoration can be loaded in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it can take a very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ alization space . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ iny on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo rest@@ oring . this time , tex@@ tures can be viewed on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner which is produced by scanning lighting and phot@@ op@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove Hot@@ pixel &apos;s hot@@ pixel . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw material photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; at a photo with a dark picture sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can explore the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture of the dark picture . note that the assistant will notice the last night and will automatically re@@ load this automatically in the next session .
the picture range and the preview can help you correct the result . the show window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted up in all processes areas .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel @-@ poles . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined on average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ aul@@ ts pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a batch of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a batch of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixel .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixel @-@ block at a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in block .
Ku@@ bisch : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a batch of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure of exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , to correct the image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can &apos;t even light the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ des ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by taking the light into the sensor . Tel@@ e@@ objec@@ tives also show this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ cer filter , which is impossible to keep the necessary shifting time under circumstances , even with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as usual impossible effects are created by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tration and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is used to simul@@ ate the transformation of a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three developers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filters , and with three further exposure of the target .
density : this parameter controls the degree of beam intensity at the point of the biggest density of the fil@@ ters . the standard density is 2.0 , or randomly compens@@ ate an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly compens@@ ate the density of a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a little degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced the light@@ ness of the pixels . you must only adjust the exposure of the target set with these options , as you only need to increase your settings .
if you want a more sensitive re@@ integration of exposure of exposure , so leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leuk@@ emia and contra@@ sting correction was also done with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lenti@@ l distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion . color@@ ings cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ stric@@ ted form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but laughs at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tion can be corrected and positive values are ho@@ ver@@ ed distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value seems stronger than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the reverse mark of the parameter .
zoom : this value scal@@ ates the image size and thereby leads a correction of the first gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inking .
brigh@@ test : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of distor@@ tion correct . the values you use for your image will be stored and used as default values .
the ton@@ ne or cus@@ hion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all conc@@ ision or size changes . in the best way you perform this correc@@ ting as all the first . if you have to re @-@ cut a picture and then add a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea rand or a building wall , in your image , and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cus@@ hion distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
when you correct a cus@@ hion distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transformer or remove the regulator of this dialog .
for most pictures the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves such as recordings from front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct the angles below 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ al @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Inf@@ rared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview allows you to adjust two parameters to film gra@@ iny and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the customized texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ controls changed the amount of film gra@@ fts and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels for re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color formations are missing .
this is an example of Inf@@ rared fil@@ me@@ ek@@ tes applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film gra@@ dation is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ dation at your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer of great silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photography , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of gran@@ ulator . the default value is , even though higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film effects on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil factory . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brushes are better suited for big images . smoo@@ thing controls the gl@@ amour , or from the other side look , the sni@@ per .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processed is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel size is 1 and glass of 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intoler@@ ance gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ ic acid , so it &apos;s not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch for you . this would be good pictures to begin with this .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cover the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the coal filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving marks your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , dark scenery .
the depth allows the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ ength 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the kno@@ cking button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by ir@@ radiation effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : get the image along the formal lines going out by a central point . this is simul@@ ated the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al nonsense : wi@@ ping the image through the pixel by a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ ping the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
movement of movement : wi@@ ping the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ening of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
sof@@ tw@@ ood : wi@@ ping the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shining soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and subtle light .
bulk soli@@ dation : wi@@ ping the image through acci@@ dental displacement of pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the paint pools in the image and wi@@ ped out this without the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives the natural your pictures a nut@@ shell . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ protected algorithm .
the trop@@ hy size allows to change the size of the drops . since the size of the image is not growing , it is often necessary to decrease the size of the drops . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can keep with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a area free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the range of tool to select the area , e.g. a face that will be free to stay free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelves . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the transform@@ ers , rotating or transform@@ ers .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you look up a picture and guess the details ? how can you find the missing information back or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the size of size . select your size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size changes a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel &apos;s pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow job .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge picture . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; uses a further developed approach . based on the basis algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
holding aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the size ratio of the original image is preserved in the input of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is affecting bigger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is required , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and store are used exactly . any input for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by adding a small colour picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only carried out surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together with the mouse , simply by pressing the mouse button , pressing the mouse button and move up the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good overview as your photo by cutting edge . you can create the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle simply create it by simply with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cut @-@ out button , use the button button button in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file File Save or File Save in the File File to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in advance , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . aspect ratio that you defined in dialogue remains .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned .
the tool applies to aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically @-@ cent@@ ered .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the area into the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation , set .
the tool for side effects stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the conc@@ ision tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the cut image and not the original image .
the Com@@ preh@@ ensive Assi@@ stance Service Provi@@ des Help You to extract your pictures better . these assistance are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third el@@ lipse , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in harmon@@ ious triangles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division spread over various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sels or the flower leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used to create your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have already used the golden division in all times when you build your pictures , buildings and even photos , to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two . the resulting part is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden @-@ center provides liqu@@ e@@ fied aid lines if you are using a picture . these assistance are shown below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ lipse , the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye can be in the heart of its composition . it can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles are also slide from the top @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their jack@@ ets are the middle of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ is@@ os@@ ly triangles . diagonal object can be made more dynamic .
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame , create a effect of the professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your focus on one of the inter@@ section and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and ver@@ ticals are used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button colour you can set the colour of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can the auxili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this type can adapt the colour of the lines of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing and tool free rotation . select &quot; Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the shooting angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case can be set in degrees . with the button settings you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right .
for your help , the Free rotation will display a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to positioning the two lines . after having an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transform@@ ers from using the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic accessory . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are developed through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are developed through the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments will generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after completing the perspective , you get in@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to transfer this is the image to cut off from the image processing .
the hose tool is used to move a portion of the picture to the right and the other part into the opposite direction . this is no shooting , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is changed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transform@@ ers .
scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can adjust horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image .
after having carried out the failure , the image will be a bit ver@@ tically . for a single failure , this effect is usually neglec@@ ted , but two jack@@ ings are dou@@ bly neg@@ li@@ gible , and therefore you should avoid this .
after shifting the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image to cut off from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats vary from your system and , in some cases , from the type like these libraries . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ arrived .
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; only shows files in formats to know . this happens from the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can change this list of the file extension &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section configuration you will find further information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to choose to use the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ arrived ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method based on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save money @-@ free if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , you can read more information on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the resource image converter . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
&amp; digi@@ arrived ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all cameras you can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ arrived ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a film file , and is therefore not a film program . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ arrived ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use the program to play playback .

if you can exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was very good , then you can conduct the first four pyramid with the White Module .
many tools you need to edit the camera , included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , pl@@ ot@@ ting , smoke supp@@ lication , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform di@@ alog@@ ical type which is applied to the actual picture before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture in @-@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow the compar@@ ision to change the compar@@ ative mode of sight . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected fore@@ sight .
horizont@@ ally share without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper section shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the area below the selected front area .
divide ver@@ tically . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fore@@ sight , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ wear . the colors used in the general installation page can be adjusted .
( 3 ) : the frame for a preview of A preview . you can withdraw this frame with the mouse within the image and you want to see the preview of the image below . the preview of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower edge : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all input from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely expl@@ aining . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider presents an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker &apos;s mouse button to move up and displayed . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this sets your pictures of ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and select colors .
the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; K@@ DE , can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they can be used in your Personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and last user used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can choose from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or search the files according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows up on the colour . the colour is described under the pal@@ p@@ ette view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select one such selection , click on the section next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with supp@@ ressed lin@@ ker Mau@@ sta@@ ste .
if the check box is inserted under the button colour , the color is inserted in the colour plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ wrote another ; depending on whether the mode is selected , you can choose to select the check box below Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be combined with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end characters , if there are three numbers values in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;

select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it on the left side .
&amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programmes . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science , and so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that ob@@ serves &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ Graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programmes . &amp; k@@ graph ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open or open the Graph@@ s in &amp; Command ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to display more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; cr@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . needed in detail :
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph ; without any argument , the tool@@ bar will open only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last updated files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right on pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions through factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if those in &amp; inter@@ viewer ; loaded file has changed from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can your decision also notice it later . if you want to change your decision later , you can setup the Settings menu settings ; setup , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graph ; by instance ; in the file browser or in command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; or to open the instance or to lad@@ ed graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the program start , you can open all graph@@ s your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected .
if you use several sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be set to one page , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of particular parts of the graph .
side preview with one on several sides distributed graph without head@@ line and with another font
the site again takes place , when a file has changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program each time .
the page opening gives the opportunity to determine the behaviour of &amp; cr@@ us@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is open outside of a current session . you can open a standard behaviour in a new window or determine in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing session , or determine that each time is asked .
the site &apos;s seat management gives the opportunity to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph ; set up a default behavior ( the files in the last session or not ) or determine if requested at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears to be opened more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for geri@@ en graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or stra@@ tified represent@@ ations of geri@@ en graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to right or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as a few edge cutting .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a basic screen size . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically for the correct video format . in addition , you can select a background colour for the di@@ asch@@ au . in addition , you can use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you must first choose the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can launch the module via Extras m@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are displayed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sorting images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you select the file from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD file . if you are planning the file on a TV set , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture below . the speed of the image output is set down below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth image change .
the background colour can be set up next . in doubt , you should make it black . the name and the path of the generated file can set you under name of the MPEG file format . keep the extension of the extension .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go quickly or in all silence a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again .
if a hint appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right button .
the print assist@@ ent allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard photographs . the combined images can also automatically print with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and restart the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview can look at the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be util@@ ised for the white frame . essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
as soon as you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name remains unchanged and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses an los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you have frequently asked to process your pictures or later you should not use the JPEG format as it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted to your settings , you can start converting button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it off .
the stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode , therefore , for example , through testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available , but the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all images in an album . it is using the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting point and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the user .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple pictures of an image collection . it is using the image of a Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can shr@@ ink the image below or enlarge . these are four types of image change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
compressed preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for the photo . the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photo papers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the clu@@ stering images in advance . more images can move to the list of forming pictures and lay down there .
after having launched the module , the pictures window with the selected images will appear . you can add more pictures with a file extensions dialog . for the last selected picture , a preview of the page will be displayed on the right side .
you can also move images to the picture list and add it to the list of images added .
to remove pictures , the selected images from the list of images are removed .
after you selected all images , you can open the new message with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . you need to add the pictures and the subject . these pictures are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t be careful to send a lot of pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts may have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may also send a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and every time you use it again .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , so you have to specify the right path for your installation .
in case you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the election of comments in an attached file , the comments will be attached to the images into a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of files , but it is best adjusted under the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore have P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and not changed the photo quality . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original exit data are added to transmit images .
if the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can see the status reports on the search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button closing , you can ch@@ ase this window ? en .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have shown your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions in the presentation will be activated very elegant images via Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the file name is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option pictures acci@@ dentally select that the pictures are displayed in random order . so it &apos;s not used the order of images in the album .
among the images between the pictures can be placed between each of the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your calcul@@ ator and the selected transition effects . so you should show this before you show your friends !
there is more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . randomly select any transition between the images a different effect .
during Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool bar on the upper left side . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
on the left bottom of the bottom , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

best , for all your HTML files , choose a base folder and for each of the following set a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder , where all your pictures are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should click here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case , if the HTML files are not yet in final destination , you need to manually copy them manually . thus , the import @-@ function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder .
the just described configuration options are based on basic folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name is specified in the output folder .
if you are looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album , you may want to add a HTML page to viewing the images . if you have already got a lot of time to view the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you &apos;ll have to do with &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even make .
with &amp; k@@ ick@@ ers ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image features are associated with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in -@@ files , internal and external . they differ whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all pictures into the file is that you have all pictures together and this file can be so independent . the obvious down@@ side is however the file size .
you can exp@@ orting a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File File ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file is looking for the pictures on two times . first , the images are not found , so the images of the URL , which you have indicated in creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export of images are described , exp@@ orting the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
when Manu@@ ally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worthwhile to compressed the files . if you want to do so , simply dial the export file .
the last option of this site is lim@@ iting the maximum image size . if you don &apos;t want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by , for example , that every picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to stimul@@ ate consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures would like to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you are called the category persons of the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported to the categories in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . one example is shown on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and look at : if you see pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will run the various steps of ( 1 ) visu@@ alization of information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today your videos takes care of . at many places in this manual will talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male securing tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used for future Star@@ ts automatically again . if you want to read another database with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; in the following section of the user book , you will be explained to you .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the preview of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how to create different properties , such as persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
to see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group do instead of all groups of a gli@@ mp@@ eds as explained in .
in view of the installation possibilities , which are available to you for the fixed list of the members . you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window p@@ ens there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; shares his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . nour@@ ishing information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed through the modules . these modules can not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; however , most modules have a help side which you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together among other applications , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; just very little tested , you should first call on the command line with the command &gt; photo album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or about the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I don &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; co @-@ album and other applications , which is also K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; this type of order does not support , simul@@ ates some modules the order for albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ ick@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ ick@@ y album ; the current album which is simply the current view , so all pictures you show the picture shows .
in addition to the current album &amp; album @-@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used in the category dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you have chosen the category people , &amp; k@@ ick@@ album will be done , so if you have chosen people to view the module and continue the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ ick@@ ers are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog box and select the module which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you start &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window below . under the tool bar you can see the window , with which you can &apos;t have any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , but now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all available images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; is the opportunity to see each image with notes on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images to set certain notes simultaneously . if , for example , on all images of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remarks , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you can define three lists with a text box by clicking people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the images inside the list : if you are depicted a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be depicted , so that the used names are post@@ pon@@ ed up to the above , to find people faster and arrange .
if you prefer to select a alphabetical list , click the icon for sorting under the list .
if you have chosen notes on each image individually , you may still need to edit all selected images and select these pictures with notes . just click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture right .
if you have multiple pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to check all these pictures and select the menu item more detail at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the section , it is possible to add an entry into a existing or new revision or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry on a category and make it possible to sort this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you are alphabe@@ tically sorted your categories .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the styl@@ istic dialog by forming the bodies of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make up your own window as a frame by drag him out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also download a frame as well . if you want to download this window later , use the button options ... and then click here window . see this process in the picture .
if you select the post pictures in the browser , you &apos;ll get an overview of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have filters . for example , you can see the size of the thum@@ b@@ nails , by simply down@@ ward pulling the mouse with the middle bri@@ ga@@ ze , configure . try it simply .
when you handle a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you still have no window opened with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding images that you want to delete and press either the removal button or select in the Edit menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; you can have a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; you &apos;ll have to record the pictures somewhere , so you &apos;ll have to record the pictures somewhere , so you &apos;ll find the view of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be loaded .
images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , this is available for pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can view the preview of these pictures .
as you see this feature that you need files from the folder and copy them into . &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; so it does not support you to avoid the inser@@ tion of the question in question . if you want to avoid anger , like the inter@@ rup@@ ture of your pictures , please buy a bigger hard disk to store all pictures .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay some more privacy , filter the images that you may want to see for others , and click on the latest view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also watch all pictures that can see your little sister , watch and select the menu entry .
thus , you have defined what pictures are to be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry into your little sister , allowing all images that you have locked down . if you wish to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to determine a password , which must be entered into the un@@ locking of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password change in your privacy menu .
please consider that this picture protection is not very safe , you can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete this type of password protection . this type of password protection is only available to those who are with &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; not very familiar to defend a look at private pictures .
the reason why you want all your pictures featuring &amp; k@@ ie@@ ver ; manage and spend hours about hours so you want to look at some point . this is why you want to look at some pictures . this is why you can see a picture _ and video viewer . this is why you can see from a preview of how to start .
the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the text @-@ text menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , see , matching entries on this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded multiple pictures in the viewer , you can jump up the buttons on high and picture . you can jump on the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a slide show ; then you can press a new image after a few seconds . as often , a new image will be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or min@@ us . it will be stopped and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability to view &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer used the complete space on the screen . use the input button to switch and back in full screen mode .
if you can use the viewer in the image and zoom out . for her@@ zo@@ oming you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . with the min@@ us button , you can draw out the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the sense of the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is equivalent to a pixel size .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that are in and out with Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes regarding the current picture with the menu point notes from the context menu .
if you can view images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog from the picture to view this name . however , you may only prefer to mark the image and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start viewing the viewer and check them as good or bad while looking for one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you are viewing . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . if you have any pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the presentation view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E Pre@@ face view , then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letter for the characteristic , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; painting on the picture .
the brick will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your brick later .
you can see a picture on the paintings . in order to switch the painting of &amp; k@@ ick@@ album ; on the picture painting it from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to run the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understand .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire models yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object since all the objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the property tree , select the position to insert the object and select either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu insert .
is there multiple possible positions , the following attachment menu will be embedded , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can click on application or dis@@ card the changes with dis@@ rup@@ ting .
if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own society view .
press on a preview of the scene with the chosen texture and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen texture . if you want only one part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen photo shows the control of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire view . this cross is marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the point level of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller , or equal to the stage @-@ chosen visible stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object properties are displayed , and the four graphical views are displayed on the right .
if you don &apos;t like a default window system or if you need any other arrangement , you can adjust it as well . you can also store multiple windows , and simply switch between different orders .
to make a window over or below a present view , you pull the reference to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , take the reference to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view , and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views to another view , you prefer the signing in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card tra@@ cker in the views .
the last possible window frames are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the reference to your desktop or click on the small to the left arrow in the box .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the box bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are weak , you can roots them on any other spot .
the current window view can save you with view window settings ... save . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can run it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the option &apos;s view .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ quality photos .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , click on the tool@@ bar or in the menu view , R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to detect the characteristics of mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the straight picture . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to the input fields .
in the combination box quality you can select the features , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this is a very simple colour and light model to a model of complex diff@@ user @-@ diff@@ user lighting . an exhaus@@ tive description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is tra@@ ded with only a beam ever pixels , various mistakes can occur . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or mar@@ tial effects in curves and lines , besides , details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally see images with this property better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam each pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adapted quickly ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated paint values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam ever . if you calculate the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels , then both pixel will be calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 is charged extra points , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 - g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off J@@ it@@ tering , the rays are changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last attitude for the quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are supposed to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams had no object .
opens a new window for viewing of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialogue window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet supported the full command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the property tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code to the text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code and drag him into the property tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on the help in an image view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your document ten@@ tion and version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ ine ) in the p@@ ads to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the scene of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first used file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the inspection points . the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can adjust the object from points to the button in the context menu of the wire model view . you can set the grid for shifts , sc@@ aling , sc@@ ams and turns .
larger values showed a more precise wire model and thus a better proximity to the displayed objects , but require more time for ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross high detail for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box sample of two adjustable colours .
when you cross ground , a floor will be tra@@ ded below the objects . the floor is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colours .
if you check edge support , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering scenes is used . values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more detailed information about the parameters you can find in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change the existing shut@@ ters or create new window orders . in the section window orders , explains how you can create wind@@ ow@@ els and store .
the combination of the standard window frames : shows all the existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window rules in the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand shut@@ ters shows all the existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window settings . new views can create and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with in@@ lets you get the window below the existing window , with signature card and view the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you &apos;ve just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to follow no more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this instruction , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene : a ball at a level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain about that you can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules for ren@@ ders can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have everything wrong , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; following pre @-@ cleaning window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . mark the scene and select the menu entry . you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name Camera . if it click on it , you &apos;ll see the content of the view object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find more details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag him to the desired position .
if you push the button Apply or the input , change the wire model and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they look at the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could set up a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ able body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the property tree , change the name and press the button Apply or the input . in the object @-@ tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the plain , even though at the moment only as limited end@@ able level . when you run the scene , the plane stretched out until the horizon .
if you can see the object @-@ tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the symbol + before the object . in this case , you can only find the options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the soil to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . select displacement and provide the values as follows :
first choose the bottom to place its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object @-@ tree . you can see the name in the image view ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments are only a mat black material because you can still need settings for the pig@@ ment . do you always remember that you can review the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest way .
if you are in preview no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button Apply and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now set correctly . if you select your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following results :
of course , these are not the colors that you have expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then , select this entry twice ( you can also do this entry twice ( you can also use this entry twice , but the chess boards can only be used with two colors ) :
select an object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should just do this step , as you can already understand the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood . the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the value for the radius : 1 ( do not forget the input of the button or button to press ) so that the ball could float over the ground , as you have moved to the ground for a unit down below .
of course , the ren@@ ders are now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears as a matt black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now draw a material now . as already in the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a color :
select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment , select and select the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click Apply or press the input .
the at@@ titudes of gloss effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ ness is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ting , the ren@@ ders hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , reflecting the scenes ) through each pixel by the objects and is broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog work . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , any scene needs to be cleared , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file , which you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open a new model , or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space .
rest@@ art@@ ed the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last store will be rejected .
you can only select this menu , if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene .
repeat the last re @-@ cat@@ chy command . this menu entry can only be selected if you are using editing .
stores the current window system and opens up a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboards and the default behavior .
opens up a dialogue to change the keyboard code . you can add default short@@ com@@ ings for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; edit or add new .
opens up a dialogue to set up the tool bar . you can add and remove tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to add rough surfaces , without changing any be@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable portrait and browser . the application has a browser @-@ browser , where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in your own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists any files you can display using the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n button or button return .
you can adjust whether any image will be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the right corner . if an appropriate file name is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
set in dialogue - &amp; ball show ; there are five cardboard cards . in three of them , general and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; ball show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short detector for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour that you can go down below . default is no full screen .
if this point is activated , invites &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the actual picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; cu@@ ff show ; at the end of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beam to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the screen &apos;s screen in full screen mode . when in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour .
you can show &amp; c@@ unning show ; show that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
speci@@ fies whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the change of change in sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right beside the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ petitions is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated as long as it is broken down by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right beside the input field . default is 1 .
here , change the short@@ cuts for different operating modes of &amp; ball show ; in the card cards short command for the display window and short detector for browser .
with this option , switch between the second part of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for files in folder . this ad is possible only in the short setting .
displays small icons for the files in folder . this ad is possible only in the short setting .
shows thum@@ b@@ nails for the files in folder . this ad is possible only in the short setting .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the picture increased by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for pictures . &amp; ball show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Photo processing based on &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; show@@ room photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a quick picture working with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and implement correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; show photo ; keep it as simple as possible error or possible improvements . if you &apos;re using this , your browser contains a link to the reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information are already filled , and you can simply follow the guide to release your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show photo ; you can see questions about other users of &amp; show photo ; and hopefully you will soon answer questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , you will be spoken English , you should be powerful this language .
the best start to participate &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to the developers mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options to access the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; setup on these settings . you can switch to this settings . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ st@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colours with what you should show , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions at selected pictures . the same side bar will also be found in the picture editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and retri@@ eve them .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and retri@@ eve them . can also store a dialog for saving , or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before departure .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by check the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialogue to choose from the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . exit &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly treated .
in order to add a picture , the user can only start a fore@@ sch@@ can , then start scanning for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ can can be started through the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom in the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom as well , that the whole preview fits in the window .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview can be selected in the settings , then the picture is displayed in a window window , as below is displayed , then the image is stored and shr@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you will return to the main window .
through the button settings the same named dialogue is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not requested , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores off . dialog for each image opens the dialogue in front of each single sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined file , then you must select save after a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the option save after a file name , then this folder will be saved as a standard for storing the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix to save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to save image quality . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual page . the button above starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing settings can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; am@@ arok ; uses a list of these abbrevi@@ ation and their function . you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ation and functionality . select the correct mouse button in the Player window and select Global key@@ note . click the &amp; am@@ arok &quot; button in the Player window , click on the Player Window and select short command line .
you may also set up the existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ short command work . this will make you make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ arok &quot; Control Center .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions to find mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function could look &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally , Amar@@ ok still has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use dialog , so the user does not run a script .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ult Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the file scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts using Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should lie to each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ utions of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok branches ; send al@@ erts to all the scripts . for this reason , scripts will monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events even if there is no use of it .
configure the script , display the configuration dialog . if a script will take care of each script itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder on the folder where all data is stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script might now query &amp; z@@ b ; for example , the script might ask additional information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata , or the denom@@ inations ) .
volume Change new@@ disk signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ directory it@@ em@@ Title &#93; gives the path to selected files the play@@ list . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also given , so that the script can add the cli@@ cked entry . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ary It@@ em ( sub@@ class it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok branches off , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example , for example , the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive name such as e.@@ g ; B. my skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced Tex@@ os@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly .
the main kri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; am@@ arok branches ; for your entry to K@@ DE apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; quot ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok branches , you can simply draw music to the play@@ list instead of getting through endless menus . maybe you can only search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tors @-@ Browser and the Quick Search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if your decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used . these and many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
typically , you have to enter the following folder in the basis of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok .
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker should not have any difficulties when comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ list .
&amp; am@@ arok ; has some options to enable or de@@ activate some options to enable the comp@@ iling point with the configure script or de@@ activate . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details are required in the system requirements .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ arok , you should use full use .
&amp; am@@ arok ; can be set up without problems with the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok .
player @-@ window displays the Player Window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
consistent : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this means the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed .
voting files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored on the storage location of &amp; am@@ arok ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ arok can be started when a browser is needed .
other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
play@@ list when they save , the current play@@ list is automatically when moving &amp; am@@ arok . check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when moving .
relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise it will be saved the absolute position of the music files .
a current piece of replacement parts are visible , that the play@@ lists window opens up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when switching to the context @-@ browser , automatically displaying the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance of the appearance , you can adjust &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the font section , you can use the use of various writings in &amp; am@@ arok . you can select the text in the following section : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on selected characters , so you can select a specific font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you can design@@ ate the Qu@@ al of choice and can define your own color scheme . in addition , use the activated color of color for front and background colour .
playback at the start continues , that &amp; am@@ arok ; after the program start , play automatically with the piece at the point where it was stopped last .
setting on screen screen on @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on choosing ... to select from dialogue the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check@@ box shadow works that the text is presented in the O@@ SD .
you can use your own colors to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if suit@@ cases are not activated , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field display displays the text in the O@@ SD . by setting plac@@ eholders can be adapted to your needs . below , you can find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama user . thus , you can define , on which screen a multi @-@ target monitor environment is supposed to appear to the O@@ SD .
select the audio card , select an audio @-@ driver from the select box . some drivers are able to activate additional setting options in this box card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can choose the folder , search &amp; am@@ arok . in order to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection with its name , check the check box in addition to its name . this section includes instructions for setting up as with the selected folder .
browse the sub@@ folder : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok branches ; both the cross @-@ crossed and their sub@@ folder to music .
changes : allows &amp; am@@ arok branches ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. music files added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes in your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ arok branches ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- und .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of Collec@@ tors database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another facility is needed in the sub@@ window MySQL device .
the MySQL @-@ setup is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok . under the machine : the computer database is located on which the MySQL database is located . afterwards , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use user name : and password : enter the data for the database connection .
the card sheet last@@ .@@ f@@ m handles the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok branches ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and you need to create music recommendations regarding the current unit .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send check@@ up pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok &quot; ; the name of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
a similar interpre@@ ter will call : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; a list of similar perform@@ ers played on the played piece . note : you may need to see the list in the context @-@ Browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to be written for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD predic@@ ts that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box is used for instance difficulties . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Meeting Li@@ b library . you can read the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . then you can also delete the cap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time , Tag@@ li@@ b is about reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing : please report this bug to the Meeting Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ arok libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , however , has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then it leads to disman@@ t@@ ling met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate the machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 to met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but these are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of trouble and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ essing ) .
this is &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded for most people .

either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts drivers . use an additional driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly developed for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer at the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less contracts react to visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix him .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok branches off . why ?
after installation by G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . carry out register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - store you down , comp@@ ile and install it . execute then in the module file of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module file with ad @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and perform it register again . now start &amp; am@@ arok .

there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already given ( the details about the establishment of this follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to this dynamic play@@ list .
click on the desired play@@ list , drag them to the play@@ list window or click on the right mouse button , or select store . in this way , your current play@@ list is replaced by the new one . so , you should save the old play@@ list !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your play@@ list and you will add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the end of the first piece , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again .
the button New fill the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialog for editing the play@@ list and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to edit editing . as a result , the dialog for editing the play@@ list is opening .
just enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be un@@ parall@@ eled to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list is continuously growing , the setting for coming pieces will be over@@ thrown and they will not hear a bit twice in this play@@ list . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed under evidence of the setting of singing pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which will be kept at the beginning of play@@ list . by doing so , you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces added to play@@ list . if you set out more than 1 , the play@@ list is continuously growing , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can already select an existing re @-@ play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ arok branches ; random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok on script by clicking on script . after installing the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button to get more scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select it to delete the script then click D@@ ein@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please check in section letter of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick instructions will show you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to complete the steps , you need to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , no matter how high the bit rate is required , no matter how high the bit rate is created . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ s@@ less format . use this project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
this quick instructions will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps below , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted a loud @-@ CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
after having made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , please press the button Start button . you can now see a dialog by such or something like this :
in this dialogue window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original file is completed , you will be asked after an empty CD @-@ medium , on which the data are burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .

if you want &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually cho@@ oses &amp; cd@@ record ; typically choose &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , you reach &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality in curved audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for use audio data . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 Decoder can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . lame will be used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio coder module , allowing you to read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , nut@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn it on an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a help program that can convert between different audio formats and can convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video work . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating from mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without Nor@@ mali@@ ze , the different parts of the different albums can lead to the in@@ nice effect that the music pieces can be re@@ treated differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small lin@@ ux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos to the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is required for a new fil@@ en@@ ames .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all ge@@ ared projects . this is the same as if you would save for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what should be done . you can then break between Save and Chang@@ es . moreover , you can also break the closing and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every not stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for every not stored project , what should happen to happen , as if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is an data CD , the added files are displayed in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog for the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only open when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can carry out many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is this ? -@@ help ( reach@@ able via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is only available for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you have files for a multiple session CD . this is useful if you have used files for a multiple session CD . it &apos;s more useful for you to see if this function is not used , so that you can already see the files available on the medium already available files and folders .
this entry is only available for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function can be saved &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only leaves the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create copy of a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also download a picture of a CD which you can then want to burn sometime later . you should also want to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to burn the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a DVD with the help of copying dialog . moreover , there is also the possibility of converting a DVD with the help of copying di@@ alogs , so the target medium does not need to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drives . you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drives .
opens the dialogue to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between writing modes and in@@ kre@@ p@@ ment@@ ell .
a previously generated CD image . the dialog asks you to an * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can immediately be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
a previously produced DVD image . the dialog asks you to an * .@@ iso file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously called DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the aus@@ ed video , code settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small box at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or out of file . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will also be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also includes a context menu with functions such as media info , locks , and locking of the media .
switches the content view or out . the content view allows to select and pulling files into the projection view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if you select a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
switches the head@@ bar in the projection view or out . the head@@ bar is a narrow area that contains only visible if the projection screen contains no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the projec@@ tile clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window to change the key orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands are selected in the upper part , one can adjust the key assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions may be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore system administrator rights are needed , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is meant to person@@ alise and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b is , as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a Sh@@ ell@@ tran@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical , therefore it &apos;s more your taste and the type of task is crucial , which the biting programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to make use &amp; D@@ COP ; you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further features to create new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Bike CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ re@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ er@@ d@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id @-@ D@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you can create a project via command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference it is possible to change the project over K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b features the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only apply to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id remo@@ del@@ l ( K@@ URL ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) Vo@@ id Re@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) Vo@@ id Re@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id set@@ vol@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill out a script project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy ur@@ l / home / tru@@ sty / summer@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the computer installed .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( to read &amp; CD ) data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many co@@ di@@ ers , which are supported by these WAV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . other co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something yourself . if the FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which code / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction of co@@ effici@@ ents , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CDs ; such as already , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection . if it &apos;s not possible to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; even not the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup only has to be made only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD has to be explained ( hopefully ) for understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which will often be stum@@ bled at the beginning .
it can convert in many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is measured manually .
this is just a short list of commands &apos;s commands . on the page step , further information is used , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program for the program &apos;s configuration .
the CD@@ DB will start the CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the internet . )
starts reading and - when a en@@ coder is configured in the code tab for configuration settings - the en@@ coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the standard . it is to note that before , the en@@ coder is configured in the evaluation settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a file named file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programme events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main guidance dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ aster and compression rates and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers &apos; choice .
if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for these distribution . the dis@@ advantages are small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information thanks to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important , as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will be delivered free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rate ) , but compared to OGG lightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rate .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame &apos; help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate around 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ etic for music by young people , portable devices and car stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want to have the absolutely highest quality without any view on the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically collected from the free@@ DB file via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program to create folder and file names , as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ ers , there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title for the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s will be coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ name in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database to read the information up / enter the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself to the calcul@@ ator . it is too note that all other information can be downloaded instead of text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( m . ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you out of the &amp; CD which is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be attached to the music company . all the information can be obtained by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , can be obtained .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it &apos;s active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address can not be used when invo@@ ke the data from server ( this can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically on the next level of mirror is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online consultation of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the whole database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which file program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this is not yet done .
for storing the exp@@ ended WAV files , the code can be selected and thus the required file format can be selected . at the first opening are defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab@@ ular tab for the setup of the co@@ di@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the code is required . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about co@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information can be received via its switch via the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( cover ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the typ@@ ew@@ rit@@ er and reading of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to access both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could be a hint of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check it out for the shell &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips may be how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by copying your quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something which is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any dis@@ appro@@ ving &amp; CD .
here we determine the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program that free@@ zes free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any evaluation of a &amp; CD , if the appropriate settings are found .
the device designation will be handed over to the reader program to read the &amp; CD file data .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map of the general settings . here there is no much to do . there can be an additional conversion defined here . in our example everything will be ventil@@ ated / entered as shown on screen photo .
only in full information please select , so that you will be informed when you are missing details of the sample code ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD files automatically downlo@@ ad@@ able via the Internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of &amp; CD with the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD record ; entry is found immediately if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory entry / file name or tag entries , you can easily changed and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , if you want to enter all manually , you will de@@ activate the select fields and free@@ DB file . however , you can use the database before . however , this is worth about 620 MB . however , these two select fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data en@@ quiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server about the Internet . how do the system which data can get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screen picture above .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . this way , however , the burden between the host is distributed . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls carry the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there may be more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp does exist on your computer )
a number of things at the same time : excuse me , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check it out around the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you are using this thread , then the path / folder will be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . if only one place is available on another drive , you will not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything to enter as it is on screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances , something must be pu@@ ffed up to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient on average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if required . kidney 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE . in case of later changes the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the intervention ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously en@@ codes WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the type as the music on the hard drive , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD which will be described in this section , must be repeated for any dis@@ appro@@ ving &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a bit different from the data available for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD data manually , instead of taking them from the Internet . comments are shown on the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD is set ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD has been identified as audio CD ; identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , then you are looking for questions and answers to help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from the free@@ DB file , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can get this manually through the choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have any local database , but the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Aktu@@ ell title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Ref@@ eller title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ers each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB file , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red notes .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up at the tab card settings ; take a look in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can download the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the code to get more information .
simply select one entry , obviously , with the style of the exclusive CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD data . for more information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields are already filled with the specified data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line of the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked out are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the button All pieces choose at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection read the reading process , so this window appears to be confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with orders and track what is going on .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is now read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message will you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ aster you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , check and coding parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the result of parallel operation . the calcul@@ ator with a am@@ d@@ 64 appears to be no problem with simultaneously read and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the co@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is now available within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , you can already download a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is addressed to people who comp@@ ile the source files , and not for users to use the pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , like the program your needs may be adjusted , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs . best read the step for step example to get the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still alive ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked , without any reference point , as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t open this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and if you want to do something to add or modify , may it do . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has understood this section and is therefore understood with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ dian and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE . besides others he has not have a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system to work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projection driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to draw .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the process used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song end , K@@ Mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file @-@ dialog , with which help you select the required song .
you can also download a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows are allowed in the &amp; k@@ mid ; Windows will also work with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and try the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or get the space button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will start automatically as soon as you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( at several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump on any position by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the control .
if you find that a song is too fast or played too slow , you can click on the left and right of the speed display and get the speed of speed . to get the original temp@@ o , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space button has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the empty button , or the pick up of menu entry in the menu piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you have to manually change anything . if you choose to change the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a type of event , select the menu settings the entries and check boxes . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ize . these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open the collection managers first . click here in the menu collection under the point .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the v@@ ins in the collecting manager .
into the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . concerns you if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button . it appears again the file @-@ dialog , with which help you select the required song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic add to the collection .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when automati@@ sch is not activated for the collection , the opening of a piece is activated and gel@@ ert . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the required song and then click on Rem@@ ov@@ ing .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu image sequence of the menu , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in a collector manager , or use the select list over the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the kno@@ ck next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow right .
in order to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the post previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter if they are not stored at leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that understands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s type Change patch when originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so , you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary conver@@ sions for playing a piece of play .
each section may only appear except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . pre@@ mise for this is , however , that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Another Key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices which are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equality mark is ignored . it is believed that GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you can &apos;t change the order , and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a fire@@ man . for this purpose , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( plum@@ age ) , patch is 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch of the patch is meant to be a different percussion instrument ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( such as some keyboards own ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you must only use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to complete tones on the Persian @-@ channel . check yourself as an example the supplied keyboard maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword must be used in the file name for this channel ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perme@@ ate patch on the Persian @-@ channel patch .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der R@@ atio is multiplied , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ ds @-@ events will be multiplied by the value of n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ for@@ warded to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , so that the value 40@@ 96 is used to do so in the map file ( no dec@@ imal score ) .
this setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard , which is to play a pitch of pitch . unfortunately , try to play some key@@ boards for two sounds up to a oc@@ tave . unfortunately , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , item MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you can see what sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
view the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you like to find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes on very different ways .
well , I can force to force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; you have been compiled because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s homepage )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in the way , enable automatic adjustment to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to temporary collection .
you can double the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default temp@@ o , click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desk ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , or I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to hear a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adjustment to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play the first file . so , adjust the automatic adjustment to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then complete , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to program further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ us Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ le ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much leisure for my hobbies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies , I am planning to collect MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to download where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , send me an e @-@ mail : mask pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really want to send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file . before you send an MIDI file , but you should contact me as I maybe already have the file .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also available on its homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development , search and see pictures . they also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
one sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because sound quality depends essential from your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card unless you can hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . in addition , there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that will only appear if information are shown therein .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections below the menu Book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category of continuous play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you want to balance an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list may also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can choose to choose one name , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click , and as next editing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group only the XML content is displayed this part .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by using the XML configuration files .
the animation at the start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player , the file is ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the start does not need to be short , it will automatically end by opening another source . however , this would be dis@@ rup@@ ting at the end of the animation , so the user can stop the application for a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the advertis@@ ements of a favorite pictures : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; unacceptable ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / ; in the source pack of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the folder / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configuration M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no hor@@ semen for this ren@@ dition dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual processing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played by the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube can be inserted in the play@@ list XML .
in order to play &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must play &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the configuration dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a consol@@ es application and following error messages in the browser &apos;s browser . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to make a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ h@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on will play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , the scanner can be configured as used and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be detected in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected port ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably will contain a DVB @-@ in .
because the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( presumably this type of playing video devices will also work . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functioning in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ wax , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they begin playing with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there hints as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the VCD file / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root as root according to the device . it is definitely sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be tested for each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will test x@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used for comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional puri@@ fication application . among Unix @-@ like systems will probably be accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the following &amp; Linux ; distribution of distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be attracted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile ; web site .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals will be taken into documentation . if the support is requested for this project or the documentation , the contact address should be manufactured using the k@@ ile ; web site .
to get questions or comp@@ ile with the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter &amp; Kate &apos;s Editor .

only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for this . um &amp; lat@@ ex ; correct proof prevail , should good b@@ anners , such as H.

the same as other drawing languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , page accumulation , and text boxes with the text . the introduction will be closed with the command \ \ \ { document } and must be closed with the \ \ \ { document } command .
the rapid entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a notable function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) offers a number of menus for the preparation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
document classes : with this , article &#91; copy &#93; , article &#91; letter &#93; , Letter &#91; Letter &#93; , report &#91; copy &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Card &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : with this the drawing of the system is set to use . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . in case UTF @-@ 8 should use UTF @-@ 8 en@@ coding ( for the correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they only be selected in the check@@ box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the compilation of German lyrics .
new users are now not worried anymore . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this section are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; there is a simple problem for exploring the output file . however , it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and more .
with the automatic understanding of environments ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line ( to input the text ) and the added line for the closing of the text ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ ages the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements are changed through a mouse click on the respective and viewed .
in the creation of its own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many folder ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and systems .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ m search , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on an item in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is covered .
Master @-@ Document : this function is simplified at work with multiple files . with a master document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project , project project can be set up project management system project settings .
quick Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically shown ( unless there are no error in the source code ) .
file transfer : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on to open @-@ up , and it takes no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick @-@ construction .
in view of the editing tool bar , the three large selection of selection should be developed for the fast insert of common elements into the document . the first selection field is available for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the select field is for further items such as keywords , R , notes , notes , notes , or references .
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
regarding : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of selection ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for editing &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are required editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; you can also be written by hand .
the final selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã Ã ¼ e will be used for the definition of the font size . it can be specified for the main text , the fu@@ sions , etc . , the following fon@@ ts are set for :
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection menus are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and the presentation of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason with the hand .
the bra@@ ckets after the command \ \ 1 class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . will not be set up at the beginning , this can happen in the text as well .
once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of menus or button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; add automatically the storage .
if the comp@@ ile of the document should be searched after the errors . when using quick @-@ construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
an area ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size is made . the command \ \ &apos; to { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
the building will only be over@@ seen within the environment ( between \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) . there is no sha@@ ding ( number ) for outdoor purposes within a environment .
there are many types of view of the read and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be used for example specific fon@@ ts , fat pressure , si@@ veness , under@@ lines , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { empi@@ h } : this command is available for the courses and is long as long as it is closed , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be depicted with \ \ empi@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ &apos; quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; pron@@ unci@@ ation language is represented , now follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assist@@ ants have been entered a bit text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . this should be a quote , a few places in fat and spa print and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l e can be returned to the editor ( at the internal viewer ) . an external viewer must be closed on an external viewer .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . easy to try and fun .
DVI ; is a combined file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ oll ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF format or computer screen umbre@@ llas .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can then print the document via file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can begin to test other formats using the B@@ FE in the tool bar .
the fore@@ man search encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . only Modern under settings have to set up remo@@ ver ... tools are to be balanced .
to be placed in a row of the source code , the mouse indicator must be positioned in a line of the source code and will be cli@@ cked on preliminary test . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewer is so@@ aked .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the Middle Mau@@ sta@@ ste in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and to be specified ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; displayed as a text editor ( settings the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
if using quick@@ ness of the &amp; DVI ; viewer is not possible , there may be an error . should an error occurred in the protocol file or in the message window .
the log@@ is@@ tive file is the source source in the source code . in the editor then the text file is always displayed on the line , in which the error appears . to view the correct row , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error code .
as soon as the button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from using the document for the document . the default value are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be used either from the ground or the assistant to the quick preparation of a new document . further information on this section are included in the section .
basic users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates : templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; -@@ / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file can be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and select file template .
when creating a new document , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in at@@ ile settings ... settings are processed .
for creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as such as : \ \ 1 Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that it is related to the commands in editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document then the template &apos;s own template can be selected instead of a standard size .
a template can be created out of any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and can be found under the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for your tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn its delic@@ ac@@ ies , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can tell you directly with reading of the chapter &amp; Kate &apos;s Editor .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command refer@@ ential which can be called on the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click press button to balance the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p will only be selected \ \ par .
in the text of the text , the selected text will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can choose parts of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the solution to browse the most varied types of source codes . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants have to spread . this is a unique kind of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entry is empha@@ sized or the corresponding key stamp . this is also empha@@ sized this jump brand , so it will be automatically en@@ cir@@ cled with the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent m@@ oods , offers important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code ; important functions for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included :
we@@ ars a complete paragraph ( group of lines listed on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines of the source code , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . it is the only prev@@ ailing thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is that the distance is separated by two empty lines .
the word is divided under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also spread &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a wide range ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of the document can be removed from this first and remove through the key of the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to include a faster tool . under editing , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a ship@@ ments of &amp; k@@ ile is included in the description .
it has been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under editing environment for a great simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } is found to be taken at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the entry of many polluted environment commands , the access may be lost quickly . this command is close to the most recent environment , so that the waste environment structure will not be distor@@ ted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that are to do from the processing environment .
this command is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is at the other end of the group calls ( or vice versa ) .
in the entry of many veil@@ ed groups @-@ bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly , the open group can be lost quickly . this command is close to the most recent group , so that the emb@@ ell@@ ished structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the character will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character will be used for the beginning of the beginning . also for the end of the beginnings , the character will be &quot; used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; this is the case and will be for two shut @-@ up trials for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic single @-@ start plate can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be replaced .
it can also be used in case of specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ically or French ) , so that German or French can be used . there are also many more languages available .
in case of shift shift ; inputs , &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , you can only take a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
p@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile in a tables ; the current line with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelli@@ gently enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under settings ; add ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users like to arrange the columns in tables and equ@@ ile all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to add this . even if this tab@@ ulator is not the addition to the next tab@@ ulator , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code completion , this was still expanded in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three are working on request and the other two are available for all different modes under settings K@@ ile ... complete set .
when we start a new environment using the \ \ &apos; command { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the track button is removed , the last letter of input will be removed , and thus , it will be the most important input list . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink by further letters .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be set up at choice of a command . alternatively , it is a simple jump to these positions using editing , jumping stamp , and can be applied to this positions .
underneath k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists . it can be made possible with different types of knowledge for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as maps of the general language used .
the command mode is not surprising as a few letters with \ \ &apos; s . on the other hand , there will be a large list with environment commands to be entered . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode can be used for deep@@ ening environments .
automatically re@@ plen@@ ish the surroundings of the surrounding area or the key element of Alt + switch button , and it appears \ \ &apos; . after that , the environment can be continued on a simple way and will be termin@@ ated by using the input of the input .
after this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list@@ less environment , even a first \ \ item command is inserted .
under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists . this mode uses the aspect of the required mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .

for example , the letter L is entered and the word force mode has been initiated or the key element C@@ tr@@ l + Alt empty space is replaced , the code L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .

the graphics can be positioned as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for outdoor purposes and new@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is applied , the pages will be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ Tools re@@ arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
in order to receive the result of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the volume creation , creating converting and creating a view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed via Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command , a viewer is normally called to comp@@ ile a viewer . if there should be an integrated viewer , a new window will be opened every time .
a new project is about the project of the new project .... to the following information , the following information will be asked :
when starting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the application of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical Lei@@ ste .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
first , it must be said that the development environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of veget@@ ative packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to under@@ take the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . there are a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for search for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the finding the right document is not always easy . as a variety of help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all of &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and includes a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ ated advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or bu@@ zz@@ ling . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

the plug @-@ in , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; possibly little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you may not wait until someone can benefit the certainty in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can use the plug @-@ in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ in can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a node , we begin with the plug@@ ins Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; ELE@@ MENT therein :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with one another . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves as a unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who he is . this happens by sending the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as presses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will appear fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of their own identity are important for news and comments . see further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader if something specific is happening . see in further information .
event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project happens . an example would be able to record the opening of the opening and closing of a message that later , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S , once they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog Di@@ alog@@ es can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the list of selected address data . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project director . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are specific comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the text context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by experimental text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , role played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project leaders should be given the respective range or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ scale , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : make the notes invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by DT@@ D @-@ induced and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts .
the settings are available via the menu menu . only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a ... to be called . this dialogue extends over some sites that are treated according to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding Tags including car complet@@ es , it can be changed . entries are :
large / small figures from tags : large / small @-@ scale payment of automatic tags . normal large / small @-@ scale means that tags are added as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / minor changes of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / small @-@ scale means , the attributes are added as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags include : if attached , is optional for tags that is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
non @-@ optional tags automatically shut up : as above all the other tags , except for simple tags .
upgra@@ ding and end @-@ day automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of the centr@@ alized characters into the corresponding code during the single run .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . through the standard , default en@@ cores can be restored .
standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with opening open files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ looked ) , but this setting is used by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . but this setting is used by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copy , so in case of a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document of this backup file . this is not the same as the file format . also for non @-@ stored documents a backup regularly , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in editing area or its own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview , and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back in the next start is useful if the user interface through changing the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views are come through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages will be used to control the possibility of war@@ nings by lawyers of not more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the default behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source @-@ view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the image of Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structure @-@ tree the following action is possible to change the structure of the structure with the mouse cli@@ ffs .
in the field of structural @-@ tree settings the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically in the tree , which is set to be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , where there is no element found in the current document .
the area for loc@@ ating abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folding for more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s , this means a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best @-@ known &amp; Cond@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following plug @-@ ins must be stated :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it &apos;s not on a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
entry : this information is delivered to the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to be denied . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is correct . then choose the store , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as of version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger , as well as the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables different implem@@ ent@@ ations on plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debit plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the options below the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of supervised variables . normally , it appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the bottom dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as seen in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger . usually appear in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger is necessary , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ s . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a de@@ bug that must not be respected in the normal case .
the equivalent to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the lu@@ gs to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to run a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
does the de@@ bu@@ gger begin to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the monitored variables as well as the current line is going on . if this happens when the script is continued , the script will continue , the script will start with the requirement .
does the de@@ bu@@ gger start to begin with the execution of the script , without sending information , and the current line number . if this happens while a script is done , the execution continues . it happens before a debit claim will begin as soon as a requirement is provided .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or includes .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby it is possible in functions and includes in@@ correctly .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next way , as if the current does not exist .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the audi@@ ted value appears in the vari@@ ance view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to be better .
documentation type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Provi@@ ding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car complet@@ eness and loading rooms . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ languages and family 2 , the script language and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two types of file types , the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files are handmade , symbol@@ ise the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created hanged ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about transformation .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and contents of the Feat@@ ures@@ ome ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool bars allow a quick insert of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder wear the name of the license language and version , such as available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is in simple ways .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains no one element type via itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the meeting class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only be mentioned for each attribute . in addition , it contains the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains additional tags that will be displayed as this attribute shall be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
returns the source codes for the attributes in the tag editors and attribute @-@ tree to the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . d@@ co@@ p @-@ method@@ ological name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; will be used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , one interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only happen for a attribute description . it is a only element @-@ type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute box of a tags within a dialogue . this day may only happen for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be hoo@@ ked and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog up at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us window is to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A window . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check out only at the shop of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; U@@ ber function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be arranged via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . for a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; the following entries should be created :
&#91; general &#93; version = U@@ de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D classification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can set up with settings actions ... created . click on New Action leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion has been assigned to the button . by clicking the user button , a key pin can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the default settings and insert this text inserted in the document &apos;s current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or enter ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start -@@ Dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
the first must be mentioned as the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scripts . sh .
although skilled paths are allowed is to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document the file name is removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the ongoing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only an instance run , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by external script .
parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods described above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; on the default input can be determined , which can be determined in the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally done with this setting .
according to input , the output of the executed application can also be run . there are two types of issue : normal edition , on the default issue . it can be specified , which should be done with the default issue written by the default issue of the selection :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in this case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to use their use , dis@@ able dialog &quot; Day &quot; when available , so you can enable entering the action using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ ics ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ ics ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , you select size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user , click on this tool a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ day in current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the required action . next to the text field is a button , press him .
select the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and put it on other tags , so it is still which gives or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to tool bar , or should it be shared to a better overview of some separ@@ ator into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set out dialog via settings tool bar . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( left above ) for my tool bar . according to the selection of the element that will be added to the tool bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ x@@ ate all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ pedi@@ ted , but your tool bar should be saved in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so on that their tool@@ bar will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
maybe mention men@@ tioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for normal users , the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like to like . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ os@@ itory whether somebody has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to select an existing documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language . then you will need to create the do@@ c@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 2 = Update 1.@@ html func@@ tioned 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = &gt; tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html
the tree is defined by the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = PHP 4.2 Electronic Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Comp@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; md@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the contents section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed in the design of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if the documentation on the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ fet@@ ch _ fet@@ ch _ Array function , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( like this in your file do@@ c@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are certain that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to be proud of the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources may be sent via email to friends , partners or else to whom are sent . at different places there is an email option , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool bar code with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and used for the release , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you will have multiple keys , you may need a look . in the dialog New Resource , the input fields will be filled out ( URL preview can be empty ) and with click of OK the upload will be started .
upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) package ( DT@@ EP ) package , upload tool bar code , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts , can be started .
after downloading of a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems , it can be stopped . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but the creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be needed in the day XML format . there is a simple way to convert a DT@@ D package automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from DT@@ D charging and conver@@ ting a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ tive line : the string of the string in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : when activ@@ ates , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these fundamental concepts we must first familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to accommodate these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all of which is selected as global , in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of ad@@ ministr@@ ators different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be done with particular promotions specially for the files of a certain project . simple , this is the most restricted size . all elements are taken in the folder of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ö@@ g@@ light .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the building views , the boxes with information and the tool bar . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
in order to select a context menu with the right mouse button , to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , other or all boxes , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click to edit the editing area leading to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation , such as basic machining steps ( cut / paste / insert ) , editing the mouse poin@@ ter or open file , if the string is under the mouse poin@@ ter or open a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor &apos;s editor , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want to insert one single day , e.@@ g &amp; lt ; you can insert the data for this straight day . now they can add the data for this just one day . if you want a day that has several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and pier@@ ce . in the presentation of cardboard boxes are available for files , project , pattern templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool which offers &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can then be displayed in the context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web@@ page &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates only for corresponding users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . read more templates .
here you can find information about the script languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project is also working here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , you can send further functions , such as the script to start , edit or merge with email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by pressing an element , the cur@@ sor will be set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ er of the tree .
this tree appears under the other building views . with him , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces are able to change the contents of all the available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document@@ ations site can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the lower end of the window that can be achieved over the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information on each in Qu@@ ant@@ a running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( if there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure this in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other secure and invite !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can adjust a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to get a complete list of options available to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with Star@@ ts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to employ the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it would be an independent , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ! so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; that is to be appropriate &amp; IDE ;
now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers using an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program com@@ press@@ ors they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; expand , without any scrip@@ ting language skills . ( more about it will find them in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for quick web development and has quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details about the detailed documentation is associated with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files which you have opened . this list has changed every time when you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . see in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project approach , will be reported only a mistake .
conver@@ ts in the inser@@ tion of the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; write , so that it is correct and does not understand the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; en@@ coding , which is the correct path to insert special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; s first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches off the block selection . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
search a character string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed used with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and switching of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main sequence . the problem journalist is activated once you replace the structure tree .
displays the symbol old left from the main window . this column allows you to put reading mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will appear in the menu after the file names of the other documents .
opens up a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored in the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available shipping methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have a further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you will find the details .
invites a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in the project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the tool bar code : locally or project .
opens up a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this created only the name . actions must be stored through settings actions or are added to the tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar .
removes a tool bar from the view@@ point . this del@@ etes not from the hard disk . if you don &apos;t delete the tool bar , you will be asked whether you would like to do that .
so you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , that the tool bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where each other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or any other has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own code format .
charging / stri@@ ving of the du@@ ti@@ ties of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the du@@ ti@@ ties of the &amp; DT@@ EP is to be ris@@ ked without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , the shop fails .
this menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently charged tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog box if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent entry tag tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smar@@ ter means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the paste is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the listed menu points . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
choose the syn@@ dic@@ tation mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows , DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document on the basis of selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
immediate switch between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause some time or un@@ pleasant graphics . recommended is the card mode that is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an agreement , the corresponding sub@@ window is enabled .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main base and off .
the changes in this dialogue contain any application which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the Edi@@ tor@@ ch . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate , you can find details .
a dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or adding which can modify the sequences .
this should produce an aid in accordance with the image of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , please find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , according to the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically completed .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can see the server address of the machine to which you want to access any local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ com@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if one leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote user &apos;s adjustment , adap@@ tion will be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standard .
this is the folder in which the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standard .
this allows to include files from local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . if necessary scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be integrated into the main folder of the project . if a project is based on new , not connected .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of cou@@ ches .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can choose the required files by an@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the hem@@ or@@ chens , chambers of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or with the keyboard Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which are re@@ adily ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to top , including files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about projection views .
with this purpose , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . at present , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the button . in , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile , by clicking a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details in details .
in the lower event of event configuration , one can change event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously specified event , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior can not be found at the moment .
to open another project , open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you are asked whether you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you download a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
folders are equally possible , however , the entries are opening and open with ... in the right verb@@ al context menu :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files . see .
allows for removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the core memory and password . this possibility is useful if frequent upload files are needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option does not come in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ load profiles can be uploaded to different server ( or parts of the project ) to different server . editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog :
this is the name of the server where the files are to be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should select &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discre@@ tion . the password will not be read on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming language can be easily seen in clear text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool bars can be loaded , and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this does not only increase productivity , but allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to their own work .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best above the menu tool bar , use and add . adding tool bar is treated below in the adding of tool bar below .
the tool bar and symbols can be set either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a new tool bar can be executed , any tool bar ren@@ ame , or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialogue , which may be displayed if actions on this or other materials are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition , the entries will remove and the action worked that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings Tool@@ bar ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are in essential documentation , code @-@ cuts and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates in principle as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any on the system existing directory in the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you are presented to the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . some examples are displayed in the storage room under global templates . further information about templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document@@ aries . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple report for the purpose and organiz@@ es work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is supposed to be inserted in the documents , but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates . you are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File Report as a local template .
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . watch in the storage room under project facilities .
select text in your document and store your selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay down onto the man@@ ure templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only copy into one template folder . you can use all file management functions for it , such as pulling and transfer or inser@@ ting across the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder or in the project file size view to a folder on the right and secure Site template . by default , the project folder will be saved , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project conditions permit a very targeted approach , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; shape , add files or link with them . in addition , you can add some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above explained .
to specify the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu characteristics . the following dialog appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed as soon as El@@ ter@@ restrial attributes is extingu@@ ished .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders . if a regular file would be set to dis@@ able , unless they are explic@@ it activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be found in a regular file .
allow earlier or subsequent text for templates in this folder . this could be general head @-@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head lines / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show , right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from a place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaced the source editor into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that is &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to edit the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ cer of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is not necessary to edit the source editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously is enabled . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the button re @-@ transfer the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a .... After choosing V@@ PL ; in addition , it can be adjusted between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is required : a small span for fast machine and a large span for slow computer .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing features are possible , so as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is created as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or remove . one click into the list allows the change of the content , such as keywords on the column name and keywords key wor@@ d@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of looking out pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change about the list is exactly as possible in the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules are still not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style pad by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sors is pec@@ uli@@ ar as in a word Processing , due to arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through single @-@ tap and deleted by back @-@ button or remo@@ del@@ ity .
the Tags is made in the same way as in the source editor , such as in the source editor , is done . it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags previously inserted in existing identical tags is not removed , each other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tool bars like the tables assistant or the list@@ ings are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work must be used in this release , the tables or lists of tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining styles . in contrast to other programs for style , the search for certain elements is possible , and the design of the style can be followed .
to be able to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; need to be compiled except &amp; K@@ DE ; even the lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t libraries , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available in a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the membership changed many changes and simultaneously corrected the entry . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the back@@ log had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be seen differences in line and changes in white characters . later , any amount of further useful functions were added .
if you want to compare text quickly , copy it simply into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost to a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two people are working independently in one piece of co@@ de works and make changes . the original file under the differences @-@ windows enables the resolutions of conflicts and shows the result at the same time . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . the screenshot is available in three qu@@ ell files at mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you include the same and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the options of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often need to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore , if any one changes the inser@@ tion . )
if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folder , then you can complete the ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by using only the file names of the first file . example :
co@@ de@@ 3 folder 2 file diff@@ 3 folder 2 @-@ o target folder K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ o target folder
opening communication enables the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ame , select the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select one of the most opened file from the list . if you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are done with two files .
on the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ ing or merge of folders will be initiated , but if a file is selected , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when merge is crossed , the input field is active for the target and is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately . you can do this step later in saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text items from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . compared with opening , you don &apos;t need to select any files , you can easily close the dialog with the departure button .
you can also use pulling and disman@@ tle : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and leave it over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file like several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would have to be a relatively big effort . you would like to download and compare only two corresponding files , add them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can not get out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; drag the text by text in a compar@@ ision window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse to rest on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three source code readers are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
links to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and commentary , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individuals . )
vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . when the line breaks is activated , the line is represented on broken lines .
the results window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; ti@@ changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next deleted / un@@ resolved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ es are used , any difference can be solved in the same time as a conflict of manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window is marked on the line of the group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump in the position in the windows where the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted in the color background colour for current area and on the left , a black beam appears .
sometimes , through the automatic cl@@ erg@@ ing or through manual editing , no other line remaining in the group ; this text will be displayed in these lines . this text is not displayed in the final file , nor select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you have to copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : if selecting the sources the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with image capture and mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys , right , high , down , page on , page starting from the beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ f@@ law column next to the vertical drive bar can also be used by clicking here .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to do . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ clock mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the links section synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in Section merger and editing the editing window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upwards / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image upwards / C@@ tr@@ l image ) , or the next / previous conflicts also as a conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically shut@@ down into the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful with this option , as you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line @-@ based systems are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ in @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use carriage shut@@ ters \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line files not with , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last used files are automatically stored in the end and restored to the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with solid width . ( on some systems , the dialog can also choose text in variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected scrip@@ ture does not support this display , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be tested . on these systems the button settings automatically produces an un@@ necessarily color .
if this option is enabled , the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press entering or press return , the preceding line is automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during the first step you can ignore white characters . the second step is compar@@ es every row . in this step , white signs can not be ignored . also in mer@@ ging , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car drop down &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , other again save only one line @-@ in front @-@ side comparison , but then they could be treated with different sizes in page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , but if this option is enabled , but if this option must be disabled , however , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis the numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly comes with very large files .
in automation @-@ forward mode , this setting is determined , as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
dis@@ solves automatically all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need time to time , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options will be treated in the chapters to scan folders and perform a merge . check for details under documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already there is an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already one such backup file will be deleted with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , this will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete and restart the change . ( this option is set in K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally on the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , the upper adjustment will be used for all entries .
about the selection fields for the en@@ coding appears a short notice which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file en@@ coding for source files . this influences such as special characters treated and interpre@@ t . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared to different co@@ en@@ coding and be merged .
if you have processed a file , you can define what coding is to be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the process command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output of pre@@ fabri@@ cation command .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a colour@@ less coded transition column . however , you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal running column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the compar@@ ision next to each other or another . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide to transfer the files . current file together in the merge menu will also work if you use only two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it will be delivered to this external command , and not the file itself . in &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly what makes your requirements . for example , you can use this feature or to correct the setup .
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of command is used only when you use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command . the output of the command is only equal to the line . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind the user is to enable more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users don &apos;t want to program that . the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l complete .
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to convert the entry into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to include automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern as needed . the \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another manufacturing command for z@@ eil@@ ing equal to suitable ten@@ tion &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several consider@@ ations at once . then you can use sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the results from each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ S / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and maintain . further operations only change the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ pre@@ processor is the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences are hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and will destroy important data in the worst case .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files . for this reason , you can compare and perform complete folder with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... for each object a suggestion to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows simul@@ ated changes , without having to perform it ,
... provides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of single files . you must only open files on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during reading the folder you can read a small news window via the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when the scanning is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be folded together by clicking on the + / - click or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions , fold and fold all the sub@@ directories with which you can open all folder .
if you click on a file , the file extension is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane in the selected object . in such a case , the merger @-@ action cannot be selected automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the above picture is used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as the same as your entire content is identical . then , we also have the same color . in folders , the age is un@@ significantly for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A exists , del@@ eting the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the interaction can not be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the interaction can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it targets have been specified . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that they are both folders identical . if required for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not the same : mer@@ ging and save the result in both folder . ( the user looks as a visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. While such mistakes cannot be removed , the merge cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , a file is taken after the other . it &apos;s status column indicates whether the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages if something unexpected should be completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is OK .
if in the setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative method of Full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or ode ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the coll@@ ateral actions ( also in all sub@@ folder ) you can run the interaction .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a target folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as a target when using two @-@ file interaction , B and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
in order to bring together all entries : select directories in directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key pin ) . in order to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to conflic@@ ting file types , still invali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , simul@@ ating and break down .
select Sim@@ ulate If you want to see what would happen if you really want to change any changes . you will then receive an exhaus@@ tive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( merge one single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are done with a file , select re @-@ continue directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , continues to continue his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages , allowing you to try out the problem of the problem , or to solve the problem@@ atic entry . thus , you have the option to solve another action on entry or to solve the problem in other way before you proceed with mer@@ ging .
if some entries were individually taken together , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not run together with all entries earlier . even if the interaction were ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be done as a result . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re@@ merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified pattern will be displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ tree . you can split the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default : * . folder do not need to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the Elem@@ ental tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the Elem@@ ental tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignore files that are ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ sch generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be specified specifically using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files are a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
links to folder : if the option is switched off , the links like normal files are treated and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to yourself would lead to an end @-@ off loop and crash@@ es down ; ) This option is shut down in default .
execute a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ il@@ ateral , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders beyond a slow network , it is possibly faster to compare only changing date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain degree of safety . please use caution . this option is dischar@@ ged in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality &apos;s change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . that can be useful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ et date . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is posted in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because the other file is not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is posted in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , the original version is changed with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also delete the normal interaction of single files , not just the merge file . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view remains visible above the merge file ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can turn off the window frames on the window menu and turn off through changing between directory &amp; text window , between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , you can also download a single file from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be closed , and the file will not run once again , when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost if you read the directory : directory menu : new reading
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of Ki@@ o @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an ft@@ p server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ .@@ or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters have to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank , &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then there &apos;s always a file as link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions , or change of change . therefore , the permission is possible , or the change date from the original . ( note this option is only possible for local files ) .
the main purpose of purpose is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first to start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part displays from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part file , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file .
in the quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . also , please note that this does not work properly , if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now is the compression ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve used GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by using in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone the way or get it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script for the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find further information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be classified as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be identical as identical . i@@ F similar lines ( next to Each other , this would this place finish this would be the case .
the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is necessary , however , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it is too much effort to design extra a file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; published and the text can not extingu@@ ish . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to create differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confused and dis@@ missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .

only differences : files that are identical in all orders are not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to read about changes to these options with the updates on up@@ dating . )
only entries are displayed , the differences feature . this also includes that identical files are not included in the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merger . ( the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version . ) This option is posted in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already available , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
default in default , this option is de@@ activated . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the work@@ spaces , to stop her size or move it . this works both within a desktop and in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even move on desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . however , there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the application minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and beam . the commands are the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of desktop . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on a application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on a application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will appear ; the name of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
check this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are shown together with its name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ates , &amp; eg ; 1 . mind .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some other Windows applications appear ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row and ver@@ tically in a vertical series , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display windows as symbols or with its content . moreover , it runs out of the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by switching from switch switch ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
do not open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t need to apply or apply to your system administrator . in this file you need to use the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and provide this one value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding into new functions . it is optim@@ ised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag ; the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged range of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the enlargement window is an enlarged range of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a movable micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can use a selected screen area in the enlargement window ( plate mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with arrows and bri@@ ga@@ ze and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can shift the contents of the enlargement system and move it with the arrow keys .
in addition to the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the select window is firm , and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; kiss ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stop the up@@ dating of the page . the up@@ dating of the up@@ dating means that the required CPU time is against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Straight , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same position as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is due for a while . it is intended to help people suffering the RS@@ I syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive G @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people suffering the re@@ peti@@ tive strain In@@ dies ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and each mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse , and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may cause pain that are linked with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done .
to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent using the mouse , it is used against pain that may be used because of the use of the mouse , it may be us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may fall differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click , once you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent understanding is activated , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after the pressing of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can run the bri@@ ga@@ ze by pressing a mouse button . this mode requires a little exercise , but you get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it quickly .
this delay time must be clo@@ aked after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
if it is switched on , the shift field is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting for the mouse button , before the mouse button is reset , if there is no evidence of the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now is enabled by clicking button shift . this function is activated , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . this movements are stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt file ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can turn &amp; K@@ DE ; to move the reaction time . open the sound system and click here the Rider General . there &apos;s a sliding sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please find the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program .
sets all settings to the values back when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button Apply , the settings will be reset on the status after the last pressures of applic@@ ators .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the default settings . in particular , the smart motion should first be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later go to the smart motion .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; K@@ DE ; at speeds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which doesn &apos;t link to un@@ wanted reactions . therefore , you can use the mouse to such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse goes , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually quite easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if it &apos;s just a shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean ; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists , that you can run a mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor up to place where you want to make it . but par@@ don &apos;t let the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make a key click on a neutral area . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover @-@ line of windows .
I try to work with the smart motion , but I don &apos;t create it to edit the lyrics .
the smart motion is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you handle it . it is very well possible to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move to any other action , where you want to move the mouse with supp@@ ressed mouse button . but there will probably be some problems to prepare . here are some advice :
do not use the smart phone if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; check out the text instead of a mouse click on the end of the text area while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always be played every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played by sound like a mouse click . so you can also use the intelligent Ver@@ push button . later you can also use the intelligent mouse click without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you need to install the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter briefly confused . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and those who have been suffering from the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that a certain period is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , pulling and lay out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can talk with the dum@@ b user their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can allow dum@@ b user to speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk game sentences , which should be spoken once again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left ) , enter the command , which will later be used for the language issue of text . further details will be found in the description of the introduc@@ tions dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text password book . you can often choose text password , without you need to type . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ istics . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are taken into the Wor@@ ter@@ istics .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly visible and basically includes an input field for key moments of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in the screen ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
if you &apos;re k@@ mouth ; correct , you can input the sentences you want to hear . each written sentence is attached to the expi@@ ration memory . you can choose from these sentences , which should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings the mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialogue contains two card cards , speech output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ istics and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the map language , enter the command to call the language name . in the select field under the input field you specify the character en@@ coding , with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text will be transferred to the language generator as default .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course the command is related to the speech output from your language generator . this command is found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are shown below .
with possible s@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for speech output . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first select box action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action through the keyboard or the choice of a text passage in the text password book or in the Lei@@ ste for Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ ücher is triggered .
with the selection of so@@ aring , the selected text passage is also spoken directly , and additionally added to the input storage . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection field , you can define the text box for text password book , if the text password book will be stored automatically when closing the editing device .
with the selection of text password book , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the text password book will not be saved . choose Before Save , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook is to be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ istics site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ lds . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this select box , you can select the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ lds .
with the buttons on the right on the site you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to export the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and select language for the dictionary .
choose the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert just correct words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then what dic@@ tion@@ aries should be merged , and how these weights are to be exposed .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window is divided into two sections . in the upper part , the text can be displayed as a tree structure .
in the bottom part you can select an selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard guide . if you select a textbook book , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books add or select text @-@ pass@@ ages and books can either be accessed either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ up menu .
you can change the order of text password or text matching with the mouse to the new spot , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button change .
the selected text will be cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise , the selected areas of the delay will be used .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise , the selected areas of the expi@@ ration device is used .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of the run run .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shift tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the shi@@ fted left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bodies in the bottom part of the main window with Hin@@ ts over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a later@@ ally folding box with entries are displayed directly under the tool bar directly under the tool bar . by clicking on the shr@@ u@@ ed left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
you probably have the order for the speech output not properly or not fully entered . open Settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the instruction for voice speech on the card language edition . ( see configuration dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
the Edinburgh University is a language edition system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ z are supported . the license allows you to use festival free and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in folder / usr / local / festival . the command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language edition , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in folder / usr / local / fre@@ ys . the speech output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be subscri@@ bed as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ eme into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in ph@@ on@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in ph@@ on@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ st and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is like to ad@@ ore the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the full command is to be used as in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the data as default input must be switched on .
the speech @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . he uses modules to support various language versions .
since the voice of the language only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use a s@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust .
for setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; kiss ; successful , you need a voice generator ( and , of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to allow text through the calcul@@ ator . a list is already stored in a list that can always re @-@ release the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth has no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the calcul@@ ator , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( specify either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Connectivity ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; - the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a service of existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for language edition ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with its T@@ TS capabilities . users also offers interesting opportunities for users .
read texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; immer@@ sed in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is embedded .
the language edition is performed by the programme of speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; used .
allows to generate language editions in command line ( or with shell script ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; program program .
in future : support for speech @-@ market @-@ market languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ market @-@ met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech @-@ service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; can be read entirely or partially with the text file .
in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the K@@ DE Acc@@ essibility mailing list . subscribe to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ box / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility . you can also find the developers at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; you must install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
when the first start of kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card card is displayed . see also .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that are in volume or speed . you should also specify several variants for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you should also specify a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ats ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard equipment .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to multiple printers in the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ card spokes@@ man in t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed automatically . this appears automatically when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no spokes@@ man is set up .
all speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for the speech output when an application is not prescribed .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of the speaker in the list is also determined its priority .
click on one of these buttons to contact your changes on the running &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
here you choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls .
if you click here , the new speaker is based on the card speaker . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; already almost use . go back to the card card general and check whether voice output is dis@@ able ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , that &apos;s the T@@ TS service of &amp; K@@ DE . see now . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; please click on the board card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language recording system of &amp; K@@ DE . click on the card card reader to open this card card . here you can set some general options here .
mark this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ats ; system to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text records and read text orders . see . remove the selection , will de@@ activate K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; K@@ DE .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; continue to activate the field language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box marks and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break , pause and record .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on Apply or OK , then all changed at@@ titudes are taken on all sides .
the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ats ; runs first , and select the text , read and select the text menu tools . after a short time the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ voltage and other invisible brands are also available .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ats ; runs first , and select the text that will read , and select the text menu tools in the main menu .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you notify you of noti@@ fiable events . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ats ; read it .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various kinds of messages . for example , you can be noti@@ fied if you arrive at an IR@@ C channel , where your nick@@ name comes first . with &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry messages in the Settings menu of the program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter on the string replacement is a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ats ; it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the news that can send K@@ mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ats ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ats ; filter is not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before it is sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the works of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn up all of the other orders and will hold these orders . if the output of the Screen @-@ Reader is read , orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings are the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next door priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . during you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications which uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no special dr@@ ink@@ ability .
all four of the orders are shown in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one of them reads , this output will be stopped and finished .
first you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
edit the text and give it to the next filter . at the moment there are three kinds of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
replacing parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts may be delivered either as words or regular expressions . it is provided with pre @-@ defined list of character filters such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ats ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
you can send orders depending on the text of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages . read it about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language issue . if the filter is established that his rules are not applicable , he will continue to keep the text in the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent them by all activated filters , which were set up on the side down . processing is done in the order in the list of top to bottom .
this shows the list of common normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be moved from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and there will be the further introduc@@ tory di@@ alogs below .
for the establishment of character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than compar@@ ative pattern . if these samples are found in the text , the text will be exchanged with the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ slip will not be regarded as comparison .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the shown order from above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , save the current list or delete . download a list of a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker for the text order is one of the listed languages here . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also choose multiple languages when you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is listed here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can use the program q@@ d@@ bus with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be bl@@ asted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is available , you may only enter .
the character set filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box type filter should be specified . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string of character filters uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. The words must be limited by divi@@ ding character ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Select &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; you can find out in am@@ big@@ u@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such drives . it can only be applied to your system . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also available .
with the Speaker filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define that text of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ats ; there is a text to the filter , is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties , which is selected by the text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; sends , and the properties that are selected on the card @-@ card spokes@@ persons , you can transfer the chosen actors .
if a value is listed here , the filter is used if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; template , you can claim this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to accum@@ ulate the regular expression on the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of your talk . if the text is fulfilled above the filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the same button . click on the button to show the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your language settings , or delete all settings .
the Spre@@ ader filter is applied only then on the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box type filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the speech API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ats ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of speech API of &amp; K@@ DE ; you will find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

text of the text to read and option : language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give .
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not read .
due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not need to use this voice . you also need to make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or interpre@@ tations seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole movements will be ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sh . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the option is set on the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , may these possibly be fixed by a character set filter . see .

KT@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched onto the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ats ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developer team in connection .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ats ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment from K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can download and install the tar@@ ball from the source code , and install the program with the following commands :
before you &apos;re using &amp; kt@@ ats ; first , check first if a speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this purpose you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; who uses the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is said to be developed so that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is distor@@ ted into individual pro@@ positions . the user can carry out , repeat , hold or break the output .
if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ats ; for example , if you have set up a female speaker for the output . if you choose one speaker , whose language is English and whose family is female , otherwise it will automatically select the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; a spokes@@ man will see you in after .
if you click on the map of the card , and to edit a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card card setup is displayed . as an example , the module is displayed for Festival Interactive . for example , you will find details on the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the text code for text that will be handed over to the festival . in general , this setting will be made automatically . generally speaking , western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regulator and display this grey , the voice can &apos;t be chosen from you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up any speakers ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is marked , when starting the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system range , once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to keep the reading or to control any other .
here are all orders in the queu@@ e , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just working sentence . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID .
with the buttons in this row you can select sat@@ two in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .

on this map card you can set special actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processed four types of language contracts :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn up all of the other orders and will hold these orders . after the output of the Screen @-@ Reader has been read , orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings are the next group priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning holds the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you prefer &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website you can watch with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or copy of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ats ; the audio output to the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory news .
the settings on this card card only apply for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can begin text in single sentences , as only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order . thus , you can also stop or cancel all text files , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this directly .
here , you will see the set @-@ on detection filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ats , you will automatically set up a pro@@ posi@@ tional control filter . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional processing filters , but will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
at the easiest way you will learn to select the device selection selection . turn on the box selection , change some properties , and check how the selection of the talk is changed . of course , you have to set out more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then you can begin with reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block which can take very long ,
you can then keep text orders on the card card orders or ab@@ ort , even if the language syn@@ thesizer cannot support this function .
for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . it cannot be switched off , just away . do not change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters compare text with a regular expression of proposition and paste a tab@@ ul@@ atory mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) on the set limits ( table characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard cross @-@ border filter is re@@ tains the character set .
S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( farms ) , war@@ nings , news , or the output of screen re@@ funds .
if you have removed the normal proposition cross @-@ level filters , you can add this again by replacing the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .

mark this check box , if the property should have priority before other features . you can also set several markings here .
as the language is a critical factor at the understanding of the output , it will always be used as a primary feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language if you want to specify a certain application text in a different language as the specified in the working environment .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ats .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with Festival . would you like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions regarding the transmission .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management interface , the rout@@ ines and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; be started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device does not display and allows setting the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed with installing and installed . networking devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded through the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this system tries to automatically detect the used platform at the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the suspension selection is offered . it is the platform made from the list that will not meet the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . through marking the setting non @-@ once @-@ qu@@ ire the definition can be taken permanently . when the next start of the network settings will then select this selection automatically .
the change of network settings are possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are shown , changing the settings can only be viewed , changing the button mode mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password required .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the riders network interface serves to manage the network appliances in the system . all available network devices are displayed . all the available network interfaces can be performed in the following tasks :
setup settings can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to expand the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are collected from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information will send all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the select list may be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the manual manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be set up in TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface for boats . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you may notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
networking devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs . roll@@ out of a network device is done through selection from the list and click of interface ....
networking devices can be activated or switched off as required . dis@@ able a activated network device through selection from the list and click on interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ scriptions .
if there is more than a network interface there , the interface must be selected on the web where the gateway computer is selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org lists DNS to this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ esp@@ ace portion of the equ@@ ator solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be converted into a list with buttons or removal in the list using buttons or outputs .
by clicking on the button closure ... from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed in the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button . the entry is then inserted into the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator on the nam@@ ing solution , select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog pane .
the list of particularly well @-@ known machine describes the IP address IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used with boats if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list contains some records , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this still existing version of IP should replace 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host computer , and click adding .... The dialog of New alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and add the button . if the known machine has several alias names , de button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
there can be one of the following tasks , then with click of OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings used in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable changes , must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; K@@ DE is installed and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install the rpm package with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphic surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient ; not , but in addition , development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this area can not replace ongoing knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 never has large spread . of IPv6 , it is expected to pass through the near future . currently , this description is currently concent@@ rating on the common IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator that can be used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP may be used . definitely , the IP address can &apos;t be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose , to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so their any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks most often addresses are used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for IP @-@ re@@ charge .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .

&amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; is an application where you can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for UNIX &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of comp@@ elling tasks and corresponding environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will be available for all users of the system as well as system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded .
in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and below description will be disabled .
the environment variables change the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks except strength . in a de@@ activated variable it appears as a description disabled .
to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . proceed in the menu Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click on the right mouse button and press release menu New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the starting program here . you can specify either a relative or an absolute sc@@ outs . if you want to choose the program first , press out ....
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed on 1 and 15 of the selected months , regardless of the week &apos;s day , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall .
as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only then active when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored .
to cut a job , first select the remote task first . go to processor .
alternatively , you can click on the right button to select and select button , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X .
to copy a task , they first choose to copy the user &apos;s task . then go to edit copying .
alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button on the task and select copying or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to include a task , first must be cut off or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , insert it at all . select the tasks folder . go then to edit .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks -@@ folders and select button , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; V .
to take changes in one task , first choose one . go to the menu Edit Change .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and modify it ... Select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog edit in which you can edit the chosen task .
to delete a task , select the correct task . go to the Edit menu .
to enable or dis@@ able a task , select it , and determine the state with the Edit menu Edit . in@@ active tasks are characterized by in@@ active in their description .
alternatively , you can click on the task and select activ@@ ating the right mouse button . please make sure that program name , parameters and description are displayed correctly .
to immediately carry out a task , select it and then start editing Now .
to create a new environment variable , first select the variable file folder . go to the Edit menu ...
alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button and select New ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the variables . you can also choose one of the list of the most commonly used environmental variables ; click on the arrow next to the box for the Vari@@ abl@@ ames . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the un@@ rest program to another as the normal address
as with the creation of new variables , changes are made only if the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved .

if all tasks and environment variables were entered or changed , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the Save File menu .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or ad@@ ditions to tasks or variables are then active .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; dialog dialog . if you choose out , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard instructions of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use for band@@ aging works on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band . the first target was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take ?
before a volume can be used , it must be kept from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen on three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; do the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the banana . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the repro@@ aches in the band will not be asked whether the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
know &amp; k@@ dat ; the repro@@ aches , looking for the appropriate index on your plate . cannot be found , you will be asked whether the index is to be re@@ created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape was included . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the bank can now be searched for the band .
before throwing the tape , the connection must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the symbol to the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a wra@@ ps must be form@@ at@@ ted before you need to use the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted the form@@ att@@ ing tape before you need to form@@ at@@ ted the band of &amp; k@@ dat , usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape in advance , DA@@ T drives are not used .
after entering the band@@ name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before switching the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can happen on three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the Local File Tree and select File Sh@@ ech@@ es ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the files in record for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files in an entry for the band with a h@@ owl . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the check @-@ in test ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears dialog . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before entering the rest@@ oring , the files , which are to be restored , must be marked with two types :
select one file or folder in one of the archives that belong to entry for the tape drive . it will only be restored the selected file or folder .
mark the required files from one of the archives with a h@@ owl . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
to select a file , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings will be reset . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it refers to the tape file using the tape file using the tape file . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make a safety profile to make the following settings :
the current working folder , in which the f@@ use is to be done . the list of transparent files will be updated automatically according to the required work file .
for any file , which are listed below securing files , the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder which are stored on other file systems , can be used separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
carry out a mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ corporate backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files saved , which have changed ever since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last in@@ corporate backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ w version of the tape menu .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command is attached to the drive . in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat tries to lock the tape drive . maybe this setting is not working with all the band drives .
if the option is switched on , the bond of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat will automatically be kicked off automatically . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ding block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size can be sent to your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band formed , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the file &apos;s content is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is : seconds , whereby the name of the complete name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the ep@@ och , which has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act with mental f@@ uses .
check the content of a backup copy . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer viewer can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows information about your system or where the system allows information about information about problems relating to information on their server .
&amp; ks@@ system log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ system log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information on issues related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , using which the protocol @-@ files can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g ser@@ vers and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and will be explained in the other chapters of this book .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in next chapter of this manual page .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - system protocol has started to open , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have not started using system ver@@ wal@@ nuts . this protocol can usually be found in folder / var / log , for the normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or on the selected string bar . the list of the log @-@ lines will be automatically changed , so that only protocols will be displayed next to the selected filters . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string search engine is included .
you can also select another record , of course , to select another record . in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , select the column process , and use it out in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent from this process or have been created .
this option is enabled in default setting , and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a striking colour than protocol lines of stage . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or on the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . it can then be useful for example if you would like to investigate the output of a particular command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
furthermore , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all the new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ scriptions . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more information about the information sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .

welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program start in &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s why it is easier to use , more powerful , and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not continue to go down historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on system V in@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V in@@ it diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start at the high @-@ drive system or change to another Run@@ level . such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if you don &apos;t want to use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you &apos;ve got something through , then you come to restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it involves a K , the script will be called using the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; can also run a user @-@ level , that is &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eln , or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they move an entry from the range of availability system services .
note : entries are shi@@ fted when you move these into a new range . in order to copy them on a new Run@@ level , you need to select explicitly copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action .
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to include the system service .
note : there are no option to re @-@ produce records that have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . therefore , be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the various working ranges ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection Ober@@ - or below the previous .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . use the tab button by re@@ pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press the Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries will require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings will be saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise , they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise it will be saved in a local c@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine starts up constantly . what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you will need to edit additional files in / etc . please read the details inside the distribution manual .
the species , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but is simplified the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use other distribution files : please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( eg &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after having made changes , you need to save this . either use the corresponding symbol of tool@@ bar or entry saving in the File File .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user group list . to edit the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group features .
some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings . only if you can add limited limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , where shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ forms .
the card password management appears if Shadow passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD UNIX .
this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limited ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters , the limited number of data in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the help of the field file system .
the card groups inform@@ s information about the group &apos;s premi@@ xes of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user , can be found in the field of Pri@@ m@@ ular Group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the big field .
the group features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , add adding the user or group or click on the appropriate adding button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can add the li@@ lo boot manager , remove , remove , and modify the time to add the standard operating system , add the standard operating system , remove , change the operating system , remove , change and more .
