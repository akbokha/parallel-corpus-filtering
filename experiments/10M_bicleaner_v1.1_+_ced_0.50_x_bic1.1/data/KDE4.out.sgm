<seg id="1">The module will translate you in the & konqueror; menu to Extras website. choose from the list of the translation and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, there should not be any major decisions on how to check the translation in advance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites in the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish-Page, where you can insert to transfer the texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & Condor;. despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by which this is easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and in the built-in functions you will find in the Handbook to & Konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror; please select settings extensions.... Open the board card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules from the KDE package; Addons. please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror package before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & Conqueror; then you can view the page, the & konqueror; for the crash, or the list of stormy, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module stored filter (also called the folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar under Extras suit filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current workdirectory on different type of filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & Connectivity; please select Extras DOM tree. and open a new window with the DOM which is currently displayed. as default setting the root notes of the document, for example: this item, all other nodes are subelements of this root nod.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Connectivity; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists of setting up folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. every object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified. according to this way, large files can be easily detected, even if they can be seen far in the folder hierarchy. consequently & FSView may be regarded as a graphic and interactive version of & UNIX; command is considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; one entry in the Treemap-representation is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. to simplify navigation, the right corner of colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on color mode, can be either depth for the light detection of wear letters or mapping a different file names as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, if enough space is available, only if enough space is present or whether the surface of subordinated rectangles is supposed to occur (whereby the relative position may occur by the character of the Treemap). additionally, you can define the relative position of labelling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">Regarding treatment algorithms for Treemaps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. if the Treemap in & FSView is not always available, this setting will not always be available. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As distribution of an entry into the subordinate entries, the implementation remains to be left. here, it is intended for the labelling and to avoid disclosure of space-loss due to the scope as possible. the best methods of this regarding are lines, columns or recursive second healing.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal space for one entry on the menu entry. instead, a copy pattern in the area of the parent was shown to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was originally intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, which was developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="57">Although & digiplug; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion by libraw, DNG-Export and ICC-color management.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; on the camera or lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE; programs is also & digiarrived; an open source project. that means it is based on the support of Endangling. you should therefore report problems and improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digiarrived; try to make use of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you use this link, your web browser opens a page in error message system. all necessary information is already registered here. please follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digiarrived; is a project supported by a community. if you have a regular user of & digiarrived; you can ask you questions to other users of & digiarrived; you can soon answer questions about other users. in this mailinglist there will be English speaking, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & digiarrived; too.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digiarrived; registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for report in the developer mailing list of & digiarrived;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you want & digiarrived; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote file. simply click on the folder symbol folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the databnk is stored. this path remains equal to all picture folder.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add a lot of folders like you would like to add. & digiarrived; you will also use allocales settings.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the images, as base folder. & digiarrived; looks every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. during the passage of the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiarrived; durations recursively exclude the Bibliothekspad in its whole depth. you cannot exclude any subfolder, unless you add an extraordinary file. this allows you to add an point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take a existing folder with photos as basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist don't have photos as symbols. you can change it by clicking on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album symbol. for more details, see the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configured the base folder, you can setup your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my records and My Keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Rohdateisupport: if you use the rough mode of your camera, so & digiarrived; possibly deal with the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of Rohkamerasupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to setup and work with raw files are described in the sections Roh-Decodersettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera equipment is provided, so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system, with & digiarrived; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission to the computer. the connection can be realized as a turntable. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiarrived; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which is a constantly increasing number of digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of digital cameras to host computers and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos are slowly decomposed and transfers over the serial port is slowly. & digiarrived; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libg22 must have been created with librixif support, the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camera tools. if the EXIF support is not present in libgphoto2, you may possibly be able to be able to see, or the creation may be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digiarrived; it is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Project (manual) is a approach to develop a common module structure for & digitised;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way. their advantage is that it is much easier to add & digiarrived; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in & digiarrived; self conducting.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + rotation speed + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">The drag and lay of images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the universe, via the horizontal separator line or in another application window. the only limitation is that you can't select a picture in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to make the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies, and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filtern is displayed on the file name only if this ind the symbol view is also displayed. which fields will be displayed in the dialog for the Albenz settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; presents an organized view on your photo albums. these albums can be stored in a single albumtree. these albums can be stored on the folder, in which the album was first created, sorted by the album, first in the properties of the album. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will not need to find a specific photo. if you don't know how many photos you have, then you will not use & digiplug;. the approach to store metadata is guaranteed in a database as well as in the image files, you can easily access to other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you want to do something into your system. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether other access to your photos are to be stored or on a network drive & etc; please note that you need to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly on the same location. if you have enough photos, then you'll be able to use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc.. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant intake of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will then do not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the adata side of the metadata in & digiarrived; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what would like to change? a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes are available. of course, these are the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should select any photo keywords, labelling and evaluation. of course, you can select all images that can select the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos on the top photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now proceed with wise, keywords, like to proceed with other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import a catalogical images from another source of embedded sample, then & digiarrived; automatically add the images to the right spot. the setting of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving a sub-tree to another one. the changed keywords are updated by & digiarrived; updated throughout the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filename and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalogues your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to let most don't let your photos look, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this to the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! you can hear about dreaming, associations, the historical period of time is back, you may even hear the silence. the labelling has changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to be the meaning of the viewer, to help Him about the motive that she has moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect, if it is the strength only with a lettering for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiarrived, you can save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), when you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time. if you want to export your pictures into Web galleries, then these labels will tell you about your wishes and / or the title of the Web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by Geolocalization are already somewhat narrowful and will be able to repeat that one day, in the near future, you can also download the photos on the admission site. you can also export the pictures at the recording venue. however, you can also export the photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and signifies the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all amended versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the alignment site of & digiarrived; as information stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for actor and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has been created, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can't be changed. according to this value, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for Constitutional Court): associated with the author. this field contains the review of the photographer. examples of this field can be titles as: employee photographer, Free photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is a comment on the car field, it must be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the access field to identify the photo. if the photographer wants to be listed here. if the photographer wants to be listed below. if the photograph is shown here, you can see the picture below. if the picture is a picture photo, then the group / agency shows the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't have any protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calculator, delete or change. the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique. & digiarrived; will provide a module for the handling processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnouts, turnouts, power plugs, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterect, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs which lost on the road or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative. in this section there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data production company, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, this cautious will need to get more difficult than a few years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs to get more expensive. there are offers about Gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you believe this is in your erequator area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good recording. the best DVD recording systems are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much reliable. it's about choosing the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you were just written. therefore, they use a control flow mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a favorable program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and Linux; it's still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged diskettes, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn it slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriately format. read the media using a description, date & author license and then store on a clean, dark dry and on animals protected site. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read the latest hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppies retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing guaranteed include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms by hard drives: disererror study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error cause, SMART can not notice this error. some of the SMART terminates the error. this is especially readers and publishing counter. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to excess voltage. of course, you can also produce data loss due to a power outflow before you have saved the files, but these losses are usually able to restore any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make lots of power, this can take heavy damage with computer chips and high-speed measurement. these can cause serious damage. at your calculator, these anomalies can cause damage, damaged motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs any part of the energy heat and retains the rest. however, it is normally available in the form of a plug-bar. however, remember that not any plug-bar also contains a stress protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he offers the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that he protects against lightenment and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers also provide a phone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for the move.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctuations in the electricity pipes, it will not really help you. even a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically shut down their data and run the system. some models allow them to be sure that they get the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare it for less than & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be protected for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected. at the end, you should always remember any cable before you ride into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup goal for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar costs; 75 per year and 400 GB costs €500. moreover, you need to send the data about comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services to be limited to 1 GB. your free memory is limited to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will get unlimited memory which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very safe. data transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. thus, they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are due for transmission errors. the file system and btrfs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you don't have a photo. it's quite worrying that there is no protection to your computer. nobody seems to have thought of this. no one seems to have thought of this. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable mains are a further source for transfers, since they create interferences within the data stream. these errors remain unnoticed by normal file systems.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly concerned about transfers problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with record players on low level and can be scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux. read this article in english.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an initiative with his btrfs file system. this is still using the alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses in the notebook and 46% for job systems. in notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft and newinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the spread file systems. a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the research process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and a undefined status is avoided. if a file wasn't completely stored before the problem entered, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go to the direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and the final appearance. even DSLR cameras have the optimum effect for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a high-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You'll get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro. so, don't make anyone involved in any data loss. so, you will secure your data frequently after a plan and test these backup before you do anything dangerous as the reinstalling your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash suggests, you are lucky if the drive was not connected during the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. don't forget aircraft disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and thief, are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastervorous always means a local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said, a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are supposed to be secured. it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup. generated a complete moment of time to two time points: the complete securing and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incorporate backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. this is generated several moments. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is only checked and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer files, you can only change the difference of files that really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer, on DVD or another opic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment should happen manually after you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent pictures and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual appliances,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures of the next 40 year survival, that is approximately the time period in which you truly are interested in you because they are reminded of your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable because of its nature, everything is said to be careful with caution and re-rate the time. unfortunately, there's no other possibility as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuse technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go from which you have set up the scalability and the area you want to have placed on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and turn it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC and dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resili2fs / dev / sadc1 # modify the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software that can read it, then you can create this yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which appears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. the downside, is that it requires relative many administration information but not as many as TIFF and recommend a slow compression. this format we want to save you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compressionism (Deflate). however, you can easily store your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed-free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required for use of metadata. a handful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a combination of XML and RDF. it is a combination of XML and RDF. the file information are stored in a file itself. the extension & quot; .xmpquot; is stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can be found separately on the link between the metatendatei and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and lay down everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. among the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightened efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures of the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera editing, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive processing, you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digiarrived, you should add the metadata once again. these were cut off by other programs under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it then in Webgaleries, code in MPEG, use in contact details, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiarrived. in section adding a picture to an album you can find a description as you see photos that you already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings for importing images to your nighttime bench.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these with the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and turn off. another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to take a while with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator will appear on the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras don't display any thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photo information stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer. note that for some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS and the image. these information are the same as with the metadata side bar of the main window of & digicame; or picture editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, click the button to download and then download the pictures of their camera into one single album in & digiplug; in downloading the photos will not be deleted, before you delete the pictures safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the button for downloading & KDE. once you selected the button, use the button to download and then selected the button. the button Selected is dazzing as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have not yet been downloaded from & digiarrived; in this case the new pictures are downloaded with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the buttons, select a dialog box where you can select the target album, where the list of existing records will be sorted out, as normal files are sorted. details of the existing records can read in the section my records. then select the destination from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiarrived; invites photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all of them on a button by deleting the button Delete. if you want to delete a few, you need to delete it first and then delete the delete selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore images from the camera. so you should not check out whether the photos are successfully deleted, if you want to delete the photos in a & digiplug; if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete the camera image, you should do this about the camera level, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use the file name as filename. normally, the file names will normally be reset, after the photos are deleted from the camera, if you can download photos of different recording studios in the same album, so it can be useful, the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and reflection of the picture and date-based subscriptions. if you use this latter option, will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos stored on the record. the first two are related to the information about the author in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time to correct all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to read another file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the option date & time. for more customizations you should read the help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiarrived; for a photo is indicated below the name, which will display the camera in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiarrived; can use any information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording, to perform an automatic rotation during the heart rate. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section side bar adata you can read more details, about the information that embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the button and select the automatic rotation at the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has made information about the date where the photo was made, & digiarrived; this underscores are based on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same album. in the section sidebar Meta-data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually disabled, and in this case, & digiarrived; the photos directly in the destination album. if you want to change this option, use the button to add, and select the button based subalps at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their calculator on their camera is the button to download. select the file extension dialog & KDE; you can also select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiarrived; you, where the images should be uploaded to the camera. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to delete the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to make an area through automatic recording of the GPS data to cartographers. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten your photo, where exactly the picture was done, you can send a postcard to another & digiplug; if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug, or simply want to document the place of photos, it is well enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has supported many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle, and card referrals. there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and last more than manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera running a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the GPX format as this is the only format which is supported by the module to geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from images and the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the presigns of hairless coordinates which are created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiarrived; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings to access the behaviour of & digiarrived; setup in the menu settings. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select promotion can display on embedded preview or image editing. specify the default behavior of & digial; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data will be automatically selected in the respective IPTC data fields if the option is selected from the camera interface. this data is also written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the editor: this field should contain the photographers name of the photographer, as a photographer photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a further description of the car field, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author, then this organizations should be entered here, then the group or agency should be listed here, then the group or agency should be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC rim. this ensures that the metadata is constantly contained in the image and not only in the database of & digiarrived; this metadata is also available other programs and can be imported into & digiplug; imported without being lost without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labs as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG Images: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the pictures embedded in the pictures. please note: when pictures, which are already labelling, these can be overwritten by the & digiarrived.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse pointer will rest on a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats. to specify which file types & digiarrived; you can list the file extension of this list and remove any file in a & digiplug; albumordner, which has no of these extensions, has been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset, by pressing the button updating right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lighthouse & digiplug; can be set on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have shown different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size ladyquot; if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select this here. you can turn the toolbar when using image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this image can be set with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia at the nearest explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires an lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF files can be compressed with the TIFF-files option. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the defect-algorithm uses.</seg>
<seg id="299">You can save the losses of loss-free JPEG 2000 files. even if you select the loss of losses, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata was still not supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default setting is that all green pixels are equal to sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixel at odd lines. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option gives the image a little soft, eliminated but the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white rottle of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white is not set off. standard is to use a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the effect has the effect that underlining images in four steps more details in the shutter. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shear, so the parts of your pictures are burned down to look through the inability of your camera, due to the inability of your camera, you can create a few unusual results, as they can reconstruct the shlichter in various Rosatönen. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top light.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally not be filling as fast as green and red. & digicraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red proportions of the still saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Use the luminance value for your taste. you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this may also be made later in the image options of the & digiplug; -image processing can be made. in order to keep the time for Demosaicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-filtered image sensor that features many cameras and which is a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiarrived; and Dcraw are available to you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces color acts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour slides of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a colouring correction, as you have performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information like the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviouring behaviour is opened when an image is opened / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Click here to delete the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you find all your profiles. & digiarrived; examines this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to rear. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures of color administrated not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model which you can use. not all profiles are created on the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not have any color mapping or Gammakortur. currently, dcraw Gamma does not need for conversions at 16-bit depth. this means you must carry out the tone mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options such as the soft-proof profile, which you can emulate how your printer can be returned from a device as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very satisfied, instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obvious which color profile is designed for them for what is planned for. unfortunately, there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the purpose: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portrades and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image viewing and image processing is supported; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want, and these will then be downloaded from & digiarrived. these modules are displayed as new entries at the main menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortage of tasks that are carried out by modules, can be set under settings in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) on KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI Project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper knocking is adjusted the time between the entrances, usually are 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes turn off the metadata one or from which are embedded on the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features indicate a list of all cameras supported on the left side. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is connected to the computer. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is connected to the computer. currently, serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage are currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have chosen a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / access, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you will need to connect the camera with your computer, put them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digiarrived; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camerodell and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; Pictures in Mülleimer view, you can set the conversation of & digiarrived; you will find a look at the delete pictures of an album. in the sections of an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be disclosed, if you use the changes in the right sidebar without any review. otherwise, you will need to store the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also adjust the display of the Welcome screen & digiplug; in the start of the start, this accelerates the start-up of & digiarrived;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting out after new photos are looking for new photos; this extended the basic file to new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & digiarrived; if something comes from the base folder, asks & digiarrived; you should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digiarrived; you can choose the main window to your taste. these settings can select below settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiarrived; you will find further information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiarrived; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correcting and improvement. the image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the updated advertisements / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; so you are under circumstances not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">Status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current data number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo, once you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should have finished a copy of your picture before you change it. you can save it with File Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored the picture, you can restore the original image or use the button Restore Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can return backward, or restore processing or reproduced by selecting from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use it, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and remove Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to re-establish.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you push the & LMB; read the button or restore button in the tool bar, get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also regent or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation links in the toolbar, picture top, picture down or the entries in the File File. if you have any changes on the current photo, you will be asked whether you want to save this.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can start in the photo and zoom in that you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or use the entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. normally, you will find the toolbar code. normally, you can also download the toolbar code. if you don't want this, you can call this in the dialog dialog by & digiarrived; click the main window. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, you can select the image file image and receive the Standard & KDE; printer dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. complete picture display pages can select from your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exports. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiarrived; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which is important information and actions for selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation system, even in the image processing. it will appear when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider leaves the sidebar and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can insert shading with unlimited size or insert. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC shading field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you annotted it, use either the button Apply or change to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluates a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sortifications. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the side bar or with the keyboard code Strg + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar will always be applied only on a picture. to evaluate more pictures at the same time, choose the menu and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field, the coding follows the pattern in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sample view shows a search box for filtering of the keywords, sample tree, and a select box with the previously shown in this & digiplug; -session related subject.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adapted dynamically to the set search. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom line is another relief in the input of keywords at a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed through marking of the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all key words are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the sample filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword sample filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Datum-, sample and search views. if in addition, one or more sample filters from the right side will be used, only the cutting quantity of these two are displayed. all characters are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and lay down. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can easily put it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialogue that you ask whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day. the keyword filters are reduced to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that, a keyword out of the right keyword is drawn on the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched to settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or his, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an expanded search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this job. I mostly adapted to & digiarrived; s more specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you set up a farmed-administered workflow, you can reach a predictable variation of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colored workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor or scanners, and the colors that you print or print them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color administration, everybody wants to push the buttons that he wants to press the results that he wants to make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial will allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workworkflow met all six criteria, then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or the web where sRGB of the de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and what makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and do not need to make thoughts about color spoiled signs?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color brownish, please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellent page and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I have decided to work in the sRGB space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working on the RGB space space or not, you need to monitor your monitor via sRGB mode, so you need to use your monitor on sRGB cables, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, you need to use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool represents five automatic corrections available, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, equal, automatic and contrast from the menu corrected Automatic correction automatically try to make the best. they will have to experiment with these effects, to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scalability the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as light as possible without its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method: this method Adjusts the luminance of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity can be as flat as possible. this means that the same very good results with the improvement of the contrasts, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful surgery which causes either miracle in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone of the lowest and highest values in the widest range and a re-jib of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digiarrived; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white off one photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-right-correction is slightly limited to a color space with 8-bit color. if you can carry out the white image below. if you can perform the white immediately in the rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will improve your correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white salt-salt, protected by Pawel T. Jochym. she will launch it via the menu entry colours White at the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, the original image is adapted as well as the preview of the tool. once you want to see the original whichbox below, then it is enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of Pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram shows that dynamic changes will change. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated pictures, most pixel is very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve or download the shading details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls around, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture to calculate the color temperature of the white comparison. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white off with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indistator increases the colors, if more than a color channel of pixels is coated. you will see the combined result in the white comparison. this is displayed in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store exactly this. any adjustment of the white comparison you have set to store in a text file and recharge later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white comparison. note that neutral settings will be shown another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code yeast per color channel of the working image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this code requires even more turntables, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profils. color mapping can be carried out through the subwindow for the Helligth. a detailed manual for the use of paint profiles, you can draw the chapter of paint management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colours. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for sound quality, you can find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour defects presents you four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the sensitive photopier of the extra light. this was the effect that the brighter areas protected by the second lighting were inverted. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows which chemically is possible. another increase is finally generated, a negative picture that is not to create on photopier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and process the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contradiction, which makes the colours brilliant and passionate. try it easy, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvet offers highly saturated colors, but also some photographer, especially those hardly made landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilters simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeats the strength of the neonlight. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and the luminosity of photos in the menu. as soon as you are happy with the result, use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo at bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead. if you prefer the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukemia / contrast / Gamma is the tool scale correction to improve exposure of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need to explain the application for the range of slips. more specifically, the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slicks can be placed in the inside and the left side represents the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to learn is the regulator to move and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, the following options are available on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scalability: with this select box can be set, whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is displayed. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic scale is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinets can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. moreover, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two controllers in order to change the output values. for example, compression values can be used, for example, to create an easy picture as background to create something different in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set in depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: these buttons can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. the Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, resources and solar oil. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the histogram for rotor, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The transmission indicator indicator controls all color channels, to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here, it is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect on a preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this select box allows the channel to be modified from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to these boxes there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring digital camera mode, linear mode produces a broad bar. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortage to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that this bright tones can be used with dark tones and can be darker-darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change a right line on the curve, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it off and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every turn you can have generated in the file system and later, the file format is the Gimp Curvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the checkpoint for all channels of the shadow, medium and solar oil. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The transmission indicator indicator controls all color channels, to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here, it is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect on a preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and Sonnentöne was used with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digiplug; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the color shades of photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the pictures. you can edit it from the menu color blender blender.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional box, you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first indication as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison of his own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you move this in picture a vertical line in the histogram to display the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to keep these channels. if you can also activate the corresponding colour components, as the channel blender will then make DAS tool to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white Portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that does not appear on the same spot in the color channel and looks different in any channel. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion to reduce the farbrauschen first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer-setting allows you to save and then charge. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The transmission indicator indicator controls all color channels, to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here, it is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect on a preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel is adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating due to your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, as color pictures can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film setting with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all the scenes and fits particularly well to portraits against heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filmed: simulated a black / white film setting with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfiltered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotter: simulates a black / white film setting with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic Ascension and can simulate moon liars to the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film setting with an yellow lens filter. this is the natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones whilst adding a bit cold into the shades. this is very similar to the process of an prints and re-development in a sepicatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture can apply decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry can be used to use texture.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the form of depth, or three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Texture effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the parameters relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a picture is no easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you enter the desired frame type for your image. immersed the picture with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), encapsulates it with a nice three-dimensional frame, ideal for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: gives the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This frame is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple, formatted text in a picture in any spot. this is also possible at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use text of text, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need. the bigger the picture, the larger the character set must be. finally, simply dial a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button "OK." after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template. apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Template apply in the image editing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. you don't need to add the PNG file format and should add maximum compressing (9) to the file size of the template; please send an e-mail in English to the & digiarrived; Mailing list digiarrived-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template file with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder in which you notice the template. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils appears, a building view that reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview three buttons are located with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move on the template under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your image. then the picture will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiarrived; offers three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but created especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpfe-mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharpened. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusus may possibly be the best of three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitizing pictures require a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more retroactive sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images has often been used to use internal sharpening. images in the raw format, however, must always be broken in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a sharpness filter already during reading the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can receive usable results by sharpening a photo with sharpness advertiring. you can correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, because the results are not very natural: sharpening the sharpness of edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the usable technology is sharpened. in general, you can add further information and comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. to draw the image a bit soft, it is much easier to use. use the tool to fix it with the menu entry. use the pattern on the right side of the dialog box show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the picture. the window window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the sharpening mask to strong, noise and impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius provides a how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high resolution images allow larger radios. they should therefore sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount indicates the percentage between the original and the ignorant image that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is worth a break out of the maximum RGB-value and the difference amount. one can thus define a minimal difference which is used for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpened, therefore avoided beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the insharp masquerading filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). insharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refuses refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture to & quot; refocussed quot; in which it makes a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is used to achieve better results than unsharp masking. you can run it from the menu by calling colors revocally in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding down a lot better than the Gauss's folding down. the Gauß's Fume has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result of the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel pixel, which is even very strongly influenced by distant Pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results. you can bet a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. usable values are 0.5 and the values close by 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter may be very bad as 0,1. however, values are very bad. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 becomes the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will still be screwed on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you should use this value to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Match size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase in the match size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß '. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any refusing parameters that you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all concision, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible immediately, but then left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress, eg; JPEG, you should apply the module based on uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, insharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused that insharp masking would use a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to be seen insharp masking. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the impossible filter. practical, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpest mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small-focused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regularity of the range is darkened, in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte enables a customized color for the pupils. if you like blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available settings are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings for a adjust, you can use the riders on smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details pane p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass in the picture. a value of 0.9 should get details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details of the details should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film gradation or CCD noise will produce a high value of wave similar patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0] 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative humidity. therefore set the value to the degree of smokers in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is affecting bigger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is required, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeats: returns how often the algorithm are running. usually 1 or 2 normally is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepping up there [5, 90]: Anisotropic integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be chosen too small. make sure to create a small angle of a long term. so you should choose this value so much and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral part of [0,1, 10]: integral pacemaker in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you can get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubles the duration. we recommend it to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store exactly this. correct any adjustment of image errors can be loaded in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast in work. however, it can take a very long and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can abrupt the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors will be corrected using small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that is caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiarrived; smoke induction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts which come from dust or hair to the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy smoker that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the lower settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel needs and can be pampered by the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter to the front look around fluorescent changes. if the value is high, the adaptive filter image details can't get more and rouching or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole space can be removed or smoker tips may occur. put it at a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak or JPEG Artefacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend using either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process of the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance, to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process of the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas that are typically stronger, however, also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges can occur when it is high, can remove noise and phasenjitter to the edges. he can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store up and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters of space-casting, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how roughage can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the smoke induction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. luckily, you can draw a bit easier than a picture with the menu entry. use this tool to fix the soft tip with the menu entry. use the pattern on the right side of the dialog box showing the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiarrived; photo restoring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts, film grainy, scratches, compression facts and local errors that takes place in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images, thereby preserving the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colouring and texturing. the text translation is developed with another tool, the image error correction was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannylon and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas it is even very far away. as a loss of compressive compressionism, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should fix these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store exactly this. any adjustment from photo-restoration can be loaded in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast in work. however, it can take a very long and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knocking button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with equalization space. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grainy on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoring. this time, textures can be viewed on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner which is produced by scanning lighting and photopier. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows it to remove Hotpixel's hotpixel. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw material photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; at a photo with a dark picture subtracting method. there is no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button dark. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can explore the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture of the dark picture. note that the assistant will notice the last night and will automatically reload this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture range and the preview can help you correct the result. the show window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted up in all processes areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the Filters. then select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel-poles. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined on average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defaults pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 from Pixelblock to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a batch of linear curves (1-dim) or a batch of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixel-block at a distance of 2 or less to Pixelblock are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolate the pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixel with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a batch of cubic curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolate the defective pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure of exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underlined corners, to correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can't even light the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shades) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by taking the light into the sensor. Teleobjectives also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Blencer filter, which is impossible to keep the necessary shifting time under circumstances, even with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as usual impossible effects are created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is used without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction is used to simulate the transformation of a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three developers, you can control the Vignetting correction filters, and with three further exposure of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of beam intensity at the point of the biggest density of the filters. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly compensate an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly compensate the density of a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a little degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetting correction is reduced the lightness of the pixels. you must only adjust the exposure of the target set with these options, as you only need to increase your settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive reintegration of exposure of exposure, so leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a leukemia and contrasting correction was also done with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lentil distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colorings cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or constricted form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrects the remote corners opposite to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are hovered distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value seems stronger than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' has the reverse mark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scalates the image size and thereby leads a correction of the first grades. negative values increase while positive the image shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightest: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview of distortion correct. the values you use for your image will be stored and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all concision or size changes. in the best way you perform this correcting as all the first. if you have to re-cut a picture and then add a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, such as the sea rand or a building wall, in your image, and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transformer or remove the regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct the angles below 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview allows you to adjust two parameters to film grainy and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the customized texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-controls changed the amount of film grafts and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels for reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of Infrared filmeektes applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film gradation is a simple to use tool to reproduce film gradation at your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to enhance the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturer of great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photography, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control of intensity and granularity of granulator. the default value is, even though higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film effects on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil factory. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. nature and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brushes are better suited for big images. smoothing controls the glamour, or from the other side look, the sniper.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processed is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640-pixel size is 1 and glass of 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intolerance gradient to create a carbonic acid, so it's not ideal for this effect. it's helpful when you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch for you. this would be good pictures to begin with this.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator cover the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal filter filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; Filter engraving marks your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, dark scenery.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: divides the picture in cells and can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the knocking button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by irradiation effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: get the image along the formal lines going out by a central point. this is simulated the sharpness a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial nonsense: wiping the image through the pixel by a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wiping the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of movement: wiping the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpening of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softwood: wiping the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shining soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solidation: wiping the image through accidental displacement of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paint pools in the image and wiped out this without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knocking button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. this gives the natural your pictures a nutshell. it uses a pieter Voloshyn-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">The trophy size allows to change the size of the drops. since the size of the image is not growing, it is often necessary to decrease the size of the drops. number changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep with the & digiplug; image processing a area free of regentropes. use the range of tool to select the area, e.g. a face that will be free to stay free. if you then start the filter regentropes, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelves. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the transformers, rotating or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you look up a picture and guess the details? how can you find the missing information back or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it on the desired size with the size of size. select your size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size changes a linear Interpolation method to increase the pixel's pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow job.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge picture. & digiarrived; uses a further developed approach. based on the basis algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Holding aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the size ratio of the original image is preserved in the input of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is affecting bigger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is required, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and store are used exactly. any input for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knocking button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by adding a small colour picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only carried out surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together with the mouse, simply by pressing the mouse button, pressing the mouse button and move up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get rid of the mouse button, the area of photos will be cut off. this allows you to change a good overview as your photo by cutting edge. you can create the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle simply create it by simply with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cut-out button, use the button button button in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file File Save or File Save in the File File to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In advance, you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse. aspect ratio that you defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool applies to aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically-centered.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to cut the area into the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool for side effects stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the concision tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The Comprehensive Assistance Service Provides Help You to extract your pictures better. these assistance are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third ellipse, harmonic triangles are a way to share a rectangle in harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division spread over various natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used to create your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have already used the golden division in all times when you build your pictures, buildings and even photos, to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from the Fibonacci episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two. the resulting part is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden-center provides liquefied aid lines if you are using a picture. these assistance are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third ellipse, the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye can be in the heart of its composition. it can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also slide from the top-mentioned golden spiral. their jackets are the middle of the pages of the golden rectangles. please note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equisosly triangles. diagonal object can be made more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame, create a effect of the professional photographer dynamic Symmetry. try your focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and verticals are used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button colour you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this type can adapt the colour of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you are not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and tool free rotation. select "Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the shooting angle. the values on this slipcase can be set in degrees. with the button settings you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation will display a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer to positioning the two lines. after having an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transformers from using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic accessory. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are developed through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are developed through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments will generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After completing the perspective, you get injoyous triangular holes at the corners. one way to transfer this is the image to cut off from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The hose tool is used to move a portion of the picture to the right and the other part into the opposite direction. this is no shooting, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is changed into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can adjust horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having carried out the failure, the image will be a bit vertically. for a single failure, this effect is usually neglected, but two jackings are doubly negligible, and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shifting the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the image to cut off from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiarrived; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats vary from your system and, in some cases, from the type like these libraries. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiarrived.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import / function of metadata module you can copy data from a picture to another. select the import function in the main program and then call the dialog box dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image will be copied to which you have pressed on the button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, using a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a basic screen size. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically for the correct video format. in addition, you can select a background colour for the diaschau. in addition, you can use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you must first choose the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that you can launch the module via Extras maschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are displayed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change sorting images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you select the file from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD file. if you are planning the file on a TV set, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture below. the speed of the image output is set down below. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast is very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set up next. in doubt, you should make it black. the name and the path of the generated file can set you under name of the MPEG file format. keep the extension of the extension.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. depending on the speed of your computer, you can go quickly or in all silence a coffee and enjoy the diaschau if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codiers or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistent allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard photographs. the combined images can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to print you or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and restart the module. the Raw-Image Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview can look at the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be utilised for the white frame. essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name remains unchanged and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses an lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have frequently asked to process your pictures or later you should not use the JPEG format as it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted to your settings, you can start converting button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. use this mode, therefore, for example, through testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to write existing file automatically. this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available, but the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it is using the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting point and the timestamp of the user.</seg>

<seg id="917">& kickalbum; presented to you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kickalbum; integrated and the other as module is available (see). in the following part of the user book, you can create HTML... read the HTML's menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of sublicks and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kickalbum pop album; export file is to be seen on the reviews side. nourishing information about export files are found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. by this way, you can avoid that information are displayed without description. for example, all images are displayed by a party. at the moment all pictures are exported. at the moment all pictures are exported. you cannot use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the application options are clearly, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below, you can set different resolutions on the pictures. this way, those need to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The amount of your page can change the resolution at any time. so, it can cause your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, as well. if he wants to get a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this application area, you place the different folders and the URL, where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, for all your HTML files, choose a base folder and for each of the following set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder, where all your pictures are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if this really are all visible to the viewer. if you select a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you should click here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case, if the HTML files are not yet in final destination, you need to manually copy them manually. thus, the import-function, see, correctly, you need to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described configuration options are based on basic folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder created, whose name is specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking at a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kickalbum, you may want to add a HTML page to viewing the images. if you have already got a lot of time to view the pictures, recording location, etc., then you'll have to do with & kickalbum; this work doesn't even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kickers; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kin file. these can import others into your database. the image features are associated with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin -files, internal and external. they differ whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of all pictures into the file is that you have all pictures together and this file can be so independent. the obvious downside is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can exporting a .kim file directly from the File File... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file is looking for the pictures on two times. first, the images are not found, so the images of the URL, which you have indicated in creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export of images are described, exporting the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When Manually copy to the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim file copy & kickalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worthwhile to compressed the files. if you want to do so, simply dial the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is limiting the maximum image size. if you don't want to send your friends pictures, as the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by, for example, that every picture should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select, becomes & kickalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to stimulate consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures would like to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are called the category persons of the import file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported to the categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database. one example is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and look at: if you see pictures, you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will run the various steps of (1) visualization of information about your pictures, about (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was expanded and today your videos takes care of. at many places in this manual will talk about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kickalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale securing tools, copy on a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kickalbum; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used for future Starts automatically again. if you want to read another database with pictures, you can start with the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings, set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kickalbum; in the following section of the user book, you will be explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the preview of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how to create different properties, such as persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">To see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialogue options, you can set complete member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group do instead of all groups of a glimpeds as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the installation possibilities, which are available to you for the fixed list of the members. you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window pens there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kickalbum; shares his modulation system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. nourishing information on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the modules. these modules can not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kickalbum; however, most modules have a help side which you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together among other applications, it may be that the modules are tested with & kickalbum; just very little tested, you should first call on the command line with the command &gt; photo album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or about the menu Help. don't say, I don't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kickalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & co-album and other applications, which is also KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums. even if & kickalbum; this type of order does not support, simulates some modules the order for albums, so that you can use the features with & kickalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kicky album; the current album which is simply the current view, so all pictures you show the picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & album-album, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes & kickalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kickalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used in the category dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you have chosen the category people, & kickalbum will be done, so if you have chosen people to view the module and continue the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kickers are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog box and select the module which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen, once you start & kickalbum; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window below. under the tool bar you can see the window, with which you can't have any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, but now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kickalbum; is the opportunity to see each image with notes on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images to set certain notes simultaneously. if, for example, on all images of Jesper, and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this remarks, if you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you can define three lists with a text box by clicking people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kickalbum; as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the images inside the list: if you are depicted a family celebration, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be depicted, so that the used names are postponed up to the above, to find people faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to select a alphabetical list, click the icon for sorting under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes on each image individually, you may still need to edit all selected images and select these pictures with notes. just click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to check all these pictures and select the menu item more detail at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the section, it is possible to add an entry into a existing or new revision or subcategory. additionally, you can also make an entry on a category and make it possible to sort this entry into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you are alphabetically sorted your categories.</seg>

<seg id="982">If you select the post pictures in the browser, you'll get an overview of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have filters. for example, you can see the size of the thumbnails, by simply downward pulling the mouse with the middle brigaze, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you handle a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture viewer. if you still have no window opened with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding images that you want to delete and press either the removal button or select in the Edit menu. now the window will appear you can see in the picture.</seg>

<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the property tree, select the position to insert the object and select either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Is there multiple possible positions, the following attachment menu will be embedded, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this changes. if you have invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can click on application or discard the changes with disrupting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview of your own society view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on a preview of the scene with the chosen texture and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen texture. if you want only one part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire view. this cross is marked the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a wire model. you can specify this value relatively to the point level of the above-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller, or equal to the stage-chosen visible stage of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and view of the object properties are displayed, and the four graphical views are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like a default window system or if you need any other arrangement, you can adjust it as well. you can also store multiple windows, and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To make a window over or below a present view, you pull the reference to the upper or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, take the reference to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored at the right or left side of this view, and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange multiple views to another view, you prefer the signing in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card tracker in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window frames are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the reference to your desktop or click on the small to the left arrow in the box.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the box bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are weak, you can roots them on any other spot.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can run it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to Rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click the symbol Rendering The symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the option's view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full-quality photos.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render, click on the toolbar or in the menu view, Render modes... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to detect the characteristics of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the straight picture. if you want to rendering a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination box quality you can select the features, the & Povray; for rendering. this is a very simple colour and light model to a model of complex diffuser-diffuser lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render features can be found in the User manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is traded with only a beam ever pixels, various mistakes can occur. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or martial effects in curves and lines, besides, details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally see images with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and links & Povray; more than a beam each pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling is adapted quickly; recursive, because each pixel is further divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated paint values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam ever. if you calculate the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels, then both pixel will be calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grid of 4x4 is charged extra points, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 - g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, the rays are changing & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last attitude for the quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are supposed to be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams had no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing of & Povray; if & Povray; if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; not yet supported the full command-catch of & Povray;. if, when importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the property tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code to the text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code and drag him into the property tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is POVRAY or x-POVRAY.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in an image view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your document tention and version. support versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example alfeline) in the pads to the & Povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the scene of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first used file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the inspection points. the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object from points to the button in the context menu of the wire model view. you can set the grid for shifts, scaling, scams and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values showed a more precise wire model and thus a better proximity to the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box sample of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a floor will be traded below the objects. the floor is shown in a box sample of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check edge support, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering scenes is used. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more detailed information about the parameters you can find in the Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change the existing shutters or create new window orders. in the section window orders, explains how you can create windowels and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination of the standard window frames: shows all the existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window rules in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-hand shutters shows all the existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window settings. new views can create and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with inlets you get the window below the existing window, with signature card and view the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you've just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow no more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this instruction, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings, before you complain about that you can only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules for renders can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything wrong, you can see the first start of & kpovmodeler; following pre-cleaning window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols, and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object-tree. mark the scene and select the menu entry. you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry with the name Camera. if it click on it, you'll see the content of the view object properties, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera can change in view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button Apply or the input, change the wire model and the object-tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they look at the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could set up a quader (insert endable body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the property tree, change the name and press the button Apply or the input. in the object-tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the plain, even though at the moment only as limited endable level. when you run the scene, the plane stretched out until the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object-tree exactly, you'll notice that you can click on the symbol + before the object. in this case, you can only find the options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the soil to exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. select displacement and provide the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the bottom to place its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object-tree. you can see the name in the image view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button. see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments are only a mat black material because you can still need settings for the pigment. do you always remember that you can review the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are in preview no color on Quader and ball, click on the button Apply and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now set correctly. if you select your picture now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors that you have expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can also do this entry twice (you can also use this entry twice, but the chess boards can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select an object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should just do this step, as you can already understand the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood. the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the value for the radius: 1 (do not forget the input of the button or button to press) so that the ball could float over the ground, as you have moved to the ground for a unit down below.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders are now a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears as a matt black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now draw a material now. as already in the ground, enter the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the Pigment, select and select the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click Apply or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes of gloss effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayness is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracting, the renders hypothetical radiance from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, reflecting the scenes) through each pixel by the objects and is broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog work. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be cleared, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file, which you have created with & kpovmodeler; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model, or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restarted the scene in the last stored version. all changes since the last store will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu, if you haven't stored any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last re-catchy command. this menu entry can only be selected if you are using editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window system and opens up a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the keyboards and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens up a dialogue to change the keyboard code. you can add default shortcomings for & kpovmodeler; edit or add new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialogue to set up the tool bar. you can add and remove toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to add rough surfaces, without changing any beves on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable portrait and browser. the application has a browser-browser, where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in your own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions to find mostly in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function could look & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command-line options of Qt and & KDE; additionally, Amarok still has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use dialog, so the user does not run a script.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Result Error error = 'Korundum (KDE Bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is Required for this script.' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the file scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts using Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should lie to each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow the executions of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok branches; send alerts to all the scripts. for this reason, scripts will monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script may ignore the events even if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script, display the configuration dialog. if a script will take care of each script itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder on the folder where all data is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script might now query & zb; for example, the script might ask additional information about the new piece (for example the metadata, or the denominations).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newdisk signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuclicked: subdirectory itemTitle] gives the path to selected files the playlist. submenu and itemTitle are also given, so that the script can add the clicked entry. to remove one entry, you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomary Item (subclass itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok branches off, or if the user stops a script, send & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do for example, for example, the saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive name such as e.g; B. my skript.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced Texosscript. for this reason you should rename your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main kript must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and link the link to the Wiki scripts side of & amarok branches; for your entry to KDE apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & KDE; & quot; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1480">This opens a dialogue window to change the key orders for & k3b; after one of the available commands are selected in the upper part, one can adjust the key assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; alignment assistants. thus, the correct permissions may be set to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore system administrator rights are needed, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; you should work on Anhieb. this dialogue is meant to personalise and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b is, as many other & KDE; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a Shelltranscript.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line dcop, or the somewhat comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical, therefore it's more your taste and the type of task is crucial, which the biting programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line-line program dcop. in order to make use & DCOP; you must make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and further features to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createBike CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () Void copyreateMovixDVDProject () Void copyerdvd () Void-Dvd () Void burnCdimage () Void burnCdimage (KURL url) Void burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you can create a project via command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via using the # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject Through using this reference it is possible to change the project over K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b features the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only apply to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) Void createFolder (Qstring name, QString) Void remodell (KURL) Void removeItem (QString path) Void ReameItem (QString path) Void ReameItem (QString path, Qstring newname) Void setvoleID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a script project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createFolder test dcop $PROJECT creamy / foo dcop $PROJECT creamy url / home / trusty / summerefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder of the computer installed.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (to read & CD) data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many codiers, which are supported by these WAV files (compressed-free compression). other coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD, is compiled by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, but it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. if the FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiers gives a small introduction of coefficients, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CDs; such as already, uses & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection. if it's not possible to handle any copy protection. in any case, & kaudioCreator; even not the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup only has to be made only once (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration), the daily handling of a & CD has to be explained (hopefully) for understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which will often be stumbled at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">It can convert in many formats - depending on which Kodierer programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coaster and compression rates and helps you choose the right Kodierers' choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for these distribution. the disadvantages are small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information thanks to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important, as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will be delivered free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rate), but compared to OGG lightly lower quality at lower bitrate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame' help 'for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate around 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genetic for music by young people, portable devices and car stereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want to have the absolutely highest quality without any view on the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically collected from the freeDB file via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the code program to create folder and file names, as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codiers, there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or help to the codiers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title for the keyword (English: day) if MP3s will be coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button-name in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database to read the information up / enter the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself to the calculator. it is too note that all other information can be downloaded instead of text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (m.) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you out of the & CD which is publicly available on the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be attached to the music company. all the information can be obtained by a & CD; business, physical or virtual, can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; it's active to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address can not be used when invoke the data from server (this can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; for use of freeDB, the geographically on the next level of mirror is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online consultation of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the whole database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which file program is used to store pieces from the & CD in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the expended WAV files, the code can be selected and thus the required file format can be selected. at the first opening are defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tabular tab for the setup of the codiers. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the code is required. this is also necessary for the predefined coders. more information about coders are in the chapter Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, further information can be received via its switch via the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (cover; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the typewriter and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to access both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could be a hint of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check it out for the shell & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips may be how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg; by copying your queror something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; something which is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD, which must be repeated for any disapproving & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program that freezes freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will probably not change it with any evaluation of a & CD, if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation will be handed over to the reader program to read the & CD file data.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use the existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of the general settings. here there is no much to do. there can be an additional conversion defined here. in our example everything will be ventilated / entered as shown on screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in full information please select, so that you will be informed when you are missing details of the sample code (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD files automatically downloadable via the Internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading of & CD with the Internet to access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD record; entry is found immediately if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory entry / file name or tag entries, you can easily changed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, if you want to enter all manually, you will deactivate the select fields and freeDB file. however, you can use the database before. however, this is worth about 620 MB. however, these two select fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data enquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server about the Internet. how do the system which data can get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything in the screen picture above.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page of freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. this way, however, the burden between the host is distributed. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls carry the protocol 8880 standardly, there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first check box should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp does exist on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">A number of things at the same time: excuse me, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know, so simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check it out around the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you are using this thread, then the path / folder will be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. if only one place is available on another drive, you will not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is on screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances, something must be puffed up to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, the resulting bitrate is sufficient on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. this reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if required. kidney 3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & KDE. in case of later changes the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the intervention (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encodes WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for any evaluation of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the type as the music on the hard drive, was described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD which will be described in this section, must be repeated for any disapproving & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD which is not included in freeDB, see the screen photos a bit different from the data available for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD data manually, instead of taking them from the Internet. comments are shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD is set; in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen photo. this only if the & CD has been identified as audio CD; identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then you are looking for questions and answers to help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully from the freeDB file, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; -Settings in the dialog for Settings), you can get this manually through the choice of the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have any local database, but the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Aktuell title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Refeller title', unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidiers each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freeDB file, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up at the tab card settings; take a look in the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can download the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the help of the code to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, obviously, with the style of the exclusive CD; this example is not important because we do not transmit the & CD data. for more information about the categories of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields are already filled with the specified data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line of the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked out are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or select the button All pieces choose at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection read the reading process, so this window appears to be confirmation. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is now read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will you see if you are trying to work with a coaster you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. therefore, check and coding parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the result of parallel operation. the calculator with a amd64 appears to be no problem with simultaneously read and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the codiers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator; you need & KDE; 3.2.2.4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midian and Karaokespieler of & KDE. besides others he has not have a real-time graphics and karaoke-real-time highlighting of texts, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system to work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; support also & Linux; Ultrasound projection driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or textures). KMid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish & KDE, while playing a song end, KMid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file-dialog, with which help you select the required song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also download a file from one & konqueror; windows are allowed in the & kmid; Windows will also work with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and try the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry to play from the menu piece or get the space button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will start automatically as soon as you pull it on the & kmid; window. (at several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump on any position by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the control.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or played too slow, you can click on the left and right of the speed display and get the speed of speed. to get the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space button has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the empty button, or the pick up of menu entry in the menu piece, thus interrupts the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and another both. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you have to manually change anything. if you choose to change the karaoke text, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select the menu settings the entries and check boxes. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarize. these will be played in this section as you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection managers first. click here in the menu collection under the point.... click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the vins in the collecting manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. concerns you if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the button. it appears again the file-dialog, with which help you select the required song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If Automatically add to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatisch is not activated for the collection, the opening of a piece is activated and gelert. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the required song and then click on Removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the submenu image sequence of the menu, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in a collector manager, or use the select list over the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the knock next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the post previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter if they are not stored at leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet's type Change patch when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need MIDI-map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so, you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary conversions for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. premise for this is, however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices which are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality mark is ignored. it is believed that GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you can't change the order, and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-KeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a fireman. for this purpose, you can use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (plumage), patch is 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum-patch of the patch is meant to be a different percussion instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum (such as some keyboards own).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you must only use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to complete tones on the Persian-channel. check yourself as an example the supplied keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword must be used in the file name for this channel! if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the permeate patch on the Persian-channel patch.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Bender Ratio is multiplied, in which ratio Pitch-bends-events will be multiplied by the value of n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then reforwarded to the formula n * (r / 4096), so that the value 4096 is used to do so in the map file (no decimal score).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard, which is to play a pitch of pitch. unfortunately, try to play some keyboards for two sounds up to a octave. unfortunately, you must try a bit with & kmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, item MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you can see what sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">View the channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you like to find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force to force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; you have been compiled because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In the way, enable automatic adjustment to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double the arrow keys left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; -Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desk (if I want to play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), or I want to play a file, merely go into the & konqueror window, and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to hear a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic adjustment to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you only want to play the first file. so, adjust the automatic adjustment to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then complete, also B.mid and C.mid play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me to program further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonius Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Male; Laga. at the moment I'm not much leisure for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as Hobbies, I am planning to collect MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to download where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, send me an e-mail: mask pink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really want to send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file. before you send an MIDI file, but you should contact me as I maybe already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; complete in my spare time and didn't get money from it. I therefore want to find out that I can only reprogramell because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">One sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because sound quality depends essential from your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card unless you can hear no music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. in addition, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear if information are shown therein.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections below the menu Bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other, you should use the category of continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchies. if you want to balance an entry, its group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist may also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, you can choose to choose one name, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category click, and as next editing mode. by clicking on a subgroup only the XML content is displayed this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected with playlist and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be turned on by using the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at the start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer, the file is ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start does not need to be short, it will automatically end by opening another source. however, this would be disrupting at the end of the animation, so the user can stop the application for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the advertisements of a favorite pictures: & lt; smilgt; & lt; IMG dur = "unacceptable; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; /; in the source pack of & kmplayer; are supported in the folder / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration MPlayer in configuration dialog by & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no horsemen for this rendition dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual processing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played by the swfdec-mozilla:</seg>

<seg id="1724">In order to play & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages must play & kmplayer; module as service providers for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the configuration dialog file of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; can be used in a consoles application and following error messages in the browser's browser. if there are no errors, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to make a pre-given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayhc. for example, phonon will play all ogg files:</seg>

<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorders) settings in kmplayer, the dialog can be detected in the settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected port (e.g., it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably will contain a DVB-in.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (presumably this type of playing video devices will also work. this is why the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functioning in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation this dvdnavsource, source, pipeswax, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. when enabled, they begin playing with the playlist of playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile; there is a simple problem for exploring the output file. however, it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you through the highlighting time and more.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic understanding of environments (e.g.\\ 'command}) of & kile; automatically creates an empty line (to input the text) and the added line for the closing of the text (e.g.\\\ {command}). this function can be deactivated in the menu settings (e.g.\\\ {command}).</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; encourages the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements are changed through a mouse click on the respective and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In the creation of its own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file [germany folder)] has been created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font type & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and print of DVI; -files for various systems and systems.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the RÃ ¼ m search, the elements of the DVI; file is clicked on an item in the & latex; source code is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in & latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding place in the & latex; source code is covered.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is simplified at work with multiple files. with a master document, the work with other integrated .tex files will be simplified. when using a project, project project can be set up project management system project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically shown (unless there are no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File transfer: in this mode, the DVI; file is on to open-up, and it takes no call of & eyepiece; after quick-construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In view of the editing tool bar, the three large selection of selection should be developed for the fast insert of common elements into the document. the first selection field is available for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... the veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The select field is for further items such as keywords, R, notes, notes, notes, or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Regarding: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection of selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. for editing & BibTex; files are required editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author can also be written in & kile; you can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The final selection field with the name GrÃ Ã ¼ e will be used for the definition of the font size. it can be specified for the main text, the fusions, etc., the following fonts are set for:</seg>
<seg id="1775">At the call of & kile; two selection menus are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and the presentation of the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 1 class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. will not be set up at the beginning, this can happen in the text as well.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code is entered, the & latex; source code is compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of menus or button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & kile; add automatically the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compile of the document should be searched after the errors. when using quick-construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (English environment) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font size is made. the command\\ 'to {environment},\\ Huge and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The building will only be overseen within the environment (between\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). there is no shading (number) for outdoor purposes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many types of view of the read and user-friendliness of the document. it can be used for example specific fonts, fat pressure, siveness, underlines, etc. these commands are either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {empih}: this command is available for the courses and is long as long as it is closed, until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be depicted with\\ empih {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quotation begins with\\ 'quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background of the source code with the & latex; pronunciation language is represented, now follows a step-for-step instructions for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistants have been entered a bit text, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. this should be a quote, a few places in fat and spa print and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl e can be returned to the editor (at the internal viewer). an external viewer must be closed on an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. easy to try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a combined file format (engl. D e V ice I noll). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi issue such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF format or computer screen umbrellas.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, you can then print the document via file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion can begin to test other formats using the BFE in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The foreman search encourages direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. only Modern under settings have to set up remover... tools are to be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To be placed in a row of the source code, the mouse indicator must be positioned in a line of the source code and will be clicked on preliminary test. the jump to the corresponding place in DVI; viewer is soaked.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the Middle Maustaste in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & kile; open and to be specified; in & eyepiece; displayed as a text editor (settings the eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quickness of the & DVI; viewer is not possible, there may be an error. should an error occurred in the protocol file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logistive file is the source source in the source code. in the editor then the text file is always displayed on the line, in which the error appears. to view the correct row, the error must be clicked on the error in the log file and & kile; jumps to the error code.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to choose from using the document for the document. the default value are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can be used either from the ground or the assistant to the quick preparation of a new document. further information on this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Basic users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates: templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; -/ latex; -file can be created or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and select file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in atile settings... settings are processed.</seg>
<seg id="1803">For creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as such as:\\ 1 Class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that it is related to the commands in editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then the template's own template can be selected instead of a standard size.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created out of any & latex; files are created. a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and can be found under the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for your tools directly from & kile; can be made out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and to learn its delicacies, the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; you can tell you directly with reading of the chapter & Kate's Editor.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command referential which can be called on the menu help LaTeX reference. it contains almost all commands, which can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click press button to balance the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip will only be selected\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the text of the text, the selected text will be copied automatically into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can choose parts of the source code in the Editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the solution to browse the most varied types of source codes. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants have to spread. this is a unique kind of bookmarks within the text. the menu entry is emphasized or the corresponding key stamp. this is also emphasized this jump brand, so it will be automatically encircled with the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & Kate; already excellent moods, offers important functions for writing a & latex; source code; important functions for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Wears a complete paragraph (group of lines listed on both sides). this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines of the source code, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. it is the only prevailing thing in & kile; it is that the distance is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word is divided under the current cursor position. this selection has also an extended meaning, as this command also spread & latex; commands with a wide range (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, a part of the document can be removed from this first and remove through the key of the key. & Kate; offers the key element Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers the following commands to include a faster tool. under editing, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a shipments of & kile is included in the description.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been clear that environments is a central role in & latex; play. therefore, & kile; for more commands under editing environment for a great simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command\\ 's {environment} is found to be taken at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the entry of many polluted environment commands, the access may be lost quickly. this command is close to the most recent environment, so that the waste environment structure will not be distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. under the Edit TeX group are a few important commands that are to do from the processing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is placed at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; group # is at the other end of the group calls (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the entry of many veiled groups-brackets can be lost quickly, the open group can be lost quickly. this command is close to the most recent group, so that the embellished structure of the & tex; groups are not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; the character will be used in & kile; the character will be used in & kile; the character will be used for the beginning of the beginning. also for the end of the beginnings, the character will be "used." & kile; this is the case and will be for two shut-up trials for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic single-start plate can be set up under settings Kile... LaTeX - and will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in case of specific settings (e.g. nically or French), so that German or French can be used. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In case of shift shift; inputs, & kile; a smart line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), you can only take a line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Pile & kile in a tables; the current line with the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users like to arrange the columns in tables and equile all Et-characters (amp;) among themselves. & kile; seeks to add this. even if this tabulator is not the addition to the next tabulator, add & kile; some intermediate space for the columns of the current Tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code completion, this was still expanded in & kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;), three are working on request and the other two are available for all different modes under settings Kile... complete set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When we start a new environment using the\\ 'command {environment} & kile; automatically added to the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the track button is removed, the last letter of input will be removed, and thus, it will be the most important input list. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by further letters.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be set up at choice of a command. alternatively, it is a simple jump to these positions using editing, jumping stamp, and can be applied to this positions.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Underneath kile; set up... kile; complete settings to these lists. it can be made possible with different types of knowledge for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as maps of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not surprising as a few letters with\\ 's. on the other hand, there will be a large list with environment commands to be entered. on the other hand, the environments will be used so often that & kile; a special mode can be used for deepening environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">Automatically replenish the surroundings of the surrounding area or the key element of Alt + switch button, and it appears\\ '. after that, the environment can be continued on a simple way and will be terminated by using the input of the input.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will be closed automatically. once & kile; recognizes that it is a listless environment, even a first\\ item command is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings cile; set up... kile; complete settings to these lists. this mode uses the aspect of the required mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; underscore user-defined lists of removable queries, which can be replaced immediately by the following parameters. the lists can be set up under settings. as an example, the file example.cwl, for example, is included the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word force mode has been initiated or the key element Ctrl + Alt empty space is replaced, the code L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large watering are not helpful. however, it has been noted that many of them will be written in a document more than once. so, & kile; the completion of all this is already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Menile settings... Kile comparability. here, the swelling can also be specified for viewing the placement of understanding.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but we offer an excellent basis for outdoor purposes and neworders of pages. if the PDF output is applied, the pages will be arranged with a few & PostScript; -Tools rearranged and then be converted with ps2pdf in a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to receive the result of work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the volume creation, creating converting and creating a view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compile of the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and can be viewed via Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command, a viewer is normally called to compile a viewer. if there should be an integrated viewer, a new window will be opened every time.</seg>

<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the development environment of scripts in & kile; a systematic object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of vegetative packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to undertake the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texas; are supplied with many documents. there are a documentation for the packages and another & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">It is not just a description of all programs (but some important packages are described) but rather, it is ideal for search for the & latex; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. as it is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the quantity of documents with those & tetex; / texas; the finding the right document is not always easy. as a variety of help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk which contains a database with all of & kile; supplied documents and includes a graphic surface area.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of user and serves as a unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leader as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look for yourself from the list of teammates, who he is. this happens by sending the team member from the list and the button Setze as presses. the currently selected member (their identification) will appear fat after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. through the standard, default encores can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other way as with opening open files (where the coding of the file can be overlooked), but this setting is used by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. but this setting is used by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regularly backup copy, so in case of a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document of this backup file. this is not the same as the file format. also for non-stored documents a backup regularly, according to the set time, created.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the field of mouse click on the structure-tree the following action is possible to change the structure of the structure with the mouse cliffs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural-tree settings the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically in the tree, which is set to be opened automatically. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are found, where there is no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for locating abbreviations (a kind of templates), which can be unfolding for more extensive text. abbreviations are valid in groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s, this means a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plug-ins can be managed by plugins. plugins are part-applications of third page, which can be reused by each KPart-enabled application, the best-known & Condor;. when inserting a plug-ins, the following plug-ins must be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to Plugin, if it's not on a stand there like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Entry: this information is delivered to the plug-in when starting, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-read" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to be denied. only-read-KParts usually refuse the store if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then testing & quantaplus; if the specified information is correct. then choose the store, even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; as of version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which enables different implementations on plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debit plug-ins in the project settings. with the options below the Debugger Plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the content of supervised variables. normally, it appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appear in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as seen in HTML) of the Debugger. usually appear in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the Debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to Debugger is necessary, if necessary, or it shares the plugin to listen to Debugans. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which needs a debug that must not be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The equivalent to debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to Debugger or terminates the lugs to meet requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to run a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Does the debugger begin to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the monitored variables as well as the current line is going on. if this happens when the script is continued, the script will continue, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Does the debugger start to begin with the execution of the script, without sending information, and the current line number. if this happens while a script is done, the execution continues. it happens before a debit claim will begin as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger leads the next statement in the script, without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger leads the next statement in the script, whereby it is possible in functions and includes incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger to go over and go to the next way, as if the current does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the audited value appears in the variance view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresome; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a quick insert of tags in a document without any risk of writing.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is in simple ways.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only be found in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains no one element type via itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, one interface and a methodology name. the arguments that are handed over to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only happen for a attribute description. it is a only element-type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute box of a tags within a dialogue. this day may only happen for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog up at the & quantaplus window is to start and check TagXMLA window. another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check out only at the shop of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the default settings and insert this text inserted in the document's current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or enter (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the Schnellstart -Dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be mentioned as the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myscripts. sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths are allowed is to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / quanta / scripts in their path: $PDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document the file name is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the ongoing & quantaplus; only an instance run, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods described above, a script input from & quantaplus; on the default input can be determined, which can be determined in the default input. possibilities are:</seg>

<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in this case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconics; select other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconics; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, you select size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user, click on this tool a & lt; start; -day in current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings promotions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the required action. next to the text field is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>

<seg id="2057">Maybe mention mentioning of & quantaplus; for normal users, the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like to like. this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository whether somebody has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to select an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc. language. then you will need to create the docc file. the first part we leave you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 2 = Update 1.html functioned 2 = func2.html-2 = &gt; tag.html-3 = tag.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree is defined by the visible part of documentation in the document tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of docrc file, which is to be displayed in the design of context-sensitive help. for example, if the documentation on the mysql _ fetch _ fetch _ fetch _ Array function, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (like this in your file docc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to be proud of the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources may be sent via email to friends, partners or else to whom are sent. at different places there is an email option, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar code with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all the other & quantaplus; users can be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and used for the release, for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources are guaranteed, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you will have multiple keys, you may need a look. in the dialog New Resource, the input fields will be filled out (URL preview can be empty) and with click of OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP) package (DTEP) package, upload tool bar code, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts, can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the Signification. in case of problems, it can be stopped. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the specification of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; but the creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be needed in the day XML format. there is a simple way to convert a DTD package automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from DTD charging and converting a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. afterwards the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string of the string in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activates, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these fundamental concepts we must first familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to accommodate these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; all of which is selected as global, in common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different materials, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will be available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool bars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be done with particular promotions specially for the files of a certain project. simple, this is the most restricted size. all elements are taken in the folder of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emöglight.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building views, the boxes with information and the tool bar. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">In order to select a context menu with the right mouse button, to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as close the current, other or all boxes, reload, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click to edit the editing area leading to a further context menu regarding the processed documentation, such as basic machining steps (cut / paste / insert), editing the mouse pointer or open file, if the string is under the mouse pointer or open a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor's editor, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert one single day, e.g & lt; you can insert the data for this straight day. now they can add the data for this just one day. if you want a day that has several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate to the information & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and pierce. in the presentation of cardboard boxes are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool which offers & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via right mouse click. actions such as add, removing, upload or delete files from the storage medium can then be displayed in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole webpage & etc; there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates only for corresponding users and templates in projects are only usable in the project. read more templates.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the script languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project is also working here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, you can send further functions, such as the script to start, edit or merge with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by pressing an element, the cursor will be set to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with him, manquickly attributes and namespaces are able to change the contents of all the available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentations site can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the lower end of the window that can be achieved over the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information on each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the market up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (if there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-archive about & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure this in & quantaplus; like any other secure and invite!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; you can adjust a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to get a complete list of options available to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with Starts of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor began to employ the developers of & quantaplus; it would be an independent, extendable market-up languages? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & KDE! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, & quantaplus; that is to be appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above-mentioned claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; development community is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers using an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand productivity almost every task. by the program compressors they can expand & quantaplus; expand, without any scripting language skills. (more about it will find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for quick web development and has quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details about the detailed documentation is associated with help: / quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files which you have opened. this list has changed every time when you open a file that is not on it, the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. see in the section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project approach, will be reported only a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts in the insertion of the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; write, so that it is correct and does not understand the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; encoding, which is the correct path to insert special signs and spaces in & URL; s first line to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches off the block selection. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a character string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed used with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and switching of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main sequence. the problem journalist is activated once you replace the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol old left from the main window. this column allows you to put reading mark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents will appear in the menu after the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens up a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored in the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory to new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphic files to your project folder or subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Download the files in your project on the server. the list of available shipping methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have a further input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project toolbar. these are stored in the project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the tool bar code: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens up a dialog to add a new toolbar. this created only the name. actions must be stored through settings actions or are added to the toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the viewpoint. this deletes not from the hard disk. if you don't delete the tool bar, you will be asked whether you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the loading of toolbars on the main server where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; which you or any other has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own code format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Charging / striving of the dutities of the & DTD; it makes sense if the dutities of the & DTEP is to be risked without the whole & DTEP; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently charged tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog box if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivated the intelligent entry tag tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. smarter means that & quantaplus; the paste is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the listed menu points. click on them. click on a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Choose the syndictation mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identification. very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows, DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document on the basis of selected & DTD; using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switch between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause some time or unpleasant graphics. recommended is the card mode that is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the presentation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an agreement, the corresponding subwindow is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main base and off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue contain any application which use the KHTML Part, including the & Conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behaviour of the Editorch. in the Documentation of & Kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or adding which can modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce an aid in accordance with the image of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, please find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as for example, according to the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically completed.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can see the server address of the machine to which you want to access any local data. either a name (hostname.com.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If one leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote user's adjustment, adaption will be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set rather than standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set rather than standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from local filesystem into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change. if necessary scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are supposed to be integrated into the main folder of the project. if a project is based on new, not connected.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of couches.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can choose the required files by anhaken or, by removing the hemorchens, chambers of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the subwindow profiles or with the keyboard Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder is possible), which are readily ignored in project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, including files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about projection views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">With this purpose, the desired debugger can be selected. at present, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the button. in, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile, by clicking a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details in details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower event of event configuration, one can change event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a previously specified event, such as the sickle of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project which was opened. this behavior can not be found at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, open the project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you are asked whether you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens if you download a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to the files in the project. there you can manage files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are equally possible, however, the entries are opening and open with... in the right verbal context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows for removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and password. this possibility is useful if frequent upload files are needed and the rather unsafe password on the disk option does not come in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be uploaded to different server (or parts of the project) to different server. editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server where the files are to be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should select & ftp;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not run service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password will not be read on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming language can be easily seen in clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and tool bars can be loaded, and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings of toolbars project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this does not only increase productivity, but allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best above the menu tool bar, use and add. adding tool bar is treated below in the adding of tool bar below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set either via context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a new tool bar can be executed, any tool bar rename, or toolbar, which can be specified in the dialogue, which may be displayed if actions on this or other materials are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition, the entries will remove and the action worked that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings Toolbar... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentation, code-cuts and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates in principle as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or any on the system existing directory in the storage room. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you are presented to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary. some examples are displayed in the storage room under global templates. further information about templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentaries. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple report for the purpose and organizes work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is supposed to be inserted in the documents, but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates. you are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File Report as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. watch in the storage room under project facilities.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and store your selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay down onto the manure templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only copy into one template folder. you can use all file management functions for it, such as pulling and transfer or inserting across the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder or in the project file size view to a folder on the right and secure Site template. by default, the project folder will be saved, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project conditions permit a very targeted approach, or dynamic with & PHP; shape, add files or link with them. in addition, you can add some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above explained.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu characteristics. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as Elterrestrial attributes is extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders. if a regular file would be set to disable, unless they are explicit activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you'll probably be found in a regular file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allow earlier or subsequent text for templates in this folder. this could be general head-lines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head lines / footlines a whole presentation already with the matching head lines / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show, right mouse button) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaced the source editor into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch to the source code editor in which the changes in the VPL; editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor at a document that is & PHP; it's not possible to edit the Vohandencer of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor is not necessary to edit the source editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously is enabled. with pressing F9, this mode is already active, the button re-transfer the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; in addition, it can be adjusted between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is required: a small span for fast machine and a large span for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing features are possible, so as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor is created as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document itself. meta-elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or remove. one click into the list allows the change of the content, such as keywords on the column name and keywords key word2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of looking out pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change about the list is exactly as possible in the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules are still not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style pad by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursors is peculiar as in a word Processing, due to arrows, possible. in rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through single-tap and deleted by back-button or remodelity.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The Tags is made in the same way as in the source editor, such as in the source editor, is done. it is to note that the insertion of tags previously inserted in existing identical tags is not removed, each other surrounding anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars like the tables assistant or the listings are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work must be used in this release, the tables or lists of tool bar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the membership changed many changes and simultaneously corrected the entry. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the backlog had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be seen differences in line and changes in white characters. later, any amount of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, copy it simply into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function related & kdiff3; almost to a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people are working independently in one piece of code works and make changes. the original file under the differences-windows enables the resolutions of conflicts and shows the result at the same time. in this editor, you can even edit the results directly. the screenshot is available in three quell files at merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you include the same and merging complete folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the options of today's colour monitors. if you often need to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble anymore, if any one changes the insertion.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folder, then you can complete the tipparwork by using only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Code3 folder 2 file diff3 folder 2-o target folder Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3-o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening communication enables the manual type of filename, select the selection above the file browser (file...) or select one of the most opened file from the list. if you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">On the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merge of folders will be initiated, but if a file is selected, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge is crossed, the input field is active for the target and is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately. you can do this step later in saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text items from the clipboard in the active comparison window. compared with opening, you don't need to select any files, you can easily close the dialog with the departure button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dismantle: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and leave it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file like several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would have to be a relatively big effort. you would like to download and compare only two corresponding files, add them in & kdiff3; download and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can not get out of & kdiff3; drag the text by text in a comparision window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse to rest on the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source code readers are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees the color that distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and commentary, relevant for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individuals.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">Vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. when the line breaks is activated, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparison list) also has a info line with the inscription edition:, the filenames and [tichanges] if you have processed the result. usually, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to the next deleted / unresolved conflict to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two compares are used, any difference can be solved in the same time as a conflict of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window is marked on the line of the group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump in the position in the windows where the group is otherwise not visible.) This group will be highlighted in the color background colour for current area and on the left, a black beam appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic clerging or through manual editing, no other line remaining in the group; this text will be displayed in these lines. this text is not displayed in the final file, nor select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembling conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard, if you have to copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with image capture and mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys, right, high, down, page on, page starting from the beginning, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, siw like you can also use it from other programs. the overflaw column next to the vertical drive bar can also be used by clicking here.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to do. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and overclock mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the links section synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in Section merger and editing the editing window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture upwards / Strg-picture), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image upwards / Ctrl image), or the next / previous conflicts also as a conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished between dissolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you'll need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically shutdown into the clipboard. be careful with this option, as you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-based systems are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-in-feed character\, and Win32-based systems do not use carriage shutters\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line files not with, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files are automatically stored in the end and restored to the next start. (menu adjustment - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with solid width. (on some systems, the dialog can also choose text in variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the selected scripture does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be tested. on these systems the button settings automatically produces an unnecessarily color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press entering or press return, the preceding line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files, & kdiff3; first, all complete identical lines can be ignored in the source files. only during the first step you can ignore white characters. the second step is compares every row. in this step, white signs can not be ignored. also in merging, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car drop down '\' at the end of a row, other again save only one line-in front-side comparison, but then they could be treated with different sizes in page-on-side comparison, but if this option is enabled, but if this option must be disabled, however, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis the numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly comes with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automation-forward mode, this setting is determined, as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need time to time, then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be treated in the chapters to scan folders and perform a merge. check for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already there is an older version, the original version is attached to the Suffix .original file, if already one such backup file will be deleted with the Suffix .original, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; complete and restart the change. (this option is set in KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up globally on the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, the upper adjustment will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences such as special characters treated and interpret. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared to different coencoding and be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can define what coding is to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the process command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output of prefabrication command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a colourless coded transition column. however, you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. according to selection from A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal running column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparision next to each other or another. this can also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide to transfer the files. current file together in the merge menu will also work if you use only two files. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be delivered to this external command, and not the file itself. in & Kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is exactly what makes your requirements. for example, you can use this feature or to correct the setup.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command (see above), then the output of command is used only when you use this prefabrication command. the output of the command is only equal to the line. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind the user is to enable more flexibility in setting the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users don't want to program that. the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl complete.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefabrication command to convert the entry into large letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another manufacturing command for zeiling equal to suitable tention 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Any sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several considerations at once. then you can use semicolon ';' to separate the results from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e'S / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are different in perl some details. where used\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and maintain. further operations only change the data that the line-off-algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-preprocessor is the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences are hidden, you can't notice certain differences and will destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files. for this reason, you can compare and perform complete folder with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a suggestion to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows simulated changes, without having to perform it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... provides selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of single files. you must only open files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target folder was specified, & Kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder you can read a small news window via the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will normally be folded together by clicking on the + / - click or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions, fold and fold all the subdirectories with which you can open all folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file extension is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane in the selected object. in such a case, the merger-action cannot be selected automatically. if the merger is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture is used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as the same as your entire content is identical. then, we also have the same color. in folders, the age is unsignificantly for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, deleting the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, deleting the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A exists, deleting the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults objects exist, the interaction can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults objects exist, the interaction can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicit targets have been specified. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that they are both folders identical. if required for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not the same: merging and save the result in both folder. (the user looks as a visible filename for output file only B; directly after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged, then select & kdiff3; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. While such mistakes cannot be removed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is taken after the other. it's status column indicates whether the merging was successful, and according to other messages if something unexpected should be completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparative method of Full analysis is selected, Kdiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for deleted conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or ode), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the collateral actions (also in all subfolder) you can run the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a target folder, then the three-folder merge mode is used as a target when using two-file interaction, B and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in folder structure. there are some options to be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">In order to bring together all entries: select directories in directory menu or press F7 (key pin). in order to merge only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to conflicting file types, still invalid actions exist, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options run, simulating and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate If you want to see what would happen if you really want to change any changes. you will then receive an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (merge one single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are done with a file, select re-continue directories / continue or press F7. if you are not stored, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3, continues to continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages, allowing you to try out the problem of the problem, or to solve the problematic entry. thus, you have the option to solve another action on entry or to solve the problem in other way before you proceed with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually taken together, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not run together with all entries earlier. even if the interaction were skipped or not stored, these entries will be done as a result. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be remerged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are shown on the specified pattern will be displayed in the Elementtree. you can split the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default: *. folder do not need to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the Elemental tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the Elemental tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are ignored by CVS. many autmatisch generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be specified specifically using a .cvsignore file. (see below info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files are a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elemental tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to folder: if the option is switched off, the links like normal files are treated and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions. a link to yourself would lead to an end-off loop and crashes down;) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unilateral, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders beyond a slow network, it is possibly faster to compare only changing date and file size. however, this speed advantage is a certain degree of safety. please use caution. this option is discharged in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality's change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. that can be useful when copying the changeset date. please use caution. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are identical. also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is posted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file as an action. (this is considered unsafe, because the other file is not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is posted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, the original version is changed with the .original extension already exists, this will also delete the normal interaction of single files, not just the merge file. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view remains visible above the merge file; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can turn off the window frames on the window menu and turn off through changing between directory & text window, between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, you can also download a single file from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be closed, and the file will not run once again, when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you read the directory: directory menu: new reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of Kio-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an ftp server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und.or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank, &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows. then there's always a file as link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions, or change of change. therefore, the permission is possible, or the change date from the original. (note this option is only possible for local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of purpose is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first to start the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part displays from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part file, & kdiff3; the names of the original files in the Unified format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the queror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. also, please note that this does not work properly, if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now is the compression) already exists. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've used GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by using in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone the way or get it so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script for the correct PREFIX to KDE. in default, KDE can not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you can find further information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines will be classified as identical; but if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be identical as identical. iF similar lines (next to Each other, this would this place finish this would be the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this important information is necessary, however, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design extra a file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src linens; published and the text can not extinguish. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to create differences. even more highlighting would be confused and dismissing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use & kdiff3 functions, you need & KDE; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install diffuse on a system with & KDE; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have problems with compiling. however, difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or resettalt-removing) copied into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or resettalt-insert) add the text from the clipboard in the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all orders are not in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to read about changes to these options with the updates on updating.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences feature. this also includes that identical files are not included in the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are missing after the merger. (the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version.) This option is posted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already available). if the lines are already available, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Default in default, this option is deactivated. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the workspaces, to stop her size or move it. this works both within a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the current applications. applications can be selected and even move on desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; click on an application within & Kpager. however, there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the application minimize, maximize, on desktop and beam. the commands are the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. only appears when it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved inside & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the & Kpager will appear; the name of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Check this field leaves the & Kpager; the numbers of virtual workspaces are shown together with its name, the names are provided with ordinates, & eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager can be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; in some other Windows applications appear; horizontally shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontal row and vertically in a vertical series, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniature in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in size, display windows as symbols or with its content. moreover, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and followed by switching from switch switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can't be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Do not open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't need to apply or apply to your system administrator. in this file you need to use the key windowTransparent mode and provide this one value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click on the same position as soon as the mouse pointer is due for a while. it is intended to help people suffering the RSI syndrome (repetitive G-Injury Syndrome) and each mouse click pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click on the same spot. it's meant to help people suffering the repetitive strain Indies (RSI) Syndrome and each mouse click pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse, and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may cause pain that are linked with the use of your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even if & kmousetool; pain helps prevent using the mouse, it is used against pain that may be used because of the use of the mouse, it may be useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result may fall differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent understanding is activated, & kmousetool; a break, after the pressing of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can run the brigaze by pressing a mouse button. this mode requires a little exercise, but you get accustomed to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must be cloaked after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is switched on, the shift field is switched off (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting for the mouse button, before the mouse button is reset, if there is no evidence of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now is enabled by clicking button shift. this function is activated, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. this movements are stored in the $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt file; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can turn & KDE; to move the reaction time. open the sound system and click here the Rider General. there's a sliding sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & KDE; this function is currently only available under & KDE; this function is currently only available at GNOME or other window frames, please find the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values back when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button Apply, the settings will be reset on the status after the last pressures of applicators.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially using the default settings. in particular, the smart motion should first be switched off. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later go to the smart motion.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times by & KDE; at speeds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which doesn't link to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can use the mouse to such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse goes, you should clean your mouse. it's usually quite easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if it's just a shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool does not mean; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists, that you can run a mouse click. this is reset the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor up to place where you want to make it. but pardon't let the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you don't want to make a key click on a neutral area. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover-line of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart motion, but I don't create it to edit the lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart motion is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you handle it. it is very well possible to move it into the clipboard or move to any other action, where you want to move the mouse with suppressed mouse button. but there will probably be some problems to prepare. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart phone if you just start to use & kmousetool; check out the text instead of a mouse click on the end of the text area while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always be played every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button is played by sound like a mouse click. so you can also use the intelligent Verpush button. later you can also use the intelligent mouse click without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you need to install the Xtest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; actuated the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer briefly confused. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, and those who have been suffering from the mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed, before it is sent to the program of speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid certain defects of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the works of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktats; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be drawn up all of the other orders and will hold these orders. if the output of the Screen-Reader is read, orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings are the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor will be too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next door priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the messages. during you & eg; you can welcome a long text on a website. & KDE; -notifications are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications which uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no special drinkability.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four of the orders are shown in queues, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen readers, while & ktats; just one of them reads, this output will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Edit the text and give it to the next filter. at the moment there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are done as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacing parts of a text by other text. the replacement parts may be delivered either as words or regular expressions. it is provided with pre-defined list of character filters such as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in delivery of & ktats; are some XSLT files to translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the text of the text, or depending on the program that sent the text on & ktats; if you have set a female voice on the card card, you can read text from KDE messages. read it about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a language issue. if the filter is established that his rules are not applicable, he will continue to keep the text in the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; notification to & ktats; sent them by all activated filters, which were set up on the side down. processing is done in the order in the list of top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of common normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filters will be moved from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of the filter, and there will be the further introductory dialogs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparative pattern. if these samples are found in the text, the text will be exchanged with the corresponding replacement text. large and small-slip will not be regarded as comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is shown in the shown order from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file, save the current list or delete. download a list of a file, the entries will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker for the text order is one of the listed languages here. click on the button to select a list of languages. you can also choose multiple languages when you click on the mouse click the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is listed here, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can type several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can use the program qdbus with the program qdbus; the & DBus; numbers must be blasted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 is available, you may only enter.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The character set filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box type filter should be specified. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string of character filters uses regular expressions in the form\\ s Word\\ s. The words must be limited by dividing character (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Select & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; you can find out in ambiguls package.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to accumulate the regular expression on the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you specify the characteristics of your talk. if the text is fulfilled above the filter conditions, the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the same button. click on the button to show the dialog box selection.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses a adaptive module architecture for language synthesizers. if you want & ktops; for use of another synthesizers, use the developer team in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktats; you need to compile a current development environment from KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages of kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source codes of & ktats; you can download and install the tarball from the source code, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you're using & ktats; first, check first if a speech-dispatcher is working properly with your language synthesizer. for this purpose you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktats; who uses the program of speech dispatcher. the program kttmsgr is said to be developed so that the establishment of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script of the SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is distorted into individual propositions. the user can carry out, repeat, hold or break the output.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filter (SDB filter). SBDs can begin text in single sentences, as only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the entire text order. thus, you can also stop or cancel all text files, even if the language synthesizers do not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here, you will see the set-on detection filter. when the first start of & ktats, you will automatically set up a propositional control filter. you can change its settings or add further propositional processing filters, but will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest way you will learn to select the device selection selection. turn on the box selection, change some properties, and check how the selection of the talk is changed. of course, you have to set out more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then you can begin with reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then keep text orders on the card card orders or abort, even if the language synthesizer cannot support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal propositional detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr. it cannot be switched off, just away. do not change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional detection filters compare text with a regular expression of proposition and paste a tabulatory mark (decimal code 8) on the set limits (table characters are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard cross-border filter is retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-Filter will never be applied to & KDE; messages (farms), warnings, news, or the output of screen refunds.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal proposition cross-level filters, you can add this again by replacing the default _ sbdrc file.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktats; check first if your language synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions that you have received with synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer whose source code is obvious. the quality of the votes is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported. with many voices, you can adjust volume, talk speed and pitch with & ktats.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help you find in the instructions that are delivered with Festival. would you like to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code from the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions regarding the transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice defines the festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage stage. unzip the software in the festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you enter the Russian voices, you need to enter the msu _ ru _ nsh _ diphone (8-bit) encoding, such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions as first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the coding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic, such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The festival can be used together with the & mbrola; synthesizer and then takes the audio output. this creates the audio output. the & mbrola; -program and the & mbrola; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & mbrola; no complete language playsystem. & mbrola; generated language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. txt2pho can also produce diphone. txt2pho can also be created from German lyrics Diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure, additional Wrapper-code is added to the festival, to use & mbrola; -voices to language synthesis. note that the & mbrola; moods do not be installed in the & mbrola; file folder, but in the file festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the management interface, the routines and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to enable the users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf file; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched through a selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu; be started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device does not display and allows setting the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed with installing and installed. networking devices will be added later, the drivers must be loaded through the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this system tries to automatically detect the used platform at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the suspension selection is offered. it is the platform made from the list that will not meet the distribution and the Releasestand best. through marking the setting non-once-quire the definition can be taken permanently. when the next start of the network settings will then select this selection automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings are possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are shown, changing the settings can only be viewed, changing the button mode mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to input the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The riders network interface serves to manage the network appliances in the system. all available network devices are displayed. all the available network interfaces can be performed in the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setup settings can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button to expand the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are collected from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information will send all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the select list may be selected either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual manual, without DHCP or BOOTP can be set up in TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initiates the network interface for boats. if the initialization is not allowed, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. with ping in the & Console, you may notice whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Networking devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs. rollout of a network device is done through selection from the list and click of interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Networking devices can be activated or switched off as required. disable a activated network device through selection from the list and click on interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other subscriptions.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than a network interface there, the interface must be selected on the web where the gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org lists DNS to this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the namespace portion of the equator solution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be converted into a list with buttons or removal in the list using buttons or outputs.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button closure... from the group calculator to naming solution, a DNS server can be added. it will be displayed in the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button. the entry is then inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator on the naming solution, select one entry and then click on the button Edit.... It will display the dialog pane.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of particularly well-known machine describes the IP address IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used with boats if no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains some records, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still existing version of IP should replace 4 in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host computer, and click adding.... The dialog of New alias is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known machine and add the button. if the known machine has several alias names, de button add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">There can be one of the following tasks, then with click of OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings used in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to enable changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient when & KDE is installed and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download and install the rpm package with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphic surface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient; not, but in addition, development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace ongoing knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 never has large spread. of IPv6, it is expected to pass through the near future. currently, this description is currently concentrating on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator that can be used or if available, DHCP may be used. definitely, the IP address can't be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose, to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks most often addresses are used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is set on 255.255.255.0, so all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for IP-recharge.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf, are affected, and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified by DSL connections, so it does not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as specified.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in SuSEconfig. therefore, another stand can occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape was included. in the Status Bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the bank can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the connection must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of the symbol to the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it refers to the tape file using the tape file using the tape file. this process will delete all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make a safety profile to make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder, in which the fuse is to be done. the list of transparent files will be updated automatically according to the required work file.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For any file, which are listed below securing files, the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder which are stored on other file systems, can be used separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Carry out a mental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last incorporate backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files saved, which have changed ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since the last incorporate backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt;; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings via menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rew version of the tape menu.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command is attached to the drive. in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, & kdat tries to lock the tape drive. maybe this setting is not working with all the band drives.</seg>

<seg id="2934">If the option is switched to change & kdat; the hardwarding block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size can be sent to your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formed, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the file's content is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is: seconds, whereby the name of the complete name of the system is formatted on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch, which has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act with mental fuses.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer viewer can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows information about your system or where the system allows information about information about problems relating to information on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kssystem log; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & kssystem log; is a simplified representation of the protocol files. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information on issues related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, using which the protocol-files can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog servers and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and will be explained in the other chapters of this book.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in next chapter of this manual page.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - system protocol has started to open, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have not started using system verwalnuts. this protocol can usually be found in folder / var / log, for the normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar, in order to filter out after a selected criterion or on the selected string bar. the list of the log-lines will be automatically changed, so that only protocols will be displayed next to the selected filters. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string search engine is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another record, of course, to select another record. in the protocol-file system protocol, select the column process, and use it out in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent from this process or have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting, and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a striking colour than protocol lines of stage. the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or on the cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process. it can then be useful for example if you would like to investigate the output of a particular command such as the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subscriptions. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindow. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more information about the information sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Log & kssystem log; in addition to the following folder of the & KDE; Subversion Archives: kssystem log; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program start in & Linux; world. and that's why it is easier to use, more powerful, and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to go down historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on system V init, without a reinstallation and reformat. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start at the high-drive system or change to another Runlevel. such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems own this file, even if you don't want to use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. be very careful if you've got something through, then you come to restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it involves a K, the script will be called using the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server-level, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; can also run a user-level, that is & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they move an entry from the range of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted when you move these into a new range. in order to copy them on a new Runlevel, you need to select explicitly copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no option to re-produce records that have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. therefore, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the various working ranges (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection Ober- or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. use the tab button by repressing the input button to accept the changes, or press the Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries will require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise, they are saved by & ksysv. otherwise it will be saved in a local csysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts up constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you will need to edit additional files in / etc. please read the details inside the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services are launched in these distributions, but is simplified the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use other distribution files: please check whether all configuration files are required (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (eg & eg; Apache and httpd) just quit without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After having made changes, you need to save this. either use the corresponding symbol of toolbar or entry saving in the File File.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user group list. to edit the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings. only if you can add limited limitation (Quota) for users, where shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears if Shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limited (Quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable to the file quotas user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters, the limited number of data in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs information about the group's premixes of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user, can be found in the field of Primular Group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, add adding the user or group or click on the appropriate adding button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the lilo boot manager, remove, remove, and modify the time to add the standard operating system, add the standard operating system, remove, change the operating system, remove, change and more.</seg>
