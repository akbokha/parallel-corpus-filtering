although I had visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors read and operated by American music .
in fact , this country had such an excellent impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ student who was the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admi@@ ration for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you are always who you are and it &apos;s easy Acc@@ ept@@ ance in a community of equal people .
I had even written a very warm love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as he is moving with its bott@@ len@@ tic@@ ity .
he never stops behind the mountain as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks of his former colleague , declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless people responded to his testimony and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won the Republican presidential election , was the highest number ever reached by the party of nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and elec@@ tors not with people in line , which I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic programme , the people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
he did not agree with the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced during Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for their lives in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace , and my colleagues helped to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much of my career .
these people and those by them em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe due to its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either convicted to over@@ see their rac@@ ism and fan@@ atism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as a ra@@ mp@@ ant .
to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful , suggest@@ ing an in@@ ability to understand those who take action on a different way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them are , for Tr@@ ump agreed , because they want to recover control over a country that they dis@@ ap@@ point ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . ) . : as much as &quot; rebellion of the White against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties &quot; ; wor@@ ding from white in An@@ play to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , what the great Van Jones called , exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always , America means everyone .
for this country , as his president , elected twice the son of an Ken@@ y@@ an@@ er , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : to hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ru@@ der , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he spoke on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; we ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who isn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and lou@@ dly &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was diagnosed .
the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played at both locations , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; a old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical music ) plays in the municipality : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has an opportunity to overcome their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and Ban@@ den violence .
but that after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project , and the youth had such a rare hop@@ el@@ essly .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with shining eyes and play in the gu@@ bel you meet day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically up at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of capital - on instruments which are made of re@@ produced waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments which consist of local fixed waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling plant under F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ i@@ ds viol@@ ins , viol@@ ate , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura to start the first time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place , in which the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown somewhat , which he never seen before : a waste made of waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and calls itself The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ scapes Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest , like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ scapes Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspi@@ rational spectacle of garbage music around the world .
the orchestra also played his music from Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically reported international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to common use of content .
in West Africa , then it was known that this ship had already been running illegal fishing in Liberia before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries have risen accordingly and little incl@@ ined , a legislative complaint to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ press@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles , quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries , which you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team who discovered the ship during the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then sold out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
at the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of the pl@@ undering of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , crosses the criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the Premier were driven out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are equal and working together . you can exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to exp@@ ire . illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm the del@@ ici@@ ally equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , with the information between different countries , the actions nowadays occur in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
here , the individual countries can exchange , for example , exchange licenses , news for susp@@ icious activity or details , which have noticed or experienced during a harbour area .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea , through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to know the ships that fishing in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such that indicate that a ship will make his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish license , where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch , can be found on the basis of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that even the numbers could not be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth finan@@ cially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ber company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to gain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the illegal fisher@@ man who penet@@ rate the East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats , absent for the region &apos;s commercial fishing catch . among these also those illegal fishermen .
regarding their practices and actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of imag@@ ined species and fishing protected in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ sto@@ cky control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal conclusion is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks distributed to spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it fle@@ eing and found refuge .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight against crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to get susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to push the illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also provides technical support with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be used by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information carriers . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that can be displayed satellite data and can be displayed in every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get rid of the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that makes simply sense &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ ling their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at the global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on ships with a global system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also d@@ eter them .
ships that have been conf@@ using without license and have hardly expected to have consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i involved a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 found the inspec@@ tors there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose deployment is banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries have also noticed these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we have now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are an educational subject . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear per year by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined together to meet the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they fight against the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with safety , the goal is to allow more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph in Somalia : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under a false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to run tow@@ ed nets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking a strong sign for Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative approach to protect the oceans is actually working in the entire cos@@ mos .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s motion to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the lead by gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central North of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians , through an acute deficiency of food and medications .
many representatives of the Opposition saw a fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the cancellation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Díaz , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the context of the government as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and greenhouse gases are estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum aimed to reti@@ re for many as the only way to conquer their institutional structures and to close a new government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral officer of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) agreed to the majority of representatives of the Opposition and a march to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan government , on November 3 , should continue to continue blocking the refer@@ end@@ ums to the office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide strike , and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the march which are published in real time , testify among others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cri@@ es to this Vene@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

great waves beat the news about police repression in the central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira state :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no skir@@ ts , because you could see something else , what many nation@@ alists don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic , which forms the extent of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the requirement for a mandate procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

the march always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported to the media they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or buy .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and was published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba .
as a meanwhile , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in Cordoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes was investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not looked for his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal operation of military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family of life for 34 years .
in the situation , I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander of the intelligence department of 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the under@@ lies that was indicted for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who knew in over the years the extent of atro@@ cities , which he had experienced as a boy , and said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent about his child , and how this child cho@@ oses a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take part in the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was married to a boy who made battle sports .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
pass merely pointed out that they do not lead you one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Labor Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I &apos;d become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was fine . for so my father had pulled me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there you are tortured the prisoners &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bit wrapped in a ceiling and told me to carry it into the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he looked at an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in , and saw a couch , tortured on human beings .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that it was attached to an end of a cable . the other end has been fast@@ ened by the body of the person who was right there .

the smell there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were spotted with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried the eye to the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lopez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian which was also indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down on the face - all were in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance aw@@ aked people still in the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ est thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this , because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was also indicted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , led by the former Fol@@ lowing chambers .
the way that you came in here is the way , on which the Ent@@ ente came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number of the process of human beings .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ phr@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stu@@ ffed things with home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear that war yield a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military jun@@ ctions , which one assumes a enemy that is fighting .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this V@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime , and I answered : and thou shou@@ ld@@ est lift the cars on the street ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , stroke me , and cried , saying ,
if you walk so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover of wool . I had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a pity for this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to say .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am getting older , I re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , you know the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what is the body to disappear ?
why do children escape ?
one day my father brought a girl with her own mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they would have just been able to bring them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families where they could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act , which one can do to man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced again , they removed machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and hid somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , showing my father , was created during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt embarrass@@ ed , and asked me , for the entire bu@@ oy@@ ancy patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , was really good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crime , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can tell me that I am pre@@ set . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest at the end of the process .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes charges in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , killing torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the representation of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years of age , more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera proceedings started due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 signat@@ ories were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court imposed life sentences ranging in 28 cases and in nine cases of pen@@ alties ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of originally 54 accused were killed during the process .

Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argentine organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of men who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research took 39 years .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error occurred at a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend its driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Centre in which one can extend its driving licence , last month witnesses a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also translated with great backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic displays in the input area and in the building itself .
machining of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media .
the error was a translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local newspapers .
the liberal daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the correct English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ fecture pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already included in the text which they had received from trans@@ lators and that the translation was not checked before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; I feel really sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese news service J @-@ Cast News focused on the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but definitely to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 . this represents a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the number of seniors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased .
the nam@@ ing not so @-@ called repor@@ ters published in the version of article comments on the light that show how pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So that is the translation of the translation , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case of breast cancer . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate for example from the English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be missing understanding of survival , cost @-@ based , or the relatively low number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies who have no foreign employees themselves have to make translations , but then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic recording , which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used in styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto City now uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and customs measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users found that they have no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are equally accessible .
other online broad@@ casts were also organized by protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ position@@ ist groups who refu@@ te the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Díaz , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is en@@ capsul@@ ated , and recommended users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet@@ pages Venezu@@ elan providers are again imprisoned .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been reporting on protests over protests since 2014 . then , the Commission on T@@ elecommunic@@ ation claims them with fin@@ es and closure , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable television and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amaz@@ ingly , that the still cheaper is to buy as two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ caster . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet providers can sometimes use DNS . it is a technology that promp@@ tly answer the DNS servers of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server answers f@@ law@@ ed or denied the request by calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ot@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was discontinued on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who was transmitted live in Caracas during the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on shipment .
although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , so the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ists will always make access to multi@@ media coverage on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become a slave to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other cri@@ adi@@ ta that were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by the author , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lies cows , Fall Schools &quot; ) , processed and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not working together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she returned to the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride , and she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ tas was called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a great family with little money over@@ lays her least @-@ year @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned yet , is that the children will have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and sacrifices of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you can &apos;t lift up .
this is called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after finishing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ adi@@ ta , guarantees in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
it is , on the other hand , the family , who close their daughter in faith that they may improve their education to improve their position in society and make something of yourself &quot; can give to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes care of the girl with faith and justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would not be an apprentic@@ eship , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never know about that .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret places in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ ar , her body showed traces of fierce battles . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the budget of the former military @-@ affiliated Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as an officer at the number of residents .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested as long as a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered a deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
she stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society in the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there were &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which terms boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a generous investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before dish , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in history is a case from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as a workforce , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k where her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to go all working and started to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to make money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn .
it stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days , they puri@@ fied the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house@@ keeper when eating out of the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the master , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in a few depar@@ ting of the Hou@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and leading news from opposition groups like &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ators of the dictator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he held them for intelligent , but he didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master &apos;s house had someone who listened to Jesus , while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they were able to lose their formation , that she might lose , she explains .
it was , however , completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid by them with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ crimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the scar@@ city of which Cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed , when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite anyone at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clear that I had belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can find vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning staff and children &apos;s maids in Paraguay .
the Ad@@ ministr@@ ator of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city center in As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
learning to learn .
please write to you .
starting from Monday , when possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a young girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the national inner that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the display was once again :
dear friends , I found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness testimony of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice dating from the Spanish conquest ) , read the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and to support Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination , that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery , where they become easy victim for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding of phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill to sign Egyptian users social media , register at the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators regarding the use and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is adopted by Parliament , users and social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up that it has been commissioned to share social media citizens .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users and user would have to register on the website of the site with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , consists of local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed if it is believed that the design cannot be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to make the registration of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register , that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and pat@@ rons of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a user name for a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far , that such plans consist .
experts and experts are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have strong emphasis on the technical capacities and understanding of any authority nor authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they control physical public and private rooms that could also be done online .
if I take it seriously then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to carry out a trial process .
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the leg@@ islat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees , before it goes into the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that there is no different nar@@ ration on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliamentary report , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative proposal against Cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , which was destined for a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who were guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest against protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the Nor@@ theast of Iraq work the Tier@@ schutz@@ haus H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the Belgian Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less lo@@ ot , endangered .
why is this certain type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza up in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the free game is small and goes against zero . as the team found in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks down into pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passionate to show another side of their country , which is not only from war and conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and training programs for six years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and sets out that protected zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region has been set up .

at the beginning of March 2017 , documented by the nor@@ theastern Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those of the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a different pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to van@@ ish , because the tsun@@ ami had to disappear whole ch@@ urch@@ yard from the map .
even in addition , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows a local point of view which progres@@ sively met six years later to rebuild the life of the local community .
the detailed report of the newspaper incorpor@@ ates both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
residential construction in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( in the country ) , which was finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light .
however , for six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated of containers of capacity were still stri@@ cken to res@@ ett@@ les in a final spare time , even six years after the disaster .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
nearly 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in the year 2011 . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation produced by the disaster in containers were moved into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 Schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , will open its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed its operation in Fukushima .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , were dra@@ gged .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fukushima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands of Fukushima in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear restricted zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered further , but here , Fukushima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist arri@@ vals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster . Fukushima however , only 75 percent can be seen here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to make their living .
is the local population being prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . they questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their emp@@ ower has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
the survey caused that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken action to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough for cat@@ astrop@@ hes was done .
as it stands for those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the location of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukushima .
Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic circumstances which had to be experienced in Japan .
out of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fukushima , had been moved to long @-@ lasting spare homes .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
the most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres , older than 50 years old . you must compete in proper containers , because efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , which speak another language , these differences seem to be larger than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one often know that one more un@@ ites more than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which she felt very strongly associated with someone over voice and country borders .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a wide spread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
physicians em@@ itted this Saturday and delivered him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of police officers , who attacked with a b@@ ail . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the procedure was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his percussion on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer tested by a prot@@ esters and end up to the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , distributed the video in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and further sanctions shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
the clip shown below is one of the attack on Mat@@ eus starting on the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is located in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
to police force . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publishing with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás into memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence . here , the military police have been killed by his father , because he was accused of having attacked the Occup@@ y Movement of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva that has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman that sm@@ itten him with a b@@ ail .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was a brutal police raid against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were set up in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
S &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in force on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media is tra@@ cked out by the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo stri@@ ves targeted targeted about a broken glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo their cover pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a built @-@ in bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic foundation , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this is necessary to recognize if one is strictly protected against any form of atomic damage .
here , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd imp@@ lications of absurd violence , and the typical violence of the military police are given by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the Re@@ duc@@ ts For@@ ced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed nearly hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the ethnic community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a Central - in Spanish conc@@ ierge - known , regardless of that there is no notable sugar se@@ ams on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were cut in the sugar cane mill .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the job .
others re@@ signed and com@@ mute daily to factories , which still gr@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ v@@ eter@@ eter@@ an open every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis is not rob@@ bed in the sugar cane industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he heard that there are sugar@@ cane factories in the east of the region , which are after long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene is reminis@@ cent of the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar@@ cane industry has already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country in a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off ?
the old platform of the church had already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories remaining , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain , according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go down with safety in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the shut@@ down came from a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all those questioned are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first round year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed to the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ sat and the date distinguished .
everyone was signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were increasingly frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the closed factory for two years and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar@@ cane mill . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for the retirement in another complex that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services , which were generated in the municipalities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar@@ cane factories
sugar@@ cane has only been extracted very high since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , I learned that many things will change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory was closed , or rather , when they began to refuse it , they also listened to the road to asph@@ alted , this is dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not once used for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty harv@@ ests bring a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a tra@@ geous person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to R@@ ente with 65 years of age , not because it is lack of power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youth use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and maintain his own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses the permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities in Canada do deal with topics that are important to them . they do they do with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour since 2014 , workshops will bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e hip hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is saying that the young particip@@ atory in talks , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ respon@@ sive , &quot; or whatever it comes to the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actor .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered .
the cases were largely not resolved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to conv@@ ey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations language .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help of Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in a tran@@ scription , also a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to continue my days on earth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the day you &apos;ll take our cry
because we lost our way in life as youth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe we will rise to one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and continue with our youth
so , they can do that , for what it is appointed to the Creator

plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
plastic dishes ( open access ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes before almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly are on the menu , will be in close proximity to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( a lot of food , &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each food that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even re@@ lie@@ ve them anymore . a new trend is turned into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
when Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ i .
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ made decorative cell tapes , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten collec@@ ts , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ oting fridge for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of eating positions is becoming increasingly rising .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , which keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming .
some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and mol@@ yb@@ den@@ um of dried salmon .

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking , &quot; in Mexico , the fi@@ sts and drinks are regularly reflected in statistics . this mirror does not reflect the extent of human tragedy that fight against this struggle .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or to the con@@ greg@@ ations , who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender @-@ Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) that shall give this sacrifice to a voice and stories of people who directed the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ ons .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organised crime can not only be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the Pain &apos;s Pain
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is seeking secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father only one day , her four brothers , her husband and two of her neph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today to the task that we asked to go and go to graves after the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you have to pay the insurance of my father , but it does not have paid them out because that demand a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
to explain why the editors &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show faces of those who pose a fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the leaders .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a rec@@ ess of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider power as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I know illness and sensation journ@@ alism now for several years now .
I am passing every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or acts of specialists .
it takes me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I &apos;m the only ones who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be considered normal or considered normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old C@@ ousin thinks he will be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) , if it &apos;s big . and it is also not normal that humans will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me this is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who have fear , that something happens to them as well .
I see our weakness if stories become naked numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to talk to stay away from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still are silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months of com@@ press@@ ors in the main city district : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes how armed crimin@@ als spent money for month money from their business until they didn &apos;t just destroy the business , but also their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you lost and remember how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you .
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days , if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ ro@@ oted feelings , but the answers is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is an orph@@ an and he tells us to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tortillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with this .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was already over two years ago when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father had been shot dead by armed men from a past car .
when Bryan was born in Bryan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social issues in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the public prosecutor &apos;s office included 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day .
these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories are still living in view of a new headlines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender @-@ Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , to represent the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages where it ver@@ ts , contain images where violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to exp@@ ose a rum@@ or , or to exp@@ ose a fake .
but what is the years after something has emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to exist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading to describe trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Do not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions concerning our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crosses the village San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ le around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa had been neglec@@ ted in the second biggest country for years and was devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous pillar of impact holes that were difficult to ride .
trag@@ ically , it fell to the fuel tank .
the government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football world@@ cup .
houses were scattered and destroyed bodies in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the di@@ vin@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ more photos of the incident form the dre@@ aming scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of hol@@ low bodies which co@@ ves on the ground , while people have a look at .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was ti@@ f@@ ished several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but it cannot be attributed to trage@@ dies as well as events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ab@@ le@@ ak@@ ian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and customs .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the reason for the attack was also uns@@ ett@@ led , but the army plant in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DRC appeared again , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chief use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of errors ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further bring personal comments , such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined together with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some of burning .
while others reported to the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported like the following based on these descriptions with photos from the DRC :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page that was fal@@ sely claiming President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrated this information .
the entry fee , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , the AFP as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ a His saying , but did not make the image taken from the DR Congo in connection .
the world wide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
a controversial picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the discussed picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and community representatives as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have been for@@ warded to false reports , others tried to exp@@ ose the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have given examples of mis@@ leading use and brought them associated with their respective countries , based on which side they had been published . in this way , we want to display the range of clear@@ er than by the language alone .
from the below listed countries ( which were also connected together in some cases ) several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false cou@@ plings from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange coloured countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available with the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has posted in an online discussion forum posted in an online discussion forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a Th@@ reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also ob@@ serves the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions concerning the intention of the people and the involved trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known if the original report contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am as this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly clearly did not see pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who do this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the correct use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot;
this article gives attention to the continued emergency of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but cited the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of publication of our article .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; lots of fun !

the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this site used the image as a proof of that Muslims killed Nig@@ erian Christians .
this asser@@ tion was ref@@ unded by a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a inhabitants of the Alt@@ stad@@ t@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message to his page to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DRC was divided as a proof for the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussions .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a dis@@ miss@@ able use of the DR Congo , with one part of a blo@@ gger , the claims against the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to del@@ ays to del@@ ays , as the photos were used im@@ properly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a judge what she acted as &quot; deliberately f@@ aked messages and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake pictures of rum@@ ors that are used up speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to state that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other otherwise ( which is often common by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ atty A@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и@@ л@@ о@@ т@@ а@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ а &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the image of the DR Congo NOT shows Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page insi@@ sted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ a came into being in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now , has explicitly declared that the image is not taken by the kill@@ ings but it claims that it was a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te its connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Congo image appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ b@@ anded a discussion among Muslims after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . however , the messages that were linked to them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the target was to direct attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacres , it turned into circulation , and discussions like this in Vietnamese and declared it at the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message that was included in the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of Clar@@ et@@ tin missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos appeared .
there are other confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , Ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points to tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data income with UR@@ Ls and time / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only considerably after the original disaster in 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that move these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions regarding the silence in relation to the murdered victims of Christians through Muslims or - in defense of Muslims - the murdered victims of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second questionnaire uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued at a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can &apos;t give these images to longer faith .
with social media , there are s@@ alty people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally contributed to the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger@@ ants this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it comes back from images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent pictures readers and viewers are looking to feel the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , study , such as for@@ ci@@ ble media ) .
while there are things to discuss non@@ violent presentations in the news media , fact , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will need to think thoroughly about the situation , in which a picture is somewhat sug@@ ary , which can actually be used in the context or completely mis@@ use species .
any investigation into a false assignment should also take into consideration how internationally they can .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
such words are in each language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ speak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ v@@ esa ) .
but everyone resist stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression suff@@ ices not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ba you for your parents in recognition of how you stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth you feel after the sun has grown in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they ent@@ s@@ ne@@ ak other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite movies here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the Sri Lanka Island is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon which is usually set in late May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
after a statement by the disaster of the disaster of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing for the floods and slaughter .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence .
the rainfall left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas went back slowly .
health and hygiene products represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still non @-@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos have an impression of the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ ardian crisis , Save the Children , after further rain fail@@ ures are already on the way .
this morning , Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in the floods , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da was also flooded with G@@ alle , because of yesterday over@@ driven water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .

the Tax@@ ir@@ che @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed users to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance service and donations . these were then sent to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ic Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which included more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions by flood and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , they bring residents in need in need of security and help assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the Sri Lan@@ kas population is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March , 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next turn , we confirm rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ iter@@ ate par@@ ol@@ ises against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looked at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their performance .
they de@@ com@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that once Muslims , which as I don &apos;t fit there , are mus@@ li@@ fied .
ab@@ mus@@ li@@ mi@@ z@@ ated
I do not stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come in a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western launch , religion Rum@@ is deleted , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one exists in the re@@ construc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims , which have been colonial books since centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is intended for the dark man to fear and the exotic woman that one should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said broke out the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to stand today .
they continue our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I have been working for thirteen years in the Intelligence industry and I have seen how this powerful , faulty s@@ cars will domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this Nar@@ ra@@ tively overs@@ had@@ ows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are inhi@@ bited to bear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group prac@@ tising his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it also predic@@ ts that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been brought to slaves with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this nar@@ rative is occupied by our collective pre@@ fabri@@ cation , deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Si@@ kh men and children are often an@@ tim@@ ental attacks and sh@@ ik@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell you and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or in alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are in the highest grade of the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents were to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard into the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American st@@ ems from Bangladesh named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ignor@@ ant Muslims and Americans .
but am I a sad Muslim and American woman now ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or bear my hand@@ ker@@ chi@@ an who wear all Muslims - &quot; from respect of Pep@@ p@@ si W@@ utz . &quot;
I am kid@@ ding , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ at@@ or@@ ans with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to stri@@ ve to combat far widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money @-@ makers , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell you and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a foreig@@ ner , who cuts a head@@ scarf with a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms the belonging to our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity that is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional Mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : believe , behavior , and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf that I am the Muslim , if it could look through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that will separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the Koran , which are called the Koran and called the Q@@ uls .
I repeat three times each of them .
therefore , I beg you that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil which you cannot see .
my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging to my grandmother is the image of my grandmother with her sisters ; as they win a competition in the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades .
it is the picture of her that I &apos;ll close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost fail .
to be Muslim , to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as she has taught me to refer to God , Allah is what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over centuries - was formed by a &quot; Empire &quot; of colonial society , which has founded a company with the name hon@@ estly British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a profound meaning to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow and hear that men are not crying , but at the same time to see that my sin@@ cer@@ ely grandfather wept .
when he writes books on modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was wonder@@ ing about his family , in the middle of India , he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first air@@ her@@ edi@@ cs in history was subjected to a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ er of the British Empire , referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before it was airplanes , he travelled into more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people , our unforgettable family goes back into our unforgettable history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one American Muslim means to be aware that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that if a tragedy we@@ ars the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is four times more reported than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by an liberated black slaves .
it means that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this land .
it means Malcolm X to call an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and , if we speak black life .
an American woman , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them on others .
the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot;
to be a mother , to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people will establish itself on this branch structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists of the Muslim Brotherhood creatures which began with President Bush and expanded by President Obama .
it exists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immig@@ rant , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders over people from just countries which it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and nebul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely by Arab and Muslims .
it is the wars that we perform and the bombs we cast on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we share , and due to those that we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and bes@@ ought them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the con@@ sensus that we must lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades to detect the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous expression , which we are in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that tries to capture our multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ ge ; the vir@@ g@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster authors print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional Muslim @-@ American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time , where we are located .
and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now exists the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have done Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by having created the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years ago it had not been given ; now they rule great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history of which I was not aware of my daughter , as I was now my daughter , but that made me a Muslim Muslim today .
things I left here like a snake lane in my speech .
things maybe aw@@ aken , as in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that makes humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find con@@ cre@@ ations within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
however , these are not terms of which we usually throw in our schools around us or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I tell this about this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and human being enth@@ r@@ alled by the pro@@ cure of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , in front of four decades even Scientific of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions concerning the role of its , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; others &quot; because the employment that we did not have a new future in which we have no pre@@ sidents , while it was already cap@@ ut@@ ated countries and &quot; to other &quot; people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative plans to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to enter here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ credible Blog .
however , here is the focus of T@@ LS not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is a try to obtain the language variety of major cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land is in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
mass mortality of the world may be avoided , if we do cities , accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often this is linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of listening to feel to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers exhibit their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the audi@@ ts can be adjusted on it .
they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the stories of nar@@ rative of the stories .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara rel@@ ates the b@@ abel from H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the meaning of his F@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ els he divi@@ des his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were very near me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can arrange with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own story stories .
Puerto Rico calls for public debt relief from the United States
with the aim of a new survey of public debt in Puerto Rico , participating in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at pu@@ er@@ anian Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group of &quot; Fren@@ a@@ Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ al@@ ment of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ic Church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ cess@@ ation of the debt reduction of the debt has also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies that are responsible for debts to their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding to the economy in favor of the economy .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension@@ ers .
we require immediate action .
the island - not integrated in the state of state of the United States - is suffering under a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing State view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside will be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizen , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he performed for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that will be alig@@ ned in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the Book of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ test@@ ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year , and licensed here , contains a number of views that employ to deal with free culture on the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements to be built for free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Volun@@ te@@ ers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted in the Ad@@ ra prison directory , which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what did we give up in this process of extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; drawn carriage of the military court from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who set themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and set them from an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remain unknown , but still unknown .
a pioneer of creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in which access to Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes was fore@@ seen as the work that he started around in 2005 with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civilians and mer@@ ging gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ous traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ ve into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able to the public and for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ al@@ u@@ able .
trag@@ ically Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and he taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read English good , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught others , to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opens me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught others , as they were able to use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having stopped in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book a year .
she prepared the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arab into English .
the book is licensed free .

the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is a passage from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens with every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that any of the dangers are no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , arm@@ chairs and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I will sing in every detail of your voice and words ?
I wear passion for me ,
when your eyes say Le@@ be@@ probably
and I will leave another piece of my soul in you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I testify to myself , that I will return soon ...

Mozambique : due to corruption , head of corruption was returned to previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption incident at which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus by which corruption was committed to corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company , which was then on 19 April .
in accordance with a position of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic that granted the application , there would not be an obst@@ acle to the Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old position , as the company was not completed in custody after his sentence .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to set the Director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have in@@ corporate a disciplines against the contra@@ ventions .
however , the company failed , however , and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which has served half .
he could hold paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and send his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has con@@ s@@ ented to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
resi@@ sting !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ cans and student of political science in Brazil says the director no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone has rewarded him in such a way that the state has been so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing mor@@ ality to serve and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served themselves by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand it became a in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was invited and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers it to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a thief belongs to jail :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora of Mach@@ el in prison , but not only as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , lon@@ ging and - next to the proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious human being able to be able , also the father@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn from its ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the network because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though over the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to people in East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective . &quot;
Facebook is cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; You &quot; ( in bur@@ ial scrip@@ ture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely ab@@ norm@@ ative con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort , hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself is not calling us hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that too , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or doubts that they were expressed in the use of his use .
in addition there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ ind@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , if she had kissed his back pain , he made a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech against radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must be , before all posts extingu@@ ishing to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filter the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ ul@@ ook .
what to do instead , is carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sp@@ ind@@ b@@ sen ) .
the good is that this three @-@ day nation@@ alists , dis@@ semin@@ ating hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise her nation@@ alism .
while the promotion has a powerful signal to all , hate speech , it doesn &apos;t like to keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of perc@@ ussions are often a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , with the users to use social networks , a new word or alternative typ@@ ew@@ rit@@ es of cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his friend when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden to submit posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post of &quot; the Facebook community standards did not say . &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asked advice :
Facebook likes to have a soo@@ thing intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words to cen@@ time will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started using this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry &quot; .
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not temp@@ ting the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted Po@@ sts .
if they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks auto c@@ ens@@ orship has su@@ cked for a lot of mo@@ ckery .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ ar language to see if their podium are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language , but nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ical text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see peas cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , have used social networks in order to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in particular in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages , critic@@ ised into his bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of shaving the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better look at the context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end of the children &apos;s ehe
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to ban a law that is intended to offer this practice , so the resi@@ li@@ ent age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members were drawn du@@ ist and Muslim religious communities in the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group who had representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state , as that , not the maturity of the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN Child law , the min@@ ors than , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Chancell@@ ery of the country confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before they should be condemned to take care of their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition sought tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime there came doubts whether the opposition would agree to the law of the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s condition - despite 4 channels ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent who contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where he would already make a simple majority to make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators there was a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s condition was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
after having decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users was thrilled , because the laws have been finally changed to the child &apos;s before .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede used to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago is worth every price .
while Abel was Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to get the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the full age in Trinidad and Tobago is now ir@@ respective of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft for the change of the marriage ceremony was today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members , who were against , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s before is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ fish .
many thanks to all activists who have sm@@ ashed him out .
congratulations .
thanks to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be approved , and he seems to dissolve his promise now .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it was quite right when Mahar@@ aj was going to act against the law , most social media users wished to go differently to the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , is that the state , our daughters , protects against them that they might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ sponsored men that are against them in the advantage , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ d@@ ations or continue the norm , even though there are laws which they have to say .

through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Act on 18 January 2012 .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has closed the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day , more clearly how important the platform for users is to find hel@@ pless and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the lock .
although many techniques were used for blocked web users ( a current article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in an published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University were held , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted since 2007 .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform based on all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator ) , which is based on the system of domain name and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is dis@@ able despite the legal ban .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post reports IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to complete snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org website .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent semen .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cum pe@@ .org , an open source project of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ sten similar mirrors , when in the respective country Wikipedia is produced .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , an Mir@@ ror .
you can access a different URL , which is not the original . that which one sees is of Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ alese wildlife photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature protection
an addic@@ ted rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad exposure and balanced colors .
the motivated him to wear a camera for himself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als can ende@@ av@@ our to get to the international stage .
and his home next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos depicting the attention of Nep@@ als .
he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it better give for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested me at home , when I was interested in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to achieve cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood at faces from face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b yourself from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also , because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king &apos;s King appeared . he moves away immediately , we &apos;ll see you and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to its photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

after the wedding , Indian women for the first time to pron@@ oun@@ cing the name of their husbands

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women deal with greatest care to address the names of their husbands or even from older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns , or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should pay attention to the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a through a criminal court and spur@@ ned by her family and the village community after she had responded a secretly called relatives .
the tradition of their wives also not name by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less conc@@ essions to fear when at all , they should not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health subjects and house@@ wives , were therefore quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the hos@@ tile of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the disman@@ t@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as child@@ r@@ ens up to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages this clubs .
it reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women , and they have made it at the same time as ambassador of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion group did not show women who don &apos;t call their husbands at the name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which the women can easily identi@@ fiable .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of their husbands , there is a bre@@ ach not guilty of all rights and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this , is considered the post@@ age , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never done ourselves up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini who had never known her husband so far as the name of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long , after the video was at the end .
practice , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him at his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were being protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini displayed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women attempted to bring discussion with a practice in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , means they do not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which women married the names of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that during all the exercise , she only decided to leave her , and another decided to leave all the fru@@ stration against him and his family , by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in ad@@ renal@@ ine , they decided to have broken with an ancient bre@@ ach , the women decided that they would actually try to call her husbands at home .
and they held their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a wide variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law firm she was afraid , she was afraid , and said that it was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation held in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard him to carry him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women did not complete it , but my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now in a better position to choose even to bear him in some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making a trip at each discussion group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; she d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have played over some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our husbands , never said so hon@@ estly .
it feels great to tell certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only known Sar@@ is since their marriage .
most of them is okay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ v@@ ein spa , a wide shirt of a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed themselves .
after much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own country code , the mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ rough Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women may wear them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it .
to the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion lu@@ b has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving into rolls :
we have made only small steps to date .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( The Beatles Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans were out of memories and their appreciation for the Beatles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beatles visit in 1966 in Japan is considered the turn of the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to rotate the Japanese .
people quite quickly became clear that they had no other choice than the Beatles received with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail trade seven &amp; amp ; i hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! I today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan . they were here 51 years ago , they were in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in the English lessons of Japanese mid@@ schools .
the Beatles of the Beatles survived everything .
today is The Beatles Memorial Day .
we all love in our house The Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should be present or not .
and as for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
once you love the Beatles , these are your 5 places you necessarily have to visit you .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sc@@ atter enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beatles Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course some of the companies also use the fan base community service , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese nood@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! it today is The Beatles Memorial Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to me today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am eating R@@ amen nood@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day is lost today .
so , we hope you are there !

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trade , probably for super@@ sti@@ cal purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called now a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims were be@@ headed and some of the organs were extracted .
two men were arrested and in the after@@ math they stood that the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it is giving local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a gl@@ amor@@ ous man &apos;s head can bring gold @-@ old or wealth , the Poli@@ ze@@ al@@ cher of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ amor@@ ous men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , aiming for ob@@ sc@@ ure &apos;s purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN had passed a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the Blo@@ g@@ gers &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the major social difficulty in which Mozambique is faced :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably made it recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o suffered attention in international community attention after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ ute of stat@@ ute ) after having participated in the draft of Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he considers it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to gain calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Liu X@@ ia , release him for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ red on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a person who refused to comment whether the United Nations should practice pressure to allow Liu in Foreign abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway , when the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately won &apos;t do anything with the decision .
diplomatic relations resum@@ ed only in December last year . Norway signed an agreement to meet the salmon pipes to China , as exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release , and invited Liu to take his price in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to counter@@ act its price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision to free Liu and his wife immediately freed from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
China &apos;s top diplomatic mission , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as she ha@@ sted in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet all visits and receive , they wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in which it is possible to help him with his genius . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 , announced that the embassy would not only leave Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia free of her house arrest .
the invitation of the US embassy was in@@ fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country I have the right to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ verb@@ al and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel bud@@ get@@ ary and access to medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to imp@@ ose Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical assistance that he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could be overs@@ ha@@ iling Liu &apos;s visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to give Liu a reasonable medical care to provide and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
Canada demands China to commit his international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , true and responsible for exercising this rights blocked .
France
French Foreign Affairs called for China in a statement on June 29 to release Liu for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives any treatments that he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family have to contact him .
although the news channel France Info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the mainland in Taiwan required China on June 27 , to adopt Liu release and claim a bigger tolerance towards those who require peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ islat@@ ure Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu is also invited to allow China to treat the ill intellectu@@ als to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in an explanation on 28 June by Liu very concerned and gave to pray that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that he took and for whom he was strictly pun@@ ish , to a harmon@@ ious , stabil@@ ising and weal@@ thy China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has caused a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Bar Association in New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people have to commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing auth@@ orization of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , one can say that we were not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory viol@@ ating .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ isy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he appeared un@@ avoid@@ able .
in contrast , it defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York ; equally cities that are led permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old cor@@ er of the author@@ itarian fe@@ eder appears to be the pre @-@ giving demo@@ cr@@ ats , abandoned logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end of the final week , the answers given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to its American guests to our press , our predic@@ tive , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ ried more relevant questions with non @-@ answer rational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , his opinion when she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by rele@@ asing his comment on the blog , he points to the reviews that you should start to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ easy , even if we look forward to free and righteous elections .
he justified Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is a leader of a growing generation , making such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the minister of Justice of Singapore said very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of old Gar@@ de , what I expected - was I understood with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes , right and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review marks the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ ente :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was committed to a mistake , or was it a fre@@ ud@@ inal speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will be viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government choir , statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why are the people of Singapur of their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in addition , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the Year , Singapore is and was always a town :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singapur of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country mainly , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true .
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .

global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ leading aspect of your residence or homeland ?
their answers are being published here as part of a ongoing series , revealed by rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ ets should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that will be put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation takes place , it is considered polite , interest in his talk partner by presenting personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication , the default answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice hockey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook inside of anger , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know it , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible at her ruck@@ sack when they are travelling .
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
American by contrast ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the toler@@ ant country .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t make me anything if you would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly , as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called to be sp@@ ic@@ uous - like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically , un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
harmless to be harmless and un@@ interesting , and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote off the things that pass around one around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even be going to say that the desire to be free and alone , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Canadi@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ dated as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence along with the neighbours .
our warm @-@ hear@@ ted , open kindness , I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au considered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
musical video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video which took the jun@@ ta in 2014 and restore power in 2014 , despite its promises to restore civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend &apos;s prec@@ ep@@ ts .
although not expressly politically , music video is indirectly related to the per@@ sist@@ ently military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
only within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook has received 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dictator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists stri@@ pped the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies as it beha@@ ves in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta reign .
have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have been tra@@ pped in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , given to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision @-@ making of important national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; installation change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ age and in@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrested activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of having assass@@ inated the monarchy , was pro@@ secuted .
Thailand sets a strict singing against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase their decision to buy sub@@ ordin@@ ate U @-@ boats , although security experts they war@@ n that the purchase is need@@ less and a waste of tax loss .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery vans , before they bring them into an inter@@ sec@@ ration camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; to society in society and uses Internet users for long term pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the band members of the band , which was im@@ itated the let@@ tering of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; already used by put@@ ties during protests in 2014 .

villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal tanks of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Abis@@ asi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also known in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia as well as Gei@@ ster@@ suburbs .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these vul@@ tures .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; everything is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , symbo@@ lically represent the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls to him hard to end this .
&quot; everything is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there is only a paved road with infl@@ atable glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , meanwhile deser@@ ted the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , who still have one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her friend and suddenly leave it in the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the retail industry ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her eldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Central Asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you neither have a sweet garden or a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holiday are , we will visit us .
but we cannot do that constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls her to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could install zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they re@@ members the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central America , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ ia was simply gone ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but this will take something , &quot; explains them .
Nat@@ ascha is available for every child about $ 9 children &apos;s money .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was once there , they hold pigs , cows , paraly@@ ne and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have a fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any job and all lived like it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our talk to the end , a little boy desc@@ ended on us .
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , then rolling the hill .
a group of children is now writing the ball .
while running , some of them cast stones on the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for uncertainty in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ ck was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ ru@@ sive pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden earrings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ular form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - despite hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people to call people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; mom@@ my Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez had already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them to the hospital , when she is sick , she buys them medicines that cannot pay them , they massive them with a bal@@ m that had exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if mom is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a son of yoghurt ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other directions from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that Afri@@ cans speak on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his way@@ companion Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mom Africa is our Mother and we never let it go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests send their often text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who are travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ en@@ g@@ asse to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in her small house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the airline tickets will be sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was dismissed by a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press the money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ stone , offered him its roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears , trav@@ ellers consult the trav@@ eler quietly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ daughter she we@@ bs her album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , boy and elderly .
she laughs at sad , while she briefly imag@@ ined her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification where they refers to the district government , to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleansing &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities refused to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , breaking news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the release of the police , the app that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , by online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make user atten@@ tively , how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these features can be used naturally in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers could use the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ c@@ ements about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote countries like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ y Internet .
on Twitter based media ou@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( a lot of charge ) , the cen@@ sored news in China showed photos of a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen were disp@@ osed of the residents of the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they comp@@ elled people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by accident technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( To @-@ rise ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus ensures un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities , and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is apparently any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of different possible verses , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane tells his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and set up that you &apos;re alone in a place where all Import@@ ant disappeared .
everything has changed and dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth revealed , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one that has hit itself into a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you pick up the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and actors , the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is tra@@ cked on the axis of ignor@@ ance . it is clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father thri@@ ce in three times , but that was not enough to say &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security services rendered it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he put his power over us by evidence of destroying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful prot@@ esting such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to allow the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all neighbour@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , in@@ sist@@ ently , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a city , which is in@@ gest@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night , things were calm down , after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped .
I broke the silence when I cried out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house@@ keeper .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we were amazed to a splendid picture that filled my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment you realize that you are liberated the spirit from the light , but it &apos;s not interested in the ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make sure we meet at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have made it the way to the office of the Security Service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father already was there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; or you are just brave enough to shout , if we are not near . &quot;
his eye @-@ filled eyes were set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you look for what to look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I replied : &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to look to you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father would like to do with it . &quot;
the gest@@ ank of this cursed sentence lies with me in the nose today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an ancient torture which I was exposed for months .
I break through the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I wear with myself .
afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I appreciate all details exactly before I use the room .
unlike otherwise , they have shared a larger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoners and can put me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked on an established communication method : with the fist to beat the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; fl@@ acci@@ dentally . &quot;
after long hes@@ it@@ tering he answered me .
apparently it was found in any of the surrounding cells an experienced man @-@ aged age , which is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness no markings are recogni@@ zable in me , and physicians does not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was placed in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ators had insured me , they would be free when I stay .
li@@ ars .
gladly , I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled to fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black paint the color of the destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret to protect the state security of us to protect and prevent the terrorists in ourselves , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational map and ver@@ ted the close view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ance to turn the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a mighty hero .
I take care of the audi@@ ble and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and st@@ ony man ; at least he comes to me so before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin with your life as you can join this Ta@@ ge@@ al and see demonstrations , which will soon become an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer me , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t tell you exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes , after a friendly conversation , has become an ordinary communication agent .
when and how it happened was in@@ significant .
some voice in me said that I was sick or bad , to be punished , although I had done nothing to earn these punishment .
in Pun@@ ishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates back to the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker will take care of your scre@@ am .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you can &apos;t hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , so that it turned out the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present us out , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ s .
within one hour , three of them rarely changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , whence I heard it cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling and found no pleasure doing so , why he was next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity per@@ sever@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two horri@@ ble hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning is fulfilled the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young people : &quot; my lord , my father has to be fear@@ ful worried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet , and go away , you are moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always free .
where do they lead me ? !

H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war areas , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee &apos;s second generation - so he was born himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he is dissolved in water , Nes@@ ad@@ an . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ tim@@ ely called Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speak the loops of tep@@ id coffee and the hose of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of State Jord@@ anians have cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections , supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the country &apos;s homosex@@ ual Fron@@ ti@@ ers , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman on the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been canc@@ eled &quot; because of sexual orientation .
many say , the commitment to the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Free Speech in the Arab world be dangerous activ@@ ism , responsible for the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , who continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sil@@ ently rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional gender nor@@ ms to be born by his vision of the fate of Arab women who made vo@@ y@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently known unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they should trust .
over the past few years , in Jordan the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ de &apos; has increased - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ our of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women , victims , attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for frag@@ ile control from the year 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of internal family violence , &quot; and for their release often is a lon@@ gl@@ asting bureaucra@@ tic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family , that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , also not to re@@ lie@@ ve the issues surrounding the country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , a fact that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it ass@@ ump@@ tions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me became a sin@@ king , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question about the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focus on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everybody else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want &quot; - be faith or not , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ age ro@@ ya in order to note that his comments were torn off the context , and his opinion has been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a working version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is wonder@@ ing : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later was to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anians do it not ?
the real problem so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government is sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service accepted several former government officials and members of the teaching industry , with the grounds that they would have expressed themselves on comm@@ ent@@ ations in social media , which inter@@ ned with the deeply ro@@ oted corruption in the country .
in view of what is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of Jord@@ anians .
for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila is going to take action for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , de@@ pressing and internal changes . it is certain that this changes from day to day will take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to do &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions and artificial type of democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to continue to resist resistance .
this report was presented by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is part of the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
those big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a version of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the Fest@@ wagen , the drums , and dancing over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en since a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only true truth - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre high @-@ car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appar@@ ition and body care were so important as in this history , because they are helping to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dressing .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for Aes@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports enthusiasts such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to attract more norm@@ ality into the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing which can make this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show who can create the cent@@ ris@@ ky le@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitors are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who finds himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to communicate her weapons against hair tools , and instead of bad advice to get a training in the hairdres@@ ser art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the variety of opportunities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession , currently in fashion .
before the school year , the school offered special training workshops in March and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have constructed this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ an@@ ism &quot; guer@@ ri@@ llas &quot; guer@@ ri@@ llas , published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who are cast out to teach aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer out of the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , which encourage young people to write a letter of guer@@ ri@@ llas .
only recently , her country was the site of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after a long negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC movement ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered significant as the signat@@ ory of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , before Colombia , there is still a long way to reach from a real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ties , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock carrying their weapons in themselves , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company , again , who had used to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ lla struggles , must record these in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young colum@@ nist will join together and in the integration process would have to help .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messenger to former guer@@ ri@@ llas , to welcome them again in society .
the campaign &apos;s goal are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ llas - who should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk short with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need them much needed .
he plane , he told it further to share his love with people who needed the urgent action in this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in one of the United Nations camps .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ ia traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC beha@@ ved as they had done before , to counter the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of under@@ taking people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighters led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage where the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ llas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate , a fatal weapon in the thorn @-@ ber@@ nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly answered the tears about the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him completely , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would give me a mistake .
but now I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grew up and the F@@ ARC had already been in secret .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC proclaimed the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to make society more just in this country .
for a target of this mag@@ nit@@ ude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manu@@ ela was impressed by :
to hear these people , who had never heard hearing and had no voting rights , and to know that people who often have been seen as Monster and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned through their lifestyle and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the land lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm have done to us , and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ nist has been made aware that peace would reign after the dis@@ armament of peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to lift up and protest for their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution , and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as foundation of existence , many difficulties are coming up .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and que@@ ens live in Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and com@@ press@@ ors .
in terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months of the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that such as a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic .
LGB@@ T@@ Q &apos;s legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international headlines before several months after reports were published that the tra@@ pping , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took the susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced by the gender equality of her Land@@ s@@ woman , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
for fear of her life she brought her last end to the United States .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round about a matter of What@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was right there , a few grocery bags from the back of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : how long will you honor the family still , you swal@@ low ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up the last end of the hospital in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get along and started to scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital , I learned that I had two counts on my right pul@@ mon@@ ary organ .
OC Media : in which nursing wings were you laid - in whom men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has gone resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove to prove that everything was a lie .
they created absurd demands : some said me , I have to prove it out by the streets ; others wanted me to go up in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only evil and Photos@@ hop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some older people said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the whole republic is damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened window discs and a license plate with a 95 .
after the third time happened , it became clear that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to offer their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still cannot realize how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without record without me , without ID card , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
arrived and checked into a hotel .
the number was registered at a foreig@@ ner .
I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe in security , just because you have forsaken the country ?
our people already know what hotel you use . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is a table theme .
some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ual elements I still bear in myself .
so much I wish I could not overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with a camera , I really give me effort to look like the person out of their past - so in my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , no man was arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person , and at the end , a evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC media : are men still held in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine , there was just not many .
if , especially those who have not submit their relatives or were left by their relatives , to place Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so you can present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are consumed , they will show their bodies in television , claiming they would have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this only a assumption , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just got someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was growing .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were involved .
until now they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , there was no reports yet . however , we assume that such actions are possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave off ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny in 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but at the end of time he was thrown back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were stu@@ ffed up ; I had coloured eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sch@@ aria has never made me a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and all the city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a gu@@ ile : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when people make good fun .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you because they believed they are ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this mercy endu@@ red ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about mor@@ als on television .
he didn &apos;t talk about us per se , but above the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city started to change .
he who had b@@ lown before and laugh@@ ed at once , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , acting , I run it to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I do not spend long cents .
I discovered these people myself , when I ab@@ rupt it .
I am Muslim and wants to help you need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth , that there is no spon@@ ges with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er also who , the Russians also have those ; on the whole planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , live together with men .
do you know many think about transi@@ tions of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sty .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body .
not , whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all . I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ds within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ mad community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ atorium .

the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , which may benefit the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ mad Human Rights groups that remain in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube , the moments after he had been ign@@ ited .
some people were able to extingu@@ ish the flames back , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the combustion were so strong that doctors could not do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab ancest@@ ral minority , and activists warned that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ mad Centre for Human Rights announced that this month , some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of fighting their families and to pursue safe work .
Arab Ah@@ mad suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of the Arab @-@ Nazi community living in Iran was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to consoli@@ date their living .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and took power in 1925 , making ethnic autonomy for all Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most influential and most precious agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and empt@@ ying .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the ancest@@ ral regime in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of tri@@ bal , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate below the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian youth now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are seeking a work that completed primary school , 55 % has completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ ant among the young Ah@@ mad men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse , the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in setting process :
since Fun@@ c@@ tion@@ aries and institutions are pre@@ fers to set the Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi will have access to work@@ options in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or , because even the Arab names will not be toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speech of the Arab language or the tra@@ ms of Arab clothes are not toler@@ ated .
faced with the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi must bear , human rights activists beat alert , before the situation is explosive .
it remains waiting , whether the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identified with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is an revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ ri@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought about scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why should we generally be all Fem@@ inist * .
for example , women still deserve less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to what they may do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak to what kind of physical , physical and verb@@ al have been ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
but are they all in that women - all women - they should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institutional form of racial forms , which we are exposed to black women .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and origin of origin less deserve white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to black sp@@ ears and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds to suffer higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women , all men and all those who have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not take myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman , who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which refer to gender as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sp@@ ear , which always has rejected me and countless other black women and again rejected .
in her speech , So@@ jour@@ ner mour@@ ned 1851 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and also I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature .
I refuse to join me fac@@ tions , which also absorb our customs clearance and customs , in order to push their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to get white women the importance of over@@ l@@ eness of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to give them better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women a home in various forms and bor@@ rowed from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of me full and completely by femin@@ ism , and called me the movement of Wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than to use me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women in our own ideas and give us into the Sp@@ ines that will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana v@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they can defend ourselves on our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which account for the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call , after they read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I have existed .
I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment , in which my life is neither exagger@@ ated , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing versus contamination : mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
over the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in the can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution to his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we lost as I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ shed Alliance - which is aimed at protecting and protect the rivers , bro@@ o@@ ks and rivers in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the drums and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq @-@ based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist , filmed and published .
the focus of their work lies on the followed , little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using co@@ oper@@ ative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help sub@@ pressed municipalities that can tell their stories in their way .
women and their more difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Mu@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter @-@ free ) , which reports over the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to the protection of the affected people .
a police commission@@ er said As@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partner who had become violent over violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said , their statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse of abuse , there is also a useful display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later the second wife moved their ad .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make any display at all , they generally receive no support from the State .
in many cases , women also are finan@@ cially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all the prosecution authorities .
content 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ c 2 Un@@ visible abuse and a legal system , which does not under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Can@@ ays laws : good approach , f@@ law@@ ed realization and st@@ ats
it is difficult to determine how many women really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various specifications and reports that show not even ans@@ at@@ to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the Office of the Public At@@ tor@@ ney General ( 9@@ 600 ads ) went to violence against women for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , violence against women went .
86 % of ads during the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace @-@ judicial authorities . 86 % of the ads added here .
in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women said they were physically treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women will not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no own crime , the prosecution authorities cannot be documented , as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists told at least 12 cases of female places in the country .
the co @-@ ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died because of violence through men .

invisible mis@@ use and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t want to do this , but then , however . this should always regret it for ever .
today , Mariana has 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she wore the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time that recogni@@ zable :
I never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women had happened to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are dec@@ eit@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that it would never happen .
Mariana took advantage of social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he isolated them .
many people answered them , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ oric , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why she had fallen so long of Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victim of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mis@@ led them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
their weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Victori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed to an un@@ mistak@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and their homeland , where it was mainly around money , power and the influence of their former partner .
limitations laws : good approach , lacking implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applicable .
the display of ab@@ uses is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen of Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Für@@ She ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ In@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law sees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and pun@@ ishing harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the leg@@ islat@@ ure has changed in some points to also win the M@@ EPs for the Law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the original bill was intended to apply the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) , which must present the victims of violence even if they simply want to preserve and receive a safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law cannot be effective , if the leg@@ islat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here , a re@@ think must take place , so violence is no longer considered a little ro@@ wer .
those who are silent in view of these facts is guilty and contribute to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we must refund so long , until abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . among other things , parts of the law were canc@@ eled , among other things a passage , who called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed because of a decision of the source of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year , the om@@ an authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to prison in prison where he served a year@@ ling sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and ordered before the court , but later returned .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 , after he had appointed his father , said i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a ruler .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important lands in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ t@@ ans rule is marked by the hard efforts of security forces , in particular the state secret service , public freedom , including press freedom , freedom of freedom and human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the government guarantees peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , and activists , activists , and their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , has been published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties in the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . in this case , corruption was forced for corruption and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a verdict in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties loose hands of judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the Committee , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS , Deputy Chief Editor , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s capture as Chief Editor .
the newspaper was closed on in@@ definite period after the Information Minister had given the order that &quot; release and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ uria , the first negoti@@ ation in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was held .
the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison sentence and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both among other things inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ gra@@ ding of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found in addition to the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year @-@ old pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , an annual prohibition of employment was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having &quot; an information network to spread material which might pose a risk for public order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a security deposit was established at the amount of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 December 2016 , the Appe@@ als Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 , however , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after prohi@@ biting his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the om@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister announced an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and , with which the Minister ordered another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has recently been injured in Oman at the latest time .
for further injuries include the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will immediately release and un@@ conditional ;
2 . to create a safe environment for Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go on their job ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . in any circumstances that human rights violations and journalists in Oman imp@@ acted its righ@@ t@@ ful human rights , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ating measures , including judicial ver@@ ik@@ y .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with its agreement
medical research in Africa is not rare or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons for lack of medical health and vaccines , which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries in Africa , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists itself , and its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ba health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Var@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I supported the sam@@ ba national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ V : what are your opinion about important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only rely solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise , we will always remain the recipient to be rather than M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ V : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special research training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from that .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the easy access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that perio@@ dic@@ ally make articles accessible only to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been ch@@ ill out in the United States since the 1980s .
his company provides 114 varieties such as outlet , the first plant grown by NASA astr@@ onau@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
almost 20 years of work , Mort@@ on was placed only by his own accident and the question how many sal@@ ts can he get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more salads were patented , and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents are not only for single varieties but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotary or green or curved leaves .
over the last years , more such patents have been registered on more plants such as grain or cart@@ ot@@ t@@ ens@@ orship . due to this trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still finds let@@ tu@@ ce , however he needs longer , as his work is always more difficult for his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock rock would lie in a river around which I have to p@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far too far .
and if they stand before the court , nobody can breed any more new salad , because all characteristics are patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tries to stimul@@ ate those characteristics which he wants .
however , he is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
astr@@ onau@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; house of the station . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds like that , as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed sound ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can under@@ take that others can freely use them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seed to breed as their own varieties , and it is not immediately available - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark outlook
for the home professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and opportunity to breed new plants , both important for nutrition security than also for environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in larger cl@@ adding such as Bi@@ odi@@ vers@@ ität , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little to breed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and takes care of becoming more frequently more frequently @-@ increasing awareness among farmers in August and September 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to buy locally , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , should also know that the way is bred on farms as such as this vegetables is bred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dietary confi@@ dently without seed @-@ friendly people is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other their seed still freely available . in contrast , their approach is to be patented , in contrast , seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i Supp@@ orters , that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gen@@ pool due to the increasingly abundant spiritual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited , dis@@ able shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , the director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ ot@@ ments are protected as intellectual property , which is either not usable for plant breeding or not just a value .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ en@@ rich plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ itors
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such a way through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently more than ever before , as the changed conditions are fore@@ seen by climate change much worse .
in an E @-@ Mail , Monsanto spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ ces and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry , the company set up for conservation of genetic diversity .
it is , however , the view that intellectual property increases other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can follow up as soon as the patent is expired .
often , these instructions help others to come to the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bits innovations , but it promotes the public more materials and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years for waiting , until a patent loop , makes sure no innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is however , that genetic Resources would have been a common good , and there should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers make their job easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on does not bo@@ ther in the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics .
the plants form them up and as bre@@ eders have no idea , how plants do it .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , will also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are believed to grow significantly in their varieties of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving to international markets but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents , there are most smaller seed companies , even without any patents - either to refuse it , or do they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ war@@ ding or both is the case .
the Frank Mort@@ on &apos;s independent plant breeding is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders is innovative by using plant pat@@ ents innovative : &quot; it looks like I have been using my efforts to produce something new , more than companies that patented .
I always need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is only 20 years ahead of competition , making it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to satisfy certain requirements .
it also supports you to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from land to country , because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not just being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows the patents in a far@@ med plants .
however , a statement is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring to the patent office to implement these new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards sponsor@@ ship of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems that is currently a global alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems that should be scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies , such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . in this case , it represents the view that farmers should have the opportunity to enhance and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food security can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a variety , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a link between Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is particularly respected , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played any role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still unlock content in the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government closed the website of the World Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about sel@@ fish .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
the World Network for Human Rights Information Party - despite this attack and violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities , so it was never so important to pursue this goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the sperm and not re@@ im@@ itate us . we hope to continue our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of we@@ bin@@ ations to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I also there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Studies Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , whom he was set to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of also native to Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while taking over the student protests and took a video how the police practic@@ ed physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly round about politics and the rights of human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the lock of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , a attempted murder , fore@@ charge at the National Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other web site , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t wrote in vain . in other words : my words have influence , though only a little audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a Archive for me .
first , I used it to the item of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ ters go the way up to an end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this is technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12th of June , we saw how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block up content and filter to filter access to the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally emb@@ ell@@ ished , so that the pen@@ al decisions can be hit behind closed doors , which allows the Egyptian population to act as a rule against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second biggest city of the country and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 year old was shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ den second day is assass@@ inated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers from the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a well @-@ called financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports , such as these are daily , and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
thus , the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16th the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; which they announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything that however only happened in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes said that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war rate , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then asks questions to conce@@ al .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners .
does the name &quot; war &quot; harm more than they benefit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued over a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to make responsibility for the police force .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra at the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with non @-@ sufficient investment in personnel , education , and historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent town in Brazil is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no such cities is located in the Rio de Janeiro state .
when we watch the murder rates per state , Rio is located at number 16 , &quot; she writes .

on this safety policy measures the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , formed a police unit whose goal is to capture a massive police force and stationed a unity permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . since a few years the U@@ PP had to protect the U@@ PP but after several reports on poor communities and repression against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio cannot represent - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to implement means and ways that are typical for war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is a civilian point in the countryside , and to the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spher@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians , to plant mushrooms

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian towns suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Nobel Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly heavily affected , where an attack with chemical weapons demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these were under siege under siege under siege under siege , which resulted in that people rely on locally produced or by tunnel and control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , traditional food products such as flesh have become un@@ reach@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a counter@@ balance , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food is , however , to an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; we decided for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and put his relief that it is now going to gain more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

because of the fuel short@@ age , locally manufactured fuel used for plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they started using the &quot; production of from the regions &quot; fung@@ us &quot; before they checked their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption .

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that ra@@ ined in the North of Portugal in the week .
two and forty persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government was proclaimed last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire @-@ break@@ downs , which spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , in 2017 in Portugal alone , about 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
quite Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017

the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures .
the people asked why the civilian protection was not able to con@@ strain the extent of tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al declared by the federal government of Portugal the P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co Zeitung comments :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão were streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads made by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in oil liabilities with a high risk of risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the whale @-@ form , which brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ ated by the municipalities which saw the new rules as a barrier for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity concerning means of self @-@ protection , that was an open rear door , so that everything was built , &quot; introduces João Sor@@ val in the same article by the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it attentive to spread large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this species always spread wide .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal will arrive on October 15th and 16th , when residents sought information or attempted to contact members who was offline .
it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : you took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October so that the servers followed the amount of 400,000 users that followed the fires that followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years ago , a terrible war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings were broken out who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a nation of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family dinner together .
even if his mother said it back then , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the dawn , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him into the tow@@ ing .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Communist Party of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt uns@@ atis@@ factory .
the Taliban was still closer to the Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af took refuge in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ leg@@ ru@@ ster . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left from his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar which were heavier than he himself to make his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
back then , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was min@@ ted by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we suspended n@@ ylon before the open window , so that we don &apos;t give night at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed twice a day food in needy .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness rates a kind of second chance for exp@@ iring asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that find asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation of the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special treatment centres . &quot; it is impro@@ vised by improvis@@ ing facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an admission centre , if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can withdraw from the asylum application for months after regi@@ stering the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for a accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ fortun@@ ate living life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af cont@@ ested its entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ el@@ lim@@ bis@@ s .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucra@@ cy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan operated companies , including dres@@ sm@@ eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are largely refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the story of their journey to Italy .
Afgh@@ anische entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also has Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims however far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail , and aim to return to the country , which he had to leave had been forced to leave teenagers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my land , and I can &apos;t live happy when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ vatives . &quot; so they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan as well .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill , which predic@@ ts that users can only use social media like Twitter or Facebook after registration at a government authority .
users would have to use the social media to use social networks , within six months after the successful leg@@ islat@@ ure at the website of the authority , as well as their ID number .
whoever missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the final inspection of a criminal payment .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently under legislative as well as the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee , and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Congress granted a legislative proposal to be introduced to the har@@ dening of the president or high officials .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President as well as State institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the bill , such action would indeed be en@@ acted with prison and fin@@ es , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would represent a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud &apos;s Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) of the 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had demonstrated against the military put@@ sch of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , it was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May as the prison direction , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are single , head@@ set of other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .

in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan expressly provides a controversial law bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime backed by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption acc@@ use official amnesty .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ al plans should look for the support of the leg@@ islat@@ ure .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the designation of his sources given by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press department , which journalists protects the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the Tunis District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China force social media to submit their identity card ?
according to new rules of information offices in the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media will need a permit before they write messages in social media or share .
in addition , it is indicated that registration will be required with the full re@@ viewer name .
analysts suspect that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks shall be reached . it is un@@ clear until now , as the authorities will use these provisions .
Chinese network citizens proposed in social media to protect these regulations only to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
