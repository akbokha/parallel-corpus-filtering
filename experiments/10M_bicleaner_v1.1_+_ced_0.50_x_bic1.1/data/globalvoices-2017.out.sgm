<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors read and operated by American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such an excellent impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-student who was the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to method Man, "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you are always who you are and it's easy Acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is moving with its bottlenticity.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of his former colleague, declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his testimony and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won the Republican presidential election, was the highest number ever reached by the party of nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and electors not with people in line, which I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic programme, the people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not agree with the "Cincinnati Inquirer" by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced during Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace, and my colleagues helped to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much of my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied values deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either convicted to oversee their racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as a rampant.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who take action on a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them are, for Trump agreed, because they want to recover control over a country that they disappoint?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (m.).: as much as "rebellion of the White against all other ethnicities"; wording from white in Anplay to the White and Whiplash, what the great Van Jones called, exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always, America means everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as his president, elected twice the son of an Kenyaner, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: to hell with versatility, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he spoke on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" we roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who isn't like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loudly "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both locations, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; a old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now La Banda de Música (musical music) plays in the municipality: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has an opportunity to overcome their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs misuse and Banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But that after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project, and the youth had such a rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shining eyes and play in the gubel you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbreke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically up at the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital of capital - on instruments which are made of reproduced waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments which consist of local fixed waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling plant under Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imids violins, violate, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez recalls a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura to start the first time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place, in which the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown somewhat, which he never seen before: a waste made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and calls itself The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landscapes Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest, like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landscapes Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of garbage music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra also played his music from Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically reported international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices to common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, then it was known that this ship had already been running illegal fishing in Liberia before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries have risen accordingly and little inclined, a legislative complaint to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles, quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries, which you simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team who discovered the ship during the time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then sold out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">At the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, crosses the criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">Alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the Premier were driven out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "so we have eight countries that are equal and working together. you can exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing" "", "Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to expire. illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm the delicially equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between different countries, the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">Here, the individual countries can exchange, for example, exchange licenses, news for suspicious activity or details, which have noticed or experienced during a harbour area.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea, through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to know the ships that fishing in banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such that indicate that a ship will make his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish license, where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch, can be found on the basis of such ships in their harbours. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that even the numbers could not be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to achieve, "" says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Berber company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to gain estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the illegal fisherman who penetrate the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats, absent for the region's commercial fishing catch. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Regarding their practices and actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of imagined species and fishing protected in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-stocky control system" "", "Long." "" "before, a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say" You mustn't run my port. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal conclusion is trying to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks distributed to spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it fleeing and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight against crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to get suspicious ships more precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps to push the illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also provides technical support with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information carriers. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that can be displayed satellite data and can be displayed in every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to get rid of the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - that makes simply sense" "", "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundling their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at the global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on ships with a global system." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have been confusing without license and have hardly expected to have consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i involved a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board towing nets, whose deployment is banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries have also noticed these successes. "the effect is so strong that we have now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." we are an educational subject. "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear per year by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined together to meet the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they fight against the same model as FISH-i. "with safety, the goal is to allow more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph in Somalia: in October there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under a false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to run towed nets.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking a strong sign for Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working in the entire cosmos.

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time, he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bit wrapped in a ceiling and told me to carry it into the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he looked at an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a couch, tortured on human beings.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to an end of a cable. the other end has been fastened by the body of the person who was right there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They captivated a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrew him with water and hunted him a cargo of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed "</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were spotted with handcuffs and carried the eye to the eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian which was also indicted in the process) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down on the face - all were in hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra there were some rooms that were called offices.</seg>

<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphremism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible stuffed things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear that war yield a bayonet or maybe military junctions, which one assumes a enemy that is fighting.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then it is not a war yield, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in this Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime, and I answered: and thou shouldest lift the cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded against anger, stroke me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you walk so far, then I will find you and kill you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a pity for this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to say.</seg>

<seg id="296">Why do children escape?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with her own mother, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have just been able to bring them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why do their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families where they could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearances of the corpse is the last abhous act, which one can do to man.</seg>

<seg id="309">I was even in the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>

<seg id="350">Machining of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was a translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The liberal daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"I feel really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation) for our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese news service J-Cast News focused on the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents, but definitely to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this represents a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the number of seniors 1,803 caused a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of breast cancer. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate for example from the English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be missing understanding of survival, cost-based, or the relatively low number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign employees themselves have to make translations, but then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic recording, which often uses T-shirts or bags, are only used in stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto City now uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users found that they have no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are equally accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasts were also organized by protests in Caracas, organised by oppositionist groups who refute the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is encapsulated, and recommended users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is unaccessible by a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online broadcaster. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local internet providers can sometimes use DNS. it is a technology that promptly answer the DNS servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server answers flawed or denied the request by calling on such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elotoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was discontinued on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who was transmitted live in Caracas during the protests in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on shipment.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates Internet connections, so the Venezolanists will always make access to multimedia coverage on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="419">Shortly before she returned to the university, she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride, and she said. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "said she." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. when Criaditas was called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a great family with little money overlays her least-year-old son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned yet, is that the children will have to pay for countless days of housework, which will never be paid and sacrifices of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you can't lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This is called Criadazgo practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, recherished and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the criadita, guarantees in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">It is, on the other hand, the family, who close their daughter in faith that they may improve their education to improve their position in society and make something of yourself "can give to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes care of the girl with faith and justifies that she would give someone a chance that would not be an apprenticeship, and perhaps even starving.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret places in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguar, her body showed traces of fierce battles. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former military-affiliated Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as an officer at the number of residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira suggested as long as a stick to Marín until she suffered a deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the paraguayan society in the Criadazgo's death for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there were "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which terms boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a generous investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before dish, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - if the first time in history is a case from Criadazgo to court.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as a workforce, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik where her father worked, bankruptcy, and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all working and started to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, they purified the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and desinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished with learning, the more leisure time she had.</seg>

<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would then be set up that it has been commissioned to share social media citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users and user would have to register on the website of the site with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, consists of local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed if it is believed that the design cannot be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to make the registration of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register, that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the stage of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, documented by the northeastern Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those of the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Miyagi prefecture. the Miyagi prefecture was a different prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vanish, because the tsunami had to disappear whole churchyard from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even in addition, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local point of view which progressively met six years later to rebuild the life of the local community.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper incorporates both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses (in the country), which was finished in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, for six years after the disaster, evacuated of containers of capacity were still stricken to resettles in a final spare time, even six years after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful in the year 2011. more than 75 percent of the evacuation produced by the disaster in containers were moved into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 Schools, who were affected by the misfortune, will open its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures were more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed its operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, were dragged.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "" "" "it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands of Fukushima in the" "" "nuclear restricted zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered further, but here, Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist arrivals in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima however, only 75 percent can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population being prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation by. they questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their empower has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey caused that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken action to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough for catastrophes was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the location of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic circumstances which had to be experienced in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been moved to long-lasting spare homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">The most of the evacuation centres are most of the evacuation centres, older than 50 years old. you must compete in proper containers, because efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-Hirn trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Physicians emitted this Saturday and delivered him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of police officers, who attacked with a bail. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the procedure was suspended from active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he performs in Goiânia with his percussion on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer tested by a protesters and end up to the intensive care station, his face would be on television for six months and the whole suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, distributed the video in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by police officers and further sanctions shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from another perspective, is also dipped in social networks.</seg>

<seg id="614">Police transfer</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where there was a brutal police raid against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were set up in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, Gummigrade and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">S & D Euro MP Flavio Serafini, social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain force on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media is tracked out by the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo strives targeted targeted about a broken glass windows to illustrate with a photo their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a built-in bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic foundation, more about a broken windshield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognize if one is strictly protected against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "vandalism" receives a absurd implications of absurd violence, and the typical violence of the military police are given by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Reducts Forced villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso closed nearly hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The ethnic community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a Central - in Spanish concierge - known, regardless of that there is no notable sugar seams on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were cut in the sugar cane mill.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"" "" "" "Nene, a Soldivetereteran open every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis is not robbed in the sugar cane industry." ""</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugarcane factories in the east of the region, which are after long inactive time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of the fact that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarcane industry has already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country in a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church had already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity: the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories remaining, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugarcane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade again.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain, according to the" "" "Agricultural Organization" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Food Organization." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go down with safety in history," "" "that's the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown came from a total of 98 sugar mills, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as soldier, about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated most, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first round year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed to the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressat and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everyone was signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were increasingly frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the closed factory for two years and he was one who received letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugarcane mill."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years waiting for the retirement in another complex that Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the standstill of the factory, in whose construction he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to work and services, which were generated in the municipalities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut-speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, I learned that many things will change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory was closed, or rather, when they began to refuse it, they also listened to the road to asphalted, this is disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youth use Hip-Hop to express itself and maintain his own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities in Canada do deal with topics that are important to them. they do they do with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour since 2014, workshops will bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by pedagogues David Hodges who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten cree-communities and then worked together with the Cree hip hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is saying that the young participatory in talks, such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-responsive," or whatever it comes to the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actor.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations language.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help of Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a Strophe in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in a transcription, also a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "" "" "but I try to continue my days on earth" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you'll take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">"" "" "" "but I believe we will rise to one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and continue with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So, they can do that, for what it is appointed to the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the Strophe in Silenschrift (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes before almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly are on the menu, will be in close proximity to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (a lot of food, "Plastic models of the dishes") of each food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don't even relieve them anymore. a new trend is turned into current mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">When Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the shokuhin sani.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic-made decorative cell tapes, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificially foods have been transformed to kitten collects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shooting fridge for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of eating positions is becoming increasingly rising.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and molybdenum of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more skurrile plastic dishes you can view at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the exposure of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sani.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking," in Mexico, the fists and drinks are regularly reflected in statistics. this mirror does not reflect the extent of human tragedy that fight against this struggle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the trauma or to the congregations, who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal político has called the digital project "Aprender-Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking,") that shall give this sacrifice to a voice and stories of people who directed the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartons.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers, and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain's Pain</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is seeking secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost their father only one day, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>

<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You have to pay the insurance of my father, but it does not have paid them out because that demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">To explain why the editors "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show faces of those who pose a fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the leaders.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>

<seg id="780">I am passing every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I'm the only ones who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be considered normal or considered normal.</seg>

<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old Cousin thinks he will be Narco (German: drug dealers), if it's big. and it is also not normal that humans will hear songs about the "heroic" offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who have fear, that something happens to them as well.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they" "" "increased." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with this.</seg>

<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office included 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are still living in view of a new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender-Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, to represent the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But what is the years after something has emerged? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, inclined to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used misleading to describe tragedies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Do not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions concerning our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crosses the village Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kipple around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa had been neglected in the second biggest country for years and was devastated. the streets in the region have become a dangerous pillar of impact holes that were difficult to ride.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and destroyed bodies in the streets scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the divinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.more photos of the incident form the dreaming scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow bodies which coves on the ground, while people have a look at.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was tifished several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but it cannot be attributed to tragedies as well as events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the ableakian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and customs.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count bodies," "" "said one inhabitant of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">On the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsettled, but the army plant in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DRC appeared again, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this mischief use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of errors; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments, such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined together with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and some dead, some of burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported to the Rohingya, Posts reported like the following based on these descriptions with photos from the DRC:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page that was falsely claiming President Myanmars Than Being, monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrated this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of these false couplings reach back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A controversial picture-search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images below 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images that are very similar to the discussed picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masch private pages, platforms social media and community representatives as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page insisted that the President of Myanmar Tha came into being in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by now, has explicitly declared that the image is not taken by the killings but it claims that it was a "similar" jihadist attack. "</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later, in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute its connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The DR Congo image appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and disbanded a discussion among Muslims after the massacres of the Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was twitched as proof of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). however, the messages that were linked to them were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the target was to direct attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacres, it turned into circulation, and discussions like this in Vietnamese and declared it at the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message that was included in the image from the DR Congo, the organisation of Clarettin missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos appeared.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all of these cases, which appeared only considerably after the original disaster in 2010, the picture may ultimately be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that move these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions regarding the silence in relation to the murdered victims of Christians through Muslims or - in defense of Muslims - the murdered victims of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second questionnaire uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued at a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can't give these images to longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are salty people who have unintentionally contributed to the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggerants this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of nonviolent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it comes back from images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent pictures readers and viewers are looking to feel the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, study, such as forcible media).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are things to discuss nonviolent presentations in the news media, fact, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will need to think thoroughly about the situation, in which a picture is somewhat sugary, which can actually be used in the context or completely misuse species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation into a false assignment should also take into consideration how internationally they can.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) endeavouring to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in each language: they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unspeakable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sovesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression suffices not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bemba you for your parents in recognition of how you strive for yourself in your younger years." ""</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People, with whom I work or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar, which they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built themselves in their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They decomfy me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different art. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that once Muslims, which as I don't fit there, are muslified.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Abmuslimizated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I do not stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poet, whose poetry is sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was a Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran, and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western launch, religion Rumis deleted, just as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another one exists in the reconstructionist pictures of Muslims, which have been colonial books since centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting language is intended for the dark man to fear and the exotic woman that one should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said broke out the history behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1024">They continue our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working for thirteen years in the Intelligence industry and I have seen how this powerful, faulty scars will dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narratively overshadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the USA could not even choose their first female Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are inhibited to bear their headscarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group practising his "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements to change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also predicts that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afrikaners who had been brought to slaves with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative is occupied by our collective prefabrication, deep and erroneous, that often Sikh men and children are often antimental attacks and shikanings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell you and because of the way we tell them is Islamophobia today not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or in alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narrative, who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims are in the highest grade of the "diverse" religious group in America.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to enter here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Incredible Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, here is the focus of TLS not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is a try to obtain the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland is in the United States, where TLS has been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">Mass mortality of the world may be avoided, if we do cities, accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don't have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often this is linked to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "instead of listening to feel to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers exhibit their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation is that the audits can be adjusted on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou also takes the opportunity to explain the stories of narrative of the stories.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara relates the babel from Hoses and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the meaning of his Fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grinels he divides his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very near me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can arrange with TLS in contact to organize their own story stories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new survey of public debt in Puerto Rico, participating in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017, participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at pueranian Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group of "FrenaCiudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the Neuralment of the debt) and the Ökomenic Church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessation of the debt reduction of the debt has also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos calls for the politicians, bankers and government agencies that are responsible for debts to their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial examination and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding to the economy in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will press and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking pensioners.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated in the state of state of the United States - is suffering under a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socio-economic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing State view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed by the outside will be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizen, to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he performed for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year, and licensed here, contains a number of views that employ to deal with free culture on the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements to be built for free knowledge and what the true costs are associated with which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted in the Adra prison directory, which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper of Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel was based on a" strictly secret "drawn carriage of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who set themselves as the insider of the Assad government and set them from an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain unknown, but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in which access to Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the ladder of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes was foreseen as the work that he started around in 2005 with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the sign of numerous civilians and merging greek-Roman architecture types with hiesous traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strive into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public and for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically Bassel could not yet close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and he taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English good, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught others, to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opens me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others, as they were able to use computer, at least theoretically, without having stopped in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She prepared the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here is a passage from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens with every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose my mind in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers are no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, armchairs and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I will sing in every detail of your voice and words?</seg>
<seg id="1235">I wear passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say Lebeprobably</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul in you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To reclaim all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bass is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights), the Bashar al-Assad regime has disappeared more than 65.000 people according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or captured under violence through the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community announces the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, head of corruption was returned to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mosambians reacted with wrath on a corruption incident at which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus by which corruption was committed to corruption." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company, which was then on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of the General Attorney General of the Republic that granted the application, there would not be an obstacle to the Cambaza, back to his old position, as the company was not completed in custody after his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to set the Director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have incorporate a disciplines against the contraventions.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company failed, however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which has served half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid presentations and motivating speeches, he could advise and send his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to reintegrate into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambicans and student of political science in Brazil says the director no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone has rewarded him in such a way that the state has been so massively insulted by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morality to serve and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only served themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a hand it became a inexhaustible money source, and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was invited and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers it to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora of Machel in prison, but not only as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, longing and - next to the prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations was, when he was energetic, that "an ambitious human being able to be able, also the fatherland for its ambitions, its own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company, in which he promised funds to contract again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαx (@ acmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means kichery or spindbse.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the network because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though over the origin of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to refer to people in East Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censored the word "Kalar" or "You" (in burial scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely abnormative connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort, hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself is not calling us hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people reported that too, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts that they were expressed in the use of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burial words with fundamental different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spindbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, if she had kissed his back pain, he made a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questioner (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech against radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic must be, before all posts extinguishing to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filter the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on Faculook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, is carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spindbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this three-day nationalists, disseminating hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion has a powerful signal to all, hate speech, it doesn't like to keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of percussions are often a catch- and mouse game, with the users to use social networks, a new word or alternative typewrites of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his friend when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail from Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden to submit posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post of "the Facebook community standards did not say."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of people who have no negative intentions or trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asked advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a soothing intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to centime will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started using this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "inheritance curry".</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not tempting the falsibly deleted Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks auto censorship has sucked for a lot of mockery.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassar language to see if their podium are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmical text is "I want to sit on a chair and see peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, have used social networks in order to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in particular in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized to his burmese pages on his burmese pages, criticised into his burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of shaving the word 'Kalar', it would have better look at the context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously decided to ban a law that is intended to offer this practice, so the resilient age is now at 18.</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractor of the UN Child law, the minors than, every man under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Chancellery of the country confirmed that in 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were strives to abolish laws on children's before, followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's before they should be condemned to take care of their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition sought tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime there came doubts whether the opposition would agree to the law of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's condition - despite 4 channels (including a woman) of the Opposition and an independent who contained in the House of Representatives, where he would already make a simple majority to make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled, because the laws have been finally changed to the child's before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary Gerede used to wear the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was Jackson's opinion, it was definitely long enough to get the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1374">Thanks to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be approved, and he seems to dissolve his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General, Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it was quite right when Maharaj was going to act against the law, most social media users wished to go differently to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking, is that the state, our daughters, protects against them that they might be abused by large, hard-sponsored men that are against them in the advantage, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gradations or continue the norm, even though there are laws which they have to say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act on 18 January 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has closed the popular and the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day, more clearly how important the platform for users is to find helpless and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques were used for blocked web users (a current article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in an published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University were held, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform based on all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator), which is based on the system of domain name and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is disable despite the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost reports IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to complete snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the www.wikipedia.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent semen.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicum pe.org, an open source project of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hosten similar mirrors, when in the respective country Wikipedia is produced.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as employees in the Panigrahi's open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, an Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You can access a different URL, which is not the original. that which one sees is of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera for himself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepals can endeavour to get to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos depicting the attention of Nepals.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could it better give for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested me at home, when I was interested in Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was found and I immediately began to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to achieve cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood at faces from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb yourself from the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king's King appeared. he moves away immediately, we'll see you and he starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women deal with greatest care to address the names of their husbands or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns, or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should pay attention to the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Odisha through a criminal court and spurned by her family and the village community after she had responded a secretly called relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not name by name, is also common among men. however, they have much less concessions to fear when at all, they should not occur in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health subjects and housewives, were therefore quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the hostile of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and sets up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paola has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as childrens up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs were created a safe place for these women, and they have made it at the same time as ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion group did not show women who don't call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which the women can easily identifiable.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands, there is a breach not guilty of all rights and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this, is considered the postage, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done ourselves up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini who had never known her husband so far as the name of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Practice, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him at his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were being protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini displayed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women attempted to bring discussion with a practice in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which women married the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during all the exercise, she only decided to leave her, and another decided to leave all the frustration against him and his family, by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenaline, they decided to have broken with an ancient breach, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a wide variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law firm she was afraid, she was afraid, and said that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation held in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women did not complete it, but my" "" "they are now in a better position to choose even to bear him in some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are making a trip at each discussion group." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; she danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have played over some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, never said so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only known Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Most of them is okay, but some wanted to have a salvein spa, a wide shirt of a trousers; they have not dared themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own country code, the morals linked to the saris and much more, dingrough Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that the women may wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion lub has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps to date.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the review lub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - how to reach more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is the confidence of each of us that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and other people tell us what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Bar Association in New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people have to commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "to turn logic" "" "to defend the existing authorization of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, one can say that we were not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory violating.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanmugam were not very noisy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he appeared unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, it defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York; equally cities that are led permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old corer of the authoritarian feeder appears to be the pre-giving democrats, abandoned logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the final week, the answers given by Shanmugam gave answers to its American guests to our press, our predictive, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried more relevant questions with non-answer rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam, his opinion when she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his comment on the blog, he points to the reviews that you should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneasy, even if we look forward to free and righteous elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He justified Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "as he said," "" "Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader of a growing generation, making such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the minister of Justice of Singapore said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of old Garde, what I expected - was I understood with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes, right and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review marks the vulnerability of Shanmugams Argumente:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam was committed to a mistake, or was it a freudinal speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will be viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government choir, statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are the people of Singapur of their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In addition, the magazine Journey of a Decade to the Year, Singapore is and was always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singapur of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country mainly," etc., but that is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification, the default answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook inside of anger, if they are kept for Americans, but don't disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know it, there is little that distinguishes us Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible at her rucksack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">They all love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American by contrast....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the tolerant country.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>

<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, as "nice" means to be called to be spicuous - like the benign, gentle, but tragically, unsignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be harmless and uninteresting, and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remote off the things that pass around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">"" "" "" "I would even be going to say that the desire to be free and alone, a" "" "Canadian" "" "of Canadians" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a corrusive pink Brillenframe and golden earrings in Teddybular form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, brittle walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - despite hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes Mrs. Ramírez tells people to call people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "mommy Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is more quiet, but this year Ramírez had already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them to the hospital, when she is sick, she buys them medicines that cannot pay them, they massive them with a balm that had exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a son of yoghurt) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other directions from Mama Africa. "mum Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Africans often travel the route together and that Africans speak on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his waycompanion Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our Mother and we never let it go back," "" "he answered." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests send their often text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who are travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads to Jesengasse to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in her small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the airline tickets will be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was dismissed by a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press the money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single-stone, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, travellers consult the traveler quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud granddaughter she webs her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs at sad, while she briefly imagined her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fuerone," repeats it every time. "they are already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the City of Urumqi received a mobile notification where they refers to the district government, to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleansing").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, the app" "" "This app" "" "is said to have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities refused to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, breaking news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the release of the police, the app that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic web pages, by online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make user attentively, how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these features can be used naturally in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hackers could use the home network of a person to manipulate or from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote countries like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures, as well as routinemy Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">On Twitter based media oulet "Images from Mainland China" (a lot of charge), the censored news in China showed photos of a checkpoint where the policemen were disposed of the residents of the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They compelled people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by accident technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (To-rise), also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus ensures unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computer and cell phones are in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities, and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is apparently any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of different possible verses, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning is fulfilled the space ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I reply with the voice of an exhaustive young people: "my lord, my father has to be fearful worried."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be quiet, and go away, you are moved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he shroud to his screen, and again to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigar between his fingers, or to discover his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from her village in Palestine, in which she had lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, the conservative majority of the conservative majority of gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapesmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often refers to topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only found in its hometown of Amman, but also in cities that reach Damascus in Syria by far to Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited to his thinking through borders, and he can feel the most devastating effects of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it, he won a special discard against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war areas, something with his identity as "Palestinian refugee's second generation - so he was born himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he is dissolved in water, Nesadan. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sentimely called Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speak the loops of tepid coffee and the hose of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky, especially if one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of State Jordanians have cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections, supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the country's homosexual Frontiers, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman on the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" had been canceled "because of sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many say, the commitment to the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Free Speech in the Arab world be dangerous activism, responsible for the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights, who continue to use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be silently rhetoric, but actually a clear crystallized reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in the Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional gender norms to be born by his vision of the fate of Arab women who made voyhelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently known unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, in Jordan the number of 'honorary morde' has increased - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honour of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women, victims, attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for fragile control from the year 1954, women who are subjected to danger of internal family violence, "and for their release often is a longlasting bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family, that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, also not to relieve the issues surrounding the country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, a fact that he is his music that is full of explicit assumptions on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "me became a sinking," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed, Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everybody else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want "- be faith or not, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineage roya in order to note that his comments were torn off the context, and his opinion has been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a working version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is wondering: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was to work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do it not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government is sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service accepted several former government officials and members of the teaching industry, with the grounds that they would have expressed themselves on commentations in social media, which interned with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert Hdaibs, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural rethinking in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Mashrou'Leila is going to take action for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, depressing and internal changes. it is certain that this changes from day to day will take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to do "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streetunitions and artificial type of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue to continue to resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was presented by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which is part of the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Those big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a version of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the Festwagen, the drums, and dancing over more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen since a long time: two fixed cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebula Festival is the only true truth - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre high-car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external apparition and body care were so important as in this history, because they are helping to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressing.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for Aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports enthusiasts such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to attract more normality into the experienced hands of hairdressing which can make this elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, who go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show who can create the centrisky leooks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitors are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who finds himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to communicate her weapons against hair tools, and instead of bad advice to get a training in the hairdresser art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the variety of opportunities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession, currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year, the school offered special training workshops in March and reported about some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud, because of love to the children we have constructed this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the "Liebesbotanism" guerrillas "guerrillas, published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who are cast out to teach affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Young-Youth Foundation. the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer out of the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), which encourage young people to write a letter of guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the site of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after a long negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC movement (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered significant as the signatory of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before Colombia, there is still a long way to reach from a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrities, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock carrying their weapons in themselves, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company, again, who had used to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred toward guerrilla struggles, must record these in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columnist will join together and in the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messenger to former guerrillas, to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrillas - who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Laureate, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people we love to write on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need them much needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told it further to share his love with people who needed the urgent action in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March in one of the United Nations camps.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation Bogotia traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC behaved as they had done before, to counter the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of undertaking people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighters led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cottage where the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomegranate, a fatal weapon in the thorn-bernation.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "I suddenly answered the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would give me a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up and the FARC had already been in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC proclaimed the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to make society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed by:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people, who had never heard hearing and had no voting rights, and to know that people who often have been seen as Monster and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned through their lifestyle and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the land lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm have done to us, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columnist has been made aware that peace would reign after the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to lift up and protest for their rights, and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution, and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us who defend life as foundation of existence, many difficulties are coming up.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queens live in Caucasian region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and compressors.</seg>
<seg id="2244">In terror, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months of the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that such as a Damoklesschwert depends on the LGBTQ community is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">LGBTQ's legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines before several months after reports were published that the trapping, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took the suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya had experienced by the gender equality of her Landswoman, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life she brought her last end to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought of whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round about a matter of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was right there, a few grocery bags from the back of my car, I heard a men's voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: how long will you honor the family still, you swallow? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up the last end of the hospital in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get along and started to screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital, I learned that I had two counts on my right pulmonary organ.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nursing wings were you laid - in whom men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to send me to Chechnya to prove to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said me, I have to prove it out by the streets; others wanted me to go up in the official TV in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only evil and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körbchensize C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They brought a monster to the world, not just your family, but the whole republic is damaged." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and a few hours later under the window a car with darkened window discs and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time happened, it became clear that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to offer their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without record without me, without ID card, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into a hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe in security, just because you have forsaken the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you use. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, however, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasual elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I could not overcome this seelic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I really give me effort to look like the person out of their past - so in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person, and at the end, a evidence that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC media: are men still held in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine, there was just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have not submit their relatives or were left by their relatives, to place Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are consumed, they will show their bodies in television, claiming they would have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but submerged to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a assumption, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just got someone who was incarcerated in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was growing.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were involved.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as a bandits, there was no reports yet. however, we assume that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave off?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already familiar with Grozny in 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to lead us to the "Civilization," but at the end of time he was thrown back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stuffed up; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Scharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and all the city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a guile: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when people make good fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you because they believed they are ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this mercy endured?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us per se, but above the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had blown before and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreffs, acting, I run it to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend long cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I abrupt it.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help you need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth, that there is no sponges with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have Cabardiner also who, the Russians also have those; on the whole planet it gives them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during the Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about transitions of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusty.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all. I just know that I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of self-mords within the impoverished Arab Ahmad community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-moratorium.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmad community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness, which may benefit the inability to his family, so Ahmad Human Rights groups that remain in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube, the moments after he had been ignited.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people were able to extinguish the flames back, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the combustion were so strong that doctors could not do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab ancestral minority, and activists warned that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmad Centre for Human Rights announced that this month, some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and incapable of fighting their families and to pursue safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmad suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of the Arab-Nazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to consolidate their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and took power in 1925, making ethnic autonomy for all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most influential and most precious agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and emptying.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the ancestral regime in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of tribal, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas, where the provinces are Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Goma.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate below the Arab AHawaiian youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are seeking a work that completed primary school, 55% has completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of self-morant among the young Ahmad men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse, the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functionaries and institutions are prefers to set the Arab labor force, the local Arab Ahmadazi will have access to workoptions in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their pre- and surnames to hide their affiliation to the ancestor, because even the Arab names will not be tolerated in the workplace, because the speech of the Arab language or the trams of Arab clothes are not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Faced with the given circumstances which the Arab Ahmadazi must bear, human rights activists beat alert, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains waiting, whether the world is waking up and knowledge of it.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroférias. the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought about scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why should we generally be all Feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still deserve less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to what they may do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I speak to what kind of physical, physical and verbal have been abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But are they all in that women - all women - they should come together to sing "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutional form of racial forms, which we are exposed to black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin less deserve white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to black spears and women with migrant backgrounds to suffer higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women, all men and all those who have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not take myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman, who refuses to consider unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which refer to gender as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented spear, which always has rejected me and countless other black women and again rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In her speech, Sojourner mourned 1851 in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and also I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me factions, which also absorb our customs clearance and customs, in order to push their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to get white women the importance of overleness of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to give them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women a home in various forms and borrowed from white feminism, still the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of me full and completely by feminism, and called me the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than to use me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubbornly that intersecality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women in our own ideas and give us into the Spines that will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana vanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they can defend ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which account for the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call, after they read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I have existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment, in which my life is neither exaggerated, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kurier. the article belongs to the series # PorMuMujer (# softer-free), which reports over the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Asda Báez, that she has nothing against Luis Balbuena, their expartner who had become violent over violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said, their statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed for abuse of abuse, there is also a useful display of Ada Báez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make any display at all, they generally receive no support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also are financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 strokes and Statistic 2 Unvisible abuse and a legal system, which does not undernimmt3 Canays laws: good approach, flawed realization and stats</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women really mistreated, says Myrian González, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are various specifications and reports that show not even ansatto the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Office of the Public Attorney General (9600 ads) went to violence against women for domestic violence. at 70% of it, violence against women went.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads during the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace-judicial authorities. 86% of the ads added here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically treated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on every woman who is refunded for physical abuse, two women, who do not do this," "" "explained the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">As women's murder in Paraguay is no own crime, the prosecution authorities cannot be documented, as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists told at least 12 cases of female places in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman died because of violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible misuse and a legal system that doesn't undertake nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning they didn't want to do this, but then, however. this should always regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana has 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she wore the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time that recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that the only women had happened to be submissive, because they are deceited by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana took advantage of social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered them, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long of Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victim of abuse at least had a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they misled them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others don't do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed to an unmistakable legal battle between Paraguay and their homeland, where it was mainly around money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law cannot be effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interhuman relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink must take place, so violence is no longer considered a little rower.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is done with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is not rare or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research, there are two reasons for lack of medical health and vaccines, which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries in Africa, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists itself, and its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samba health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstanding of the media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Varrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I supported the samba national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only rely solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise, we will always remain the recipient to be rather than Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special research training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from that.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the easy access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodically make articles accessible only to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been chill out in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company provides 114 varieties such as outlet, the first plant grown by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years of work, Morton was placed only by his own accident and the question how many salts can he get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more salads were patented, and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for single varieties but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotary or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more such patents have been registered on more plants such as grain or cartottensorship. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmentalists and experts for food security ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still finds lettuce, however he needs longer, as his work is always more difficult for his work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock rock would lie in a river around which I have to paddling." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, nobody can breed any more new salad, because all characteristics are patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tries to stimulate those characteristics which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman salat in the "greenhouse" house of the station. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds like that, as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seed sound) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake that others can freely use them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed. "open source" breeders only allow others to breed their seed to breed as their own varieties, and it is not immediately available - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the home professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and opportunity to breed new plants, both important for nutrition security than also for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed also plays a role in larger cladding such as Biodiversität, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little to breed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and takes care of becoming more frequently more frequently-increasing awareness among farmers in August and September 2016. "" "" "" "who wants to buy locally, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, should also know that the way is bred on farms as such as this vegetables is bred." ""</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary confidently without seed-friendly people is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make other their seed still freely available. in contrast, their approach is to be patented, in contrast, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters, that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genpool due to the increasingly abundant spiritual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited, disable shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the director of Ossi, employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all cartotments are protected as intellectual property, which is either not usable for plant breeding or not just a value.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that massenrich plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visitors</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such a way through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently more than ever before, as the changed conditions are foreseen by climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an E-Mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four gences and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry, the company set up for conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is, however, the view that intellectual property increases other breeders, as "patents and protection of plant varied innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that can follow up as soon as the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations, but it promotes the public more materials and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years for waiting, until a patent loop, makes sure no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is however, that genetic Resources would have been a common good, and there should continue to remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we don't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton does not bother in the concept to patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them up and as breeders have no idea, how plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety, will also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures are believed to grow significantly in their varieties of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving to international markets but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, there are most smaller seed companies, even without any patents - either to refuse it, or do they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The Frank Morton's independent plant breeding is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders is innovative by using plant patents innovative: "it looks like I have been using my efforts to produce something new, more than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years, "he says." with a patent it is only 20 years ahead of competition, making it easy for my opinion. "worldwide Resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">"" "" "" "indeed, the US seem to be a leader in the" "" "Open Source" "", "which is now spreading rapidly around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed programme. the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to satisfy certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol works on an "open source" license which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeders differ from land to country, because the Ossi obligation is not just being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows the patents in a farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring to the patent office to implement these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards sponsorship of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for" "" "open source" "" "seed systems responsible for" "" "Open Source" "" "seed systems that is currently a global alliance for" "" "open source" "" "seed systems that should be scheduled next year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies, such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report. in this case, it represents the view that farmers should have the opportunity to enhance and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply of food security can be ensured.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock content in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August the Egyptian government closed the website of the World Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about selfish.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The World Network for Human Rights Information Party - despite this attack and violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities, so it was never so important to pursue this goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the sperm and not reimitate us. we hope to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of webinations to the victims. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI also there is no access to Egypt's blog of columnists and Human Rights Studies Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he was set to circumvent the censapparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of also native to Ziadas blog, is on the other hand accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while taking over the student protests and took a video how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly round about politics and the rights of human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the lock of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, a attempted murder, forecharge at the National Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other web site, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't wrote in vain. in other words: my words have influence, though only a little audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a Archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the item of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muters go the way up to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this is technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, through the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12th of June, we saw how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block up content and filter to filter access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally embellished, so that the penal decisions can be hit behind closed doors, which allows the Egyptian population to act as a rule against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo of: estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest city of the country and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14 year old was shot in school" "" "Jeden second day is assassinated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Open pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the Army, Marine and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a well-called financial situation, the violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports, such as these are daily, and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16th the Editorial "This is not normal," which they announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything that however only happened in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we do not close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes said that this decision was no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure to be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war rate, when it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then asks questions to conceal.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" harm more than they benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued over a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to make responsibility for the police force.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra at the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with non-sufficient investment in personnel, education, and historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">The Globo company, the largest media company in South America, is an extra part of the Company Globo, which is emphasized as Cecília, the State policy of the State for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">On this safety policy measures the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, formed a police unit whose goal is to capture a massive police force and stationed a unity permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of nonviolent deaths. since a few years the UPP had to protect the UPP but after several reports on poor communities and repression against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his article published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio cannot represent - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this calls for the state to implement means and ways that are typical for war." "" "the intrusion into the territory of a" "" "enemy" "", "which is a civilian point in the countryside, and to the object for" "" "collateral damage" "" "and" "" "spheres" "". "" ""</seg>
