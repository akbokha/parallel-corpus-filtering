that is James R@@ isen .
they may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he has spectacular , that the NSA had heard illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , in which the CIA had literally disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not like ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and ying journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ zzle , they do .
so when the government was ank@@ le anchor , he did something that many cour@@ ageous reporter did before him : he refused , and told that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although they had years for years , it would be indispensable in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and scra@@ p , they could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so investig@@ ators , without his permission , conf@@ essed his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , credit rating , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ky source .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower in his presence , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more possibilities to exp@@ ose all .
but just like technology the government allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the voucher .
today , there is communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is essentially more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transition system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swar@@ tz , which has been developed today by Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been developing further .
rather than sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the Government can no longer compl@@ ain about information , and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available in advance .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments on all over the world develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us .
it is possible to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to kill ini@@ quities . it is equally important that we protect the next che@@ ek@@ leb@@ lower ,
the lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers must be informed and reported by over@@ filled hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm on the contaminated water of F@@ lint . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider which warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; 3 April 2016 &#93; the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ äch@@ men &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous pur@@ sum@@ s of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; This week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s non @-@ resident law firm Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already been led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has been re@@ signed .
there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ators of Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letter of letters in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion is leading Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , on a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there &apos;s a lot of rich people and others to wait , that are nervous on the next release , and to reveal documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agency controller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems wine from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few to be used to hide their assets and to spare - something that we have been discussing for ten years .
I think many people will love this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for tra@@ ce@@ ability and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations that occurred in this scandal .
well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library identity card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees to withdraw school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters , especially vulnerable an@@ arch@@ ers .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does this work ?
so we sent an uncovered investig@@ ator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made by our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no eman@@ ating money was handed over . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not work for a single lawyer , who under@@ spread our hidden investig@@ ators .
it does not work for a single top polished , wrapped in a scandal .
it &apos;s about how the system works by corruption , tax cur@@ ses , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior compl@@ ain .
this may sound very sore , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as born optim@@ ist , I definitely see that some have begun to change .
in the past few years , we have seen signs to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has captured in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches .
we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk a red Maz@@ das would be landed .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and took a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excited how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to move from the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
at night , I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man , what have I broken up there ?
a wild person sleeping in my living room .
what if it &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I went out of the bed , ti@@ pping up to the door , and lock out my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my angle .
maybe the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , and my ro@@ omm@@ ates , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can do it , fear in having fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ants Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ fro@@ ze on wood floors .
they thought it was great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and rent our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile was lit .
but they do not .
nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned children , strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you can see yourself on the things that you can do . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to do through design immense trust , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree of confidence we stri@@ pped .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hands .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your dis@@ closed cell phone your left sitting room .
this quiet flight of panic , which you feel right now -- is exactly what you will feel when they open the door the first time .
because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the dis@@ closed cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of you feel the responsibility .
so also , most guests feel if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would only have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he would have told how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 convic@@ tions that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ closed cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to take negative convic@@ tions .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest submitted their ass@@ essments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little surprising we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less you trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if you have less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sti@@ cking common common@@ alities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we discovered that confidence is dependent on how much you are budget .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re telling too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips to which topics one should write .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we had not expected , the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us , business is running very well .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or homes .
hosts have been invited guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing worse than that calls . it hur@@ ts already , if I just think .
the dis@@ appointment that one li@@ stens to the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million were only a fraction ever .
because people trusted one another .
if confidence works , it can develop sc@@ rub@@ ble .
one of our guests did holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers looking to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
they drive through a car in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to get lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer , without charge extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of part with money trans@@ actions fit together ?
it &apos;s all about an economic trade .
but it just doesn &apos;t just call &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter will not be justified .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people have a portion of itself openly , and this changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
however , what if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in every place you have visited a group there would be waiting to fill a thor@@ ough and one at a pub drive neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy .
what would be if we would like to share apartments of the ground for toge@@ ther@@ ing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the idea of joint participants ?
I imagine cities that allow us company and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and rep@@ ay@@ ment .
South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government .
residents were now offered . students who were looking for a stay ,
were medi@@ ated in people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ators started .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , over our platform only 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even a host .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the bike .
we also had great hospitality before .
there were similar websites already before .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence .
design can help us overcome , profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time when a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know of course that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use the design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ undering , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people , which look like me .
a study concluded that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met any Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ s @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to have it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to carry out the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you attack yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , and compared to the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal .
I have not just passed the faith of my parents .
I got the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after he was in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understands , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and living in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jum@@ ped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into anger .
why should I do something ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; &#91; ... &#93; ... &#93; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st Mecca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I was silent -- as we left silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time being aware of the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful in good lit places , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t hurt you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to the b@@ eten .
and again waiting the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably about , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , and struck free .
there were really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not felt right .
because the people who attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I tried the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to declare himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are Invent@@ ors and Te@@ ach@@ ers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympic Ris@@ ks .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques be safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular attendance of a mosque leads to consider people other faith toler@@ ate , and greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it has found that he will start online . as a result , the person is cut off from their church , so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stick to people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Muslim , as mother , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to their ancest@@ ral world if you acknowledge it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology behind their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you thro@@ ws a look at them , they do not drives what they are in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which you can read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
a remarkable I@@ mam recently told me an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because she was curtain to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her meaning for un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that gave their anger sense , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts who told you a solution .
this I@@ mam ordered the connection to God and her congregation .
rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he revealed its construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , she kept them to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear ourselves , there are at least three things .
we accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you have reported test individuals , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims were shot at top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction of the Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it may actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to promote the foundation of a free society , reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear makes us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ cence , it is not only about to explain ones@@ elf .

he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a sealed young man from my breasts ? &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit by Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had posted in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ atism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone towards the mosque or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was because America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam made a announcement , thank you and welcomed our guests , because half of the assem@@ blies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us .
in that moment , I am broken .
these people were there , because they had taken courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ atism ?
will you go safe to number ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you so much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you are saying that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought with deep dive , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say about those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so ordinary as it is allowed .
if one looks to the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever done study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem to usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is short before , to become a Billi@@ on@@ business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air Pak@@ s entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting connections , flight machines reach high speed and acceleration on narrow space .
you can also build sel@@ ectable structures as well .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight .
in order to create a system autonomous , it must know collective en@@ coding , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic growth .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available to the highest eb@@ ies , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device , which tries to beat two flies with one lap .
like other Star@@ r@@ ushes , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and so great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind b@@ ö@@ en .
we develop new control and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter what location can be recovered and performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often introduce ourselves fundamental abstract questions , to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate in order to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilot flying equipment could fly , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
at long we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical and sim@@ pl@@ est plane . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross beams , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inner life , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly if I see all , is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
this is why it is ambitious in his alignment .
therefore he receives the greatest ability ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ eller .
some can be dar@@ able in models , the rest will learn directly with flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flight machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft machines .
this revol@@ ves around the clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine though .
we will demonstrate this now , making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic sw@@ amp .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alizing technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as there would be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages in the development and the creative act act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever pi@@ ds allowed them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the door is on the i .
thank you very much .
approximately 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes were always faster , they conver@@ ts so the mass thre@@ ef@@ oot in one tenth customer in pure energy .
this short moment was brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they were unable to put their energy in the form of light --
we eventually talk of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time emotions and explo@@ ded the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange events at the time .
just 1.3 billion years ago it had just emerged on Earth .
since then Earth has caused some point : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser det@@ ector designed to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about colon@@ ization black holes .
most kept them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the detection capacity enor@@ m@@ ously .
therefore we call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes through the earth through .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my to@@ y@@ ill father .
basically , that were the fruits of my life cycle .
all that I had worked for what I had worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their by observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a c@@ ort@@ ment in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content will expand into a direction and into the other .
to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers in courses lead to Rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a proper dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched out on the waves of the waves and conf@@ is@@ cated . the strain of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore the Lig@@ o employees explained to crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic fact . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; technical difficulties during construction such det@@ ectors are huge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ der@@ ous and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than things around us : facial expressions , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or map of things , by taking the lights coming from several points to see you around .
with tones that is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm , and volume to close up the story behind .
&quot; now she &apos;s talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can not make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by taking changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear the All literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very fast , one stop the same cir@@ cus with an additional pitch . it sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u
it is a kind of movement of motion , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ ders Sp@@ ush &#93; No@@ body , who knows what he must hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ times sun mass , which turn around as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : consider ourselves short , what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in the All , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , orbit around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to investigate the Al@@ ls as they never had previously been possible .
on this way , we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in all we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about it all .
however , the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never pass through , as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the pri@@ ck is covered by its own neighbour .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most import@@ antly , I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things which we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we don &apos;t have any idea , we can only discover that we are listening to .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first start of what we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars to produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different angles on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory -- a very new generation of Observ@@ atory on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a year long I would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it was annoying to me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , I was afraid , and removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life , on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; ch@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
she once asked her if I could play with her , when I was just my jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from then , I &apos;m going to play with them as soon as you &apos;re going to do with them . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I try very much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career saved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , get off for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I create television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show provides hundreds of jobs that existed before .
the budget for a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
one new episode every nine days , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : one scandal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one another on Thursday night .
around the world , my series run in 256 languages for 30 million spectators throughout the world .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans for bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , so I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with this .
I tell you , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard to see if you talk about a company , a country or a household to take me seriously when I say that I am not just around computer , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat - no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m working in work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always creating a country out of nothing .
it is , when I set troops on a screen when I painted troops .
as a dream one made a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and toxic@@ ating , funny and dis@@ rup@@ tive , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work is well running .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume if I think to them the sum@@ s that I am talking about writing that the writing is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began working with TV production when I started working and work to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than in size .
the feeling , not unlike any other than to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for the failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask .
to make one clear : the more successful I get , the more episodes , the more there are no more work , the more things more at the same time , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I created , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that her mom is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sw@@ ings was broken .
I made the same thing as always : the same ti@@ amen work , 15 hours days , performed weekends , no repent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps not , does not exist with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so , what do you do if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ p you out , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you are doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher when you know the sum@@ s , and know how the sum@@ s feel when the sum@@ s stopped , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song listen to my heart , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; Sh@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
it does not call any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here it changes all my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special about it .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ mons , can &apos;t do anything but to watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m silent .
the country , which I created , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , juni@@ ors and the song in which it goes , or whatever the girl gets rid of &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy station comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the workers &apos; work , the Titan@@ ic@@ um@@ men , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are , if I say to you , who I am I am managing the programs and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not force and it is not specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I &apos;ll say Yes .
I do this as a firm rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice unless I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it was so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise so , how do you work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer my workplace than at home .
this confes@@ sion is painful , for what a man do rather than to be home ?
well , I am .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am relaxed , none of them .
we are in the garden around , and back , and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always feel after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can do it too ! you always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a meeting .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different .
they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and I am talking about my teenage daughter for all 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each one can lift 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes away !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children would have been finished .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my goodness , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for its soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m lucky and I wins . friends meet , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why don &apos;t you allow yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door , the energy goes in and I find me in my office again . I hear an unknown tune , she meets me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I use it in full swing and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... not anymore .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful to that .
it &apos;s easy to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I never saw a Titan Poker &apos;s journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I run , the marathon , the heavy sound that I run , the sw@@ amps , the sw@@ ans , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel the sum@@ s , the more is this unusual , stable , naked and new life feeling in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I &apos;ll draw you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little more familiar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you so much .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ support healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor that attempts to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
sure , they have heard of one of the most famous one of the most famous , &quot; deep @-@ breaking stimul@@ ation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to improve the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was Senior Consult@@ ant and worked on the emergency day and night .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that in the brain @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is attached and the skull pressure is increasing .
to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure .
for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what can I do with this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells of a tissue are growing , comparable to small children who are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François abolished .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
maybe you know from the bi@@ ology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising , this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them at higher concentrations near the brain .
but this is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , which allows the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells precisely , as it did Jean @-@ François
and they are looking for colour@@ less to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the entrance examination of the same individual .
we call the autonomous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in the prescribed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ tes we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken back after a couple of weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we used an injury and im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells help a monkeys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual business task .
you had to take feeding pellets from a tablet .
they made it very well .
when they had reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we last in the mot@@ ex Cort@@ ex of the mot@@ mot@@ oric range .
as a result , the monkey were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand more .
just as it would happen to humans , they recovered spontane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover themselves with the help pl@@ asti@@ ty brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys , who re@@ covering spontane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before inf@@ rin@@ gement .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after irrit@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do that . &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials involving human trials .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one needs to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you look forward to the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first really prove that it &apos;s useful before you can offer this treatment each .
BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we are making a big mistake in the West , as of course .
we see the democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ge@@ aring .
we believe capitalism does inev@@ it@@ ably lead to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great night in Beijing have doub@@ ted that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is cra@@ w@@ ling with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ introduced Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our election -- did not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ speak@@ able friends that would be repeated to me if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without democracy , our societies are m@@ ens@@ ed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
for the issue of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws its long shadow about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt mountain ,
but few are known to recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is one of un@@ used spar@@ ers and corporations , who could have been productive to invest there , where it could be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt hill , and also to produce all the things that mankind is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twins summit , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the U.S. , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently , a low demand for protecting the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who would not invest a low demand that would not be able to kill the prophecy that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ wanted the circumstances that lead him to kill him .
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
its extremely dirty art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for rescue the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of social form , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy got too many of course --
women , foreig@@ ner , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to imp@@ ose the job value of ath@@ etic democracy because of these ex@@ changes .
the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working arms , but it is not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial that they had the right to vote on political mit@@ ment to the same voting rights in question of stat@@ ure .
although Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long ago --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also burned quickly .
however , our modern liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but at Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling party .
because the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy was possible , and the democratic process was in@@ stituted , while the economy -- so the world of corporations - was a democratic revolution .
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ tary struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually emigrated to politics and dis@@ ma@@ stered it .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not have more like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is obvious that you can still be in the government today , and yet not in power because the power of politics into the economy is dis@@ cer@@ ated and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of boot@@ ing , which is so sustain@@ ably the animals of which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they may be star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that strengthens the policy so far , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , the ine@@ quality rises , the overall economic demand , and the managing director of the corporations are anxi@@ ous to invest cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism , the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the welfare of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t talk very well .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only reg@@ ain a wonder as in the ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low noise employed by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation will be higher than the twin peaks , and the social conflicts deeply , as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we make the re@@ united area more democratic , otherwise we end in a disease surveillance Hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy which can appear in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , so , whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is , whether capitalism is wrong by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to those in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in machinery the people are serving , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it need to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of enterprises : ask for a capital market before you &apos;re working and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and income originate and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein , and employees working there , but the company does not belong to those who work there . no exchange between capital and work , no great g@@ aps between investment and Save , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trading deficit or trade surplus of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , it wasn &apos;t the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we have a re@@ united politics and economy in particular .
the world that I describe you is the same time liber@@ ating , in which they are privileged persons preferred , and mar@@ x@@ is@@ tically , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ back of history , and key@@ nesi@@ an , globally key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or are we going to ship in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically politically .
it is in our hands , and we are doing it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian mar@@ xi@@ est .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West in China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the note of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most ab@@ yss is - the area of economy -- a totally democratic zone .
in a sense if I must say the pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles Britain of the 19th century .
for -- Do you remember - we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- it is an error , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China , resem@@ bles very much development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now want to do what the West has done in the 19th century , it sm@@ ells of the hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure to adopt a massive failure line through the Eurozone , and continues to operate massi@@ vely in the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion was to reveal this failure --
it is true . unfortunately , the powers are within the euro zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system that is not viable , by political will and auth@@ oriz@@ ism in life , you may have to delay a while , but if the change occurs , he is ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change their setup .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in such an appropri@@ ated situation , claiming that he did not make mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the cancellation programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money @-@ leg@@ islat@@ ure to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to carry out our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the publishers who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , imposed on us these policies , conf@@ essed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive meditation of the conversations , you seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cri@@ tique of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and love Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive .
for if it does not survive , the released fli@@ pper will be dam@@ aging and the European Union will destroy .
this will not have consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we probably are the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we propose ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future of Europeans , as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
due to Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision , which Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is introduc@@ tory employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ atine and describes on Twitter as a &quot; film , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it , shows the shows and contents to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these shows shows such as &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where , after one saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not feel about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle expression , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire them .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and presents them online , where they can watch each free of charge .
and if Amazon exists for free things , do you interv@@ ene , right ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ au@@ ds , which parts you can ski@@ p or watch out again .
they collect millions of data to choose with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- as the average sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for this , but he makes it something different .
rather than arrange a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows it etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had together all the parts , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four channels , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years in statistics as back @-@ up .
optimized by very powerful computers .
the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we get more and more statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come with it in touch , you are in prison .
if a man is in prison here and for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not that a company does not know how multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
these data are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is estimated to predi@@ ct them by data analysis of flu , the worse species , predic@@ tions -- through data analysis of Google resear@@ ches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success was published in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data emerg@@ es in the decisions of life -- at work , in case of en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer treatment
or development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions on data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread .
you need to solve a complex problem , mainly two things :
as a result , you can make this problem in his individual parts , so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place you put the parts back together to get a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and open again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to meet the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , for what they could not have been able . but the decision to make all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they went a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and that &apos;s not forgotten , this device is rather useful .
thanks to you ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will later see it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have met some choices in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in the after@@ ward .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by a little more sophisticated , like data analysis to make better choices .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is at us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I received this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying , decisions make , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you so much .
