<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he has spectacular, that the NSA had heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA had literally disproportionate drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and ying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Muzzle, they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was ankle anchor, he did something that many courageous reporter did before him: he refused, and told that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years for years, it would be indispensable in their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and scrap, they could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so investigators, without his permission, confessed his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, credit rating, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and risky source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower in his presence, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more possibilities to expose all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the voucher.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is essentially more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transition system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, which has been developed today by Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been developing further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rather than sending an e-mail, go to a news website, as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the Government can no longer complain about information, and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments on all over the world develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is possible to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to kill iniquities. it is equally important that we protect the next cheekleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers must be informed and reported by overfilled hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm on the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3 April 2016] the largest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Mächmen] have hidden [enormous pursums of Global Witness.] [what does that mean?] This week we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness to an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's non-resident law firm Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already been led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has been resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictators of Bashar al-Assad's letter of letters in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of $2 billion is leading Russia's President Vladimir Putin, on a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there's a lot of rich people and others to wait, that are nervous on the next release, and to reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency controller or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wine from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing such as secret tax havens of some few to be used to hide their assets and to spare - something that we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will love this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for traceability and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations that occurred in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after this tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library identity card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees to withdraw school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters, especially vulnerable anarchers.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered investigator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made by our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no emanating money was handed over. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single lawyer, who underspread our hidden investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not work for a single top polished, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works by corruption, tax curses, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior complain.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sore, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as born optimist, I definitely see that some have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen signs to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that arise and say: "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax curses, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the trunk a red Mazdas would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and took a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me excited how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep today tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to move from the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night, I was in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man, what have I broken up there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild person sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I went out of the bed, tipping up to the door, and lock out my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, and my roommates, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can do it, fear in having fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow occupants Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airfroze on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and rent our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile was lit.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you can see yourself on the things that you can do. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to do through design immense trust, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree of confidence we stripped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your disclosed cell phone your left sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic, which you feel right now -- is exactly what you will feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the disclosed cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of you feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also, most guests feel if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would only have imagined with his name; if he would have told how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions that all say: "he can really hold very well-closed cellphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to take negative convictions.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less you trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sticking common commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we discovered that confidence is dependent on how much you are budget.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're telling too little, for example "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- "" "-- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great art works in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips to which topics one should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not expected, the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have been invited guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than that calls. it hurts already, if I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one listens to the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million were only a fraction ever.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, it can develop scrubble.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers looking to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save lives, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive through a car in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to get lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's all about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just doesn't just call "rental industry," the matter will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People have a portion of itself openly, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, what if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place you have visited a group there would be waiting to fill a thorough and one at a pub drive neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like to share apartments of the ground for togethering?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the idea of joint participants?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us company and relationships, instead of solitude and repayment.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korea's capital, Seoul, has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents were now offered. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated in people whose children were moved. there were incubators started.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, over our platform only 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the bike.</seg>
<seg id="245">We also had great hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites already before.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome, profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time when a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use the design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain laundering, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study concluded that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met any Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegs-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to carry out the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you attack yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist independence of independence, and compared to the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unbeatable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I got the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after he was in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmik sometimes brings me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "I had later, after my marriage, a child, and living in the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into anger.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "in the name of Islam..."... "[...]...]..." Jihadist Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu related me the deeds of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I was silent -- as we left silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time being aware of the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Be careful in good lit places," "Don't hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to the beten.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again waiting the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably about, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, and struck free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branding on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I tried the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to declare himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are Inventors and Teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympic Risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular attendance of a mosque leads to consider people other faith tolerate, and greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has found that he will start online. as a result, the person is cut off from their church, so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stick to people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as mother, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">"" "" "" "but we would add to their ancestral world if you acknowledge it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers." ""</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology behind their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you throws a look at them, they do not drives what they are in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which you can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A remarkable Imam recently told me an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she was curtain to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her meaning for unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that gave their anger sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who told you a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam ordered the connection to God and her congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse them for their anger, he revealed its constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, she kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear ourselves, there are at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you have reported test individuals, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims were shot at top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction of the Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It may actually be a tool to manipulate the public to promote the foundation of a free society, reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear makes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the sweetest, generous person, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a sealed young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit by Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had posted in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone towards the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was because America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, thank you and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had taken courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go safe to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you so much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you are saying that you are a TEDTalk, a thought with deep dive, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say about those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one looks to the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever done study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem to usually appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, is short before, to become a Billionbusiness.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air Paks entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting connections, flight machines reach high speed and acceleration on narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build selectable structures as well.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to create a system autonomous, it must know collective encoding, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic growth.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available to the highest ebies, e.g. "start" and landing. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device, which tries to beat two flies with one lap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrushes, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can hover, and so great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind böen.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new control and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter what location can be recovered and performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often introduce ourselves fundamental abstract questions, to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate in order to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilot flying equipment could fly, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">At long we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical and simplest plane. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross beams, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inner life, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly if I see all, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a practice in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propeller, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why it is ambitious in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Therefore he receives the greatest ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propeller.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be darable in models, the rest will learn directly with flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propeller aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves around the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine though.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now, making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swamp.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localizing technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as there would be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages in the development and the creative act act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever pids allowed them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the door is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Approximately 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes were always faster, they converts so the mass threefoot in one tenth customer in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment was brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they were unable to put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We eventually talk of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time emotions and exploded the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange events at the time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just 1.3 billion years ago it had just emerged on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then Earth has caused some point: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand up -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detector designed to search for gravitational waves, which arise about colonization black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer- Gravitational shafts Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the detection capacity enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collizing black holes through the earth through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my toyill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that were the fruits of my life cycle.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves of black holes and their by observatories such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a cortment in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content will expand into a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses lead to Relativity-theory often a proper dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched out on the waves of the waves and confiscated. the strain of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros according to the comma, followed by a 1. therefore the Ligo employees explained to crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic fact. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "technical difficulties during construction such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are finderous and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than things around us: facial expressions, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or map of things, by taking the lights coming from several points to see you around.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm, and volume to close up the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now she's talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has already been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, one stop the same circus with an additional pitch. it sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of motion, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard Ligo the following: [Surrenders Spush] Nobody, who knows what he must hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-times sun mass, which turn around as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: consider ourselves short, what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in the All, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 sones, orbit around one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to investigate the Alls as they never had previously been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can't see -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mass stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about it all.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the prick is covered by its own neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things which we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we don't have any idea, we can only discover that we are listening to.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first start of what we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars to produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different angles on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory -- a very new generation of Observatory on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>

<seg id="556">No matter whether it was annoying to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>

<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life, on an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all "chittens,"</seg>

<seg id="572">She once asked her if I could play with her, when I was just my jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-setting in my family. from then, I'm going to play with them as soon as you're going to do with them. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">"" "almost. I'm not perfect, but I try very much." ""</seg>

<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood that" "" "Yes" "" "to play with my children my career saved." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, get off for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I create television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for about 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show provides hundreds of jobs that existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">One new episode every nine days, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: one scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series run in 256 languages for 30 million spectators throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans for bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell you, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard to see if you talk about a company, a country or a household to take me seriously when I say that I am not just around computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm working in work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always creating a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops on a screen when I painted troops.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream one made a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and toxicating, funny and disruptive, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume if I think to them the sums that I am talking about writing that the writing is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working with TV production when I started working and work to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't strive differently than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike any other than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for the failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I get, the more episodes, the more there are no more work, the more things more at the same time, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I created, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mom is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swings was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same thing as always: the same tiamen work, 15 hours days, performed weekends, no repentance, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps not, does not exist with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I simply had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some might think:" "" "grasp you out, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you are doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher when you know the sums, and know how the sums feel when the sums stopped, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song listen to my heart, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "is a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mom, you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and second, she called me not "Shittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call any more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my sums, and here it changes all my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mum, you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic out of the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of summons, can't do anything but to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I created, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, juniors and the song in which it goes, or whatever the girl gets rid of "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy station comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workers' work, the Titanicummen, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are, if I say to you, who I am I am managing the programs and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not force and it is not specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are to be done, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I'll say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a firm rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice unless I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not ansatzweise so, how do you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer my workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man do rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are in the garden around, and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always feel after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! you always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me for naive, for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">They are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I am talking about my teenage daughter for all 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can lift 15 minutes on the piece, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes away!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children would have been finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my goodness, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is to feel the sums to feel a place for its soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" in general.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door, the energy goes in and I find me in my office again. I hear an unknown tune, she meets me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I use it in full swing and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>

<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful to that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's easy to me that I'm a Titan. I never saw a Titan Poker's journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-support healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor that attempts to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure, they have heard of one of the most famous one of the most famous, "deep-breaking stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to improve the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was Senior Consultant and worked on the emergency day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in the brain-Hirn-traumata the brain is attached and the skull pressure is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What can I do with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue are growing, comparable to small children who are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François abolished.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising, this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them at higher concentrations near the brain.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source, which allows the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells precisely, as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are looking for colourless to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the entrance examination of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in the prescribed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routes we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken back after a couple of weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we used an injury and implanted the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells help a monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual business task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feeding pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable dexterity level, we last in the motex Cortex of the motmotoric range.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkey were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then try to recover themselves with the help plastity brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys, who recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before infringement.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after irritation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest barriers are before you can start clinical trials involving human trials.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one needs to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you look forward to the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it's useful before you can offer this treatment each.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We are making a big mistake in the West, as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism does inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great night in Beijing have doubted that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is crawling with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I reintroduced Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our election -- did not affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unspeakable friends that would be repeated to me if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a truly and defensive democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are mensed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">For the issue of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few are known to recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of unused sparers and corporations, who could have been productive to invest there, where it could be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt hill, and also to produce all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twins summit, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the U.S., Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently, a low demand for protecting the pessimism of investors, who would not invest a low demand that would not be able to kill the prophecy that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances that lead him to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely dirty art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for rescue the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of social form, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy got too many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigner, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to impose the job value of athetic democracy because of these exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working arms, but it is not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial that they had the right to vote on political mitment to the same voting rights in question of stature.</seg>
<seg id="935">Although Athenian democracy has not kept long ago --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our modern liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But at Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthening the poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy was possible, and the democratic process was instituted, while the economy -- so the world of corporations - was a democratic revolution.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an untary struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually emigrated to politics and dismastered it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not have more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is obvious that you can still be in the government today, and yet not in power because the power of politics into the economy is discerated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of booting, which is so sustainably the animals of which it feeds, decimated, that they may be starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that strengthens the policy so far, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand, and the managing director of the corporations are anxious to invest cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism, the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the welfare of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't talk very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only regain a wonder as in the ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low noise employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation will be higher than the twin peaks, and the social conflicts deeply, as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must unite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we make the reunited area more democratic, otherwise we end in a disease surveillance Hyperautocracy which can appear in the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, so, whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is, whether capitalism is wrong by a dystopia, similar to those in "Star Trek," in machinery the people are serving, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it need to look like this "Star Trek" -such utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of enterprises: ask for a capital market before you're working and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income from capital and income originate and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein, and employees working there, but the company does not belong to those who work there. no exchange between capital and work, no great gaps between investment and Save, and ultimately no emporal twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trading deficit or trade surplus of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that, at that time, it wasn't the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, in particular, we have a reunited politics and economy in particular.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is the same time liberating, in which they are privileged persons preferred, and marxistically, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashback of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to ship in a "matrix" - similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian marxiest.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and that's why I'm also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most abyss is - the area of economy -- a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense if I must say the provocative, China today resembles Britain of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember - we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- it is an error, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China, resembles very much development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now want to do what the West has done in the 19th century, it smells of the hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>

<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this failure --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is true. unfortunately, the powers are within the euro zone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system that is not viable, by political will and authorizism in life, you may have to delay a while, but if the change occurs, he is abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, especially in such an appropriated situation, claiming that he did not make mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the cancellation programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money-legislature to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to carry out our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the publishers who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Due to Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision, which Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is introductory employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelatine and describes on Twitter as a "film, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, shows the shows and contents to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These shows shows such as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted, where, after one saw a season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not feel about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle expression, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and presents them online, where they can watch each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists for free things, do you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pauds, which parts you can skip or watch out again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to choose with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- as the average sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company, another manager has plazed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super-show and he also uses data for this, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than arrange a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows it etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four channels, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years in statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindeste, what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time in which we get more and more statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come with it in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If a man is in prison here and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not that a company does not know how multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">These data are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is estimated to predict them by data analysis of flu, the worse species, predictions -- through data analysis of Google researches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success was published in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data emerges in the decisions of life -- at work, in case of enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions on data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You need to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you can make this problem in his individual parts, so you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place you put the parts back together to get a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and open again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to meet the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, for what they could not have been able. but the decision to make all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they went a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas, than they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and that's not forgotten, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thanks to you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later see it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have met some choices in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by a little more sophisticated, like data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is at us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying, decisions make, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you so much.</seg>
