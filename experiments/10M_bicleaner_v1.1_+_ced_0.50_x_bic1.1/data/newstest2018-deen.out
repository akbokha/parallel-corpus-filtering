Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where people are going to meet young people .
a Gru@@ dge @-@ kap@@ elle , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small hus@@ band@@ men deal with the im@@ min@@ ent reason of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to do an exciting car because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a wra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , a quot@@ ation of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but is therefore very respon@@ sive .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then , as cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Mercury region has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r carpet , which is not recognis@@ able as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large tender map for cities and municipalities of detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; works for cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these arose according to the Bavarian Auth@@ orities administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey@@ ing Bay@@ erns .
their client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville in February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a wide @-@ wide Bayern map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Administration .
the State Journal of Munich is from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive for the national capital .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ send@@ ling , that appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was created 21 years after creating the map , so 1877 , in the Munich district .
today , under@@ line is in the middle of the city .
the houses of under@@ line are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zoom , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els there are no farmers there - but small gar@@ dener in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 was the venue of the October revolution , was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the primitive leaf@@ let one reads only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ pillar road , one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 , the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ th . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the facility - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he instructed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the old age .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circul@@ ator in the hair of 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
in 1920 , the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a school house with training .
west is the football pitch of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential homes from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built - in an architectural response to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ al , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as the &quot; main place , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies began in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day the pre @-@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station on April 5 , 2017 .
the old Munich @-@ card can be found with the aerial view of today &apos;s aerial photo - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights group publishes tourist warning for Missouri
the National Association to promote Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discrimin@@ ating policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which will come into force on August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based action cases occur in recent times throughout the state and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against crimin@@ ation , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state to exp@@ el the disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate group that follow the it@@ iner@@ ary , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights , the people pass .
they are being put together because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
in the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was accused of the police of Missouri by the police .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of Missouri , in which black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people must be willing , whether it should bring peace money or relatives to let them go through the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri was recorded in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the FBI secret program of FBI , which refers to the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to compl@@ ain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued by the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) , after the United States had committed immigration authorities to viol@@ ate people because of mig@@ rant workers .
it@@ war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU championships Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have found themselves a picture on site .
representatives of the Sch@@ wen@@ demann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann initially best@@ owed insights into his operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals cared for and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Black milk &quot; is responsible for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
at the table of the holidays only regional .
since he is also a BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot;
I can &apos;t act on der@@ art surfaces .
the green area of green spaces for a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ sense .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ demann stressed .
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and managed to control this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not perform bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the turn@@ out project and is glad about leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would need to be supported .
one hope that the capacity of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they continue to bring their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often seen in criticism
a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the dis@@ closure area is thus 40 hectares , which can not be opened up to at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus the farmers remaining 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat dec@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , no farmers and land@@ lady does not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Peter White stand firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape @-@ care system ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state of government f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pre@@ mise is the presence of a g@@ p@@ r drawn conveyor .
in addition , the un@@ f@@ ences area should not be bad ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the power .
for the fishing b@@ acher electric fence project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which want to build almost 16 kilometres of the fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s first stage at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideas of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN about the proposals for dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t stop the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of owners of owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would succeed him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the importance of being attributed to her , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ press : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which light@@ ens the world .
the poem , which you refer , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively right , but how it form@@ ulated itself , does not really go about history .
it is about contemporary response to the dead words of Lazarus , the only ones , in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; your troubles , your poor , / your oppressed masses , that desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ eventh waste of your rich coast . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; was better to see in our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to make her words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ cans by presenting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the association &apos;s connection with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change this far from the right wing .
the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atory that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not give the way to the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh pushed here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of view@@ point of perception .
the great phant@@ asy indeed of Lazarus was there to see them as they had seen from the exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it &apos;s true in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and this obviously does not want to recognize the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle re@@ members a time when only two Schot@@ t belonged to the Team from Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athl@@ ete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics Men : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type of road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah during E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle from the team to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was quite natural naturally , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver medals , who will compete at their fifth world championships with 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it &apos;s &quot; incredibly &quot; that 16 gravel in the British team are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the central route Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which is to be observed after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Doyle re@@ members her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team capit@@ als says that she is &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is so special to be team capit@@ als , that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me to be something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the gravel that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on poets .
what my speech is concerned as a capitalist ?
yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
therefore , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be just as a great atmosphere outside . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : don &apos;t work around a public office if you don &apos;t miss it from you .
the father of our country knew something of bad media .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles .
he chew@@ ed at the criticism , certainly .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction can be taken away - and , dum@@ b , and dum@@ b , as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted , which expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ es , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest vote of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as pri@@ cel@@ er@@ res to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ sty head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , blocking of persons appearing on the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially called and by employees that are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse had the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments nothing further than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ut or sp@@ amm@@ ing or h@@ ass@@ ous people who buy the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people , who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just true people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ icient .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ ert , but she asked after them .
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate that idea if a number of people taking part in the same subject , then they become perpet@@ rated by some more than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the staff of the govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; would others probably call &quot; princip@@ alities . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to access a message by simply blocking one critic or negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or burn prot@@ esters and to silence .
but this just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who is critici@@ zed by Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claim by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers promised between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat on his guidance .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington decisions .
petitions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Great Britain , its office , according to historical documents , collected by the George Washington Project &apos;s Online Pap@@ ers .
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
freedom of freedom , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses include the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of local comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who was in the past year , led links to the end of the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best page , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he laid this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great window for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I had won it from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour following his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ oned .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six rounds on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with one passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking at lung cancer .
scientists of the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer is attributable to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study on this issue in 1994 .
there are still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably able in time , &quot; says the head of the construction site Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the underground there is much ver@@ ce@@ able , which is not listed in the plans .
traffic , which is always hin@@ dered the construction work , represents a large problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ no@@ bility of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and bul@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the bus buses are entitled to pass .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working with the work on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite st@@ ress@@ ful .
but fortunately , we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land

in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai shel@@ ters in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Papua New Zealand , the house@@ wife is usually called a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen Kn@@ olle is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .

of course there may be too dangerous to work : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are difficult , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one has dar@@ ing around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua New , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote on the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who runs control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal notice of it .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided in Papua New and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is empty . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and out of cor@@ ru@@ gated cardboard ro@@ ofs , which were converted from r@@ ust into different yellow tones .
only very few Indon@@ esians made their journey here , sof@@ as journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was reduced to $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua population has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars worth .
however , these wealth are however , a source of mo@@ ist for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military personnel and units from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden gene and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
Mass@@ acre in Pap@@ u@@ as family @-@ high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ year @-@ old have been filed under the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone .

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ sun@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied , because pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim @-@ mig@@ rant workers are coming from the populated islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the rights ab@@ uses in Papua New Zealand .
the former Zimmermann secured a total of 29 districts of Papua New Zealand , including P@@ ani@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a depth of two months after Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off their tone and came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and stroke the group with their def@@ ences , spoke victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
one child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult , that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things were escal@@ ate on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field prior to the local police station and the Military Command Centre to challenge justice .
they wore crushed hunting bug@@ ging and led the orph@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ i@@ tive - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began dra@@ fting stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it un@@ released in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ oping danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows not yet who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the two soldiers .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries out like many Indon@@ esians only one name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers would only want to secure their station , because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people seem to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings were first filmed on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
in three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i was held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims and gay , the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua New Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately solved , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they began to talk almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke at Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , charged with the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Eastern Europe said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have been taught in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims took contrary to such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ly un@@ believers .
&quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai fear , to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the shooting houses did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police enjoyed the vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man who lived 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ essed in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
Auf@@ ger@@ eg@@ te vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers to re@@ acted out by re@@ war@@ ped warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who was near the hospital and was witness how the last one was delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to withdraw the involved officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ th@@ ru@@ d for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the native Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Zealand .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua New by spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to these thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; safegu@@ ard of national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is just as range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they reserve the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold out on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a co@@ ed only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua New and the new migrants have grown since the launch of new flight gro@@ oves at the Nab@@ al airport in larger numbers have arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually going to be the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua rare represent capital , or the necessary skills to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of P@@ ani@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , subject to reporting international media remain curious .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ ds and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Papua and Western documents : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the ind@@ on@@ esian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to prevent the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on site want to take more foreign governments to know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura came in silence and pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia 2019 has another presidential election , but the Papua say that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ok@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ nuts , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council .
he doesn &apos;t know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that , living under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ y military , is found in poor education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua New , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats of threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ani victims , the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never forget justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire found a fire on Friday in one of the highest resi@@ dences of the world in Dubai , forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story buildings flee .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high house in just two years , which one calls acci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a inhabitants whose name was George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) will cut the fire and ch@@ illed the building .
the government said she is working on provision of accommodations for the affected people .
the incident may re@@ lie@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ buildings around the world .
a study carried out by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 , revealed that the biggest part of the damages from disgu@@ ise , the out@@ fit for decoration or isolation , came out .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates to insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) is retired with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting of the Ho Chi Minh City , this sport @-@ Cup group was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles only on two win@@ ches , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact that often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic stay in the traditional competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nation@@ alities have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to back the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
you will continue to work to improve the rate .
even after the vote , after many attempts before the proposal , the proposal had already come to compens@@ ate the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to host the host &apos;s right next year .
in order to reduce the cost of organizers , the requirements in training places etc . facil@@ it@@ ates and the players will complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers , forbidden objects into the plane , find a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited objects in the control point of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration passed by , among them at least 6 percent , which stress the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally banned kni@@ fes or other objects with clin@@ ches .
less than 1 percent claimed that they would have been delayed , they would be delayed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the pol@@ l of more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules .
of those surveyed said they have tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were deliberately made to T@@ SA agents were food@@ stuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent agreed to have borne items by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirm that they were inten@@ tionally banned drugs to the aircraft .
the company said that travelers were questioned throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ d@@ ware would have been carried out by the airport and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people who are at most s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware - ignor@@ ance or unknow@@ ingly - through the safety , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ afe that liquids must carry them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited liquids .
for a period of time , people thought T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gy .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s clients to cancel Order
electric mill@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has already decided that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the triumph@@ ant numbers on sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla chief El@@ on Mus@@ k proposes a different , less gl@@ ancing number : the cancell@@ ations for the new mass market model 3 will be revealed for the first time .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had frequently applied to more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is beginning to start .
now Mus@@ k was a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations have been withdrawn from 6@@ 3.000 .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
for cancell@@ ations , Tesla pays off the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; complete .
at the present 45@@ ,000 such un@@ binding reservations should be found in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , if the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be the problem , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie with demand , but on the production side .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models are supposed to be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 , must be charged at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without any larger inter@@ rup@@ tions .
many experts have doubts that this is possible .
but if there comes to greater del@@ ays , then the in@@ ability of reservations could be used for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t hin@@ der satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves forward due to the execution of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency had proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
there is a deadline that ran out on October 1st for states to comply with the standards from 2015 for bottom @-@ floor zone o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have hes@@ itation to spend a year in order to study the plan to study the plan and to prevent the economic decisions in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent , more str@@ ingent environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block in@@ toxic@@ ations or to delay , to which the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels have resi@@ sted .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal back@@ set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regular wa@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to prevent the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks to delay .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn @-@ turn on o@@ zone is quite simply the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the States through the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under former administration , the EPA often did not keep the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited for the implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement concluded the date for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA noted that P@@ ru@@ itt will benefit his &quot; satisfaction to the delay and all the other legally available authority , &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the last month of approval , the implementation of the rules will be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led by the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our g@@ ages - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly exp@@ elled by Smo@@ g , &quot; said cutting der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sylv@@ ania , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals and other sources react to sunlight .
the clu@@ stering Smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists cul@@ minated about P@@ ru@@ itts with a surprising course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worried about how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the manager responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to attack environmental protection and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Walter Martin@@ i st@@ resses : &quot; it is a unique small od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ atory certificate : count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain to Tum@@ ble Church in Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the speech of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a splendid farm , which belonged to the Church or the patron saint and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was in addition to the Lower Village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the stunning settlement of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ walls these historical conditions .
Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right arose from the early medieval owner .
one Lord , who built a church built a church , and remained with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and could also forgive them .
so that was the right to send a priest , or to propose the bishop a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two zer@@ oes at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first discovered in 16@@ 92 , but later in the Second World War I had to be released in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were pushed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was in@@ dense .
in 1796 , French forces camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tur@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as final resting place for the dead from radio listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church was demolished .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half collapsed .
to prevent disaster , the tower was demolished .
only today still existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

club wants to check permission from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ave &quot; is not a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore changed to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ils ( CDU ) is asked to re@@ take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval from December 30 , 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy consumption for the rest of the city area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a few days earlier by a change of the flood control zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but they had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval of approval is illegal and therefore declined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council once again decided the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; an approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind energy systems were excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has entered the circle four weeks since a week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they are likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the administrative court on Thursday , the circle on Thursday did not want to take part in the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four more than 200 metres high .
last year , the company , which took part in the city of Vier@@ sen , was closed , p@@ olls with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households will be covered - this represents approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ grown households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , the fourth city set green light for buying three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cra@@ p together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ gel@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded for a fatal disease .
two other people were slightly hurt .
the state road stayed over hours .
according to police values , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her mother &apos;s passenger car with her 53 year old mother called the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and distributor plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ zi and people from the region should discover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the city authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping centre .
as Chairman of the Trade Union , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend is to awareness the customer , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity .

municipal authorities and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City Center . &quot;
these include new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with a selling Sunday , conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation .
there are also attractive offers on Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customers will also be able to restart customer potential or again .
these include courses and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city center with a look at the glance .
at the end , everyone should contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and one .
he sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that was partly wider , king in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , distributed that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities took part in the nationwide &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for appreciation of local trade and its meaning for the community of our cities stronger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under spring guidance of the I@@ HK and with many partners are also clear that each citizen can influence his direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump translated after tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US president Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President compl@@ ying him , because he had refused the Wall publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first An@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a split exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Ten@@ ump said Mr. Ten@@ ump said that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia , was ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; would be &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; settlement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he had said the gy@@ ms : &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle ages in a con@@ i@@ tive strike - took a long train to his cig@@ ar , looking at checking out the wind@@ shield .
inside shred@@ ded the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry of the silence , when a young black man was crushed by passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a p@@ ests were thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience were very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Mayor &apos;s right back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is unden@@ i@@ able that no one person was arrested in all these years - even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who assi@@ sts in the organization &apos;s organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Congress in Georgia and a life of civil society .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that it never has been corrected .
&quot; we want to en@@ forcement , we want to termin@@ ate , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must maintain justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;t get to cure and reconciliation until we maintain justice . &quot;
a beg@@ gar puts a beg@@ gar on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , which received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , people say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : Politics and Sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court ruled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their vote in the summer of their vote .
approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mers Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said that the rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester was sleeping with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby that she brought her not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when it was removed from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a complete between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in murders , and eliminated evidence of witnesses and identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , stra@@ pping , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist anymore in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with his ha@@ sten@@ ance in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and l@@ acked as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ yo since years , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room we tried the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ ends the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at loud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely there is the energy in space , a feeling of cam@@ er@@ ships replaces the un@@ ease .
everyone is busy doing this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once more .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non @-@ violent and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a tragedy , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and leads cheap holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street only .
they have almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as offensive moisture , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you find on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air felt like to be donated .
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead body .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they mur@@ m@@ bled a little boy , as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and wi@@ pe off her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ med Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ as .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his players , and then breaks in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; she whis@@ pers on women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience lives together with the actors for dinner together .
in a table , a white pair of Atlanta take over the reverse with a black pair , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski therefore fought to find words , which has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear those terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it do with me makes me think that the Lyn@@ n still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof holds the farm at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring , because it describes the terror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is to be condemned to repeat them . &quot;

great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat back to empty leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was expected to have been expected .
in 2013 he had to leave a hil@@ ly Pfei@@ f@@ Concert over himself , there were five years later great che@@ ers in which the for@@ ked &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown up with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its sight .
I draw a positive result .
max Quanti@@ ty works as Volun@@ te@@ er
they work in their volunteer year equal to several places .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked on the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come from ?
quantity : I have done SL@@ C .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I recognize myself for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
make a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is locally , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from aging to youth up to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ken .
it has always been another person who has a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee is whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - one needs to go individually .
very interesting .
and you had no touch @-@ anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but this is life .

in the case of un@@ approved local reports , however , three civilians died during the incident at the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violent to hit the Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bombar@@ d@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all the injured in a stable state and in the U.S. military hospital are treated at the airport B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dent that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a big concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide motor@@ om@@ be killing at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
on 31 May , an enormous bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US headed by force in 2001 .
violence highlights the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support military and police in the country .

EPA makes the decision to delay Smo@@ g @-@ Rule to Cl@@ ement
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the government regulation by Obama , under which the states are obliged to con@@ strain Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was carried out a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step@@ per .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ings 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment to the agency , collabor@@ ating with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be determined to establish where cuts must be made to prevent more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to raise a wide range of environmental impacts , imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which aims to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , which worry about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and increases respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
Communal Living Room wants to be shared room
at the end , the decision was clear : for two counter vote , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ds decided to establish the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement area .
in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
indeed , until now , until now , until the date of the church community , there is no planning for planning to travel from a private investor to the project .
there is a discussion regarding a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the con@@ greg@@ ations are bo@@ asted , such a common room not just as meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ tic living space , but open to the church .
as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
reconc@@ iled by means of funding for the current budget already in the past autumn , by means of funding .
construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be reported that T@@ j@@ aun@@ ts , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision is to sign@@ alize the investor that in this regard , there is no kno@@ cking between the legs , that is close to him in this respect - which is close to the environment - as well as pul@@ s@@ d@@ ach - as well as pulse height decreases and construc@@ ting the construction industry - it would be possible .
un@@ necessarily , so do not only mean Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition .
if it helps : he unanimously got the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela call points out to the many of its own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so wrong , you rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I am doing so hard to do so . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal stake .
it looks behind a covered sub@@ sidy to already registered or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface , you don &apos;t give an allow@@ ance , but get a real , in doubt in doubt , is the counter@@ point .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Application , who suffered decisions according to the decision , finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains with two anti@@ lock at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge ride back to our infrastructure . &quot;

walking in Star of Star to Star
in Har@@ z the national park will be first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ l . &quot;
this is planning the club observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the need of many har@@ vest@@ ers and was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , motion , and sporting performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ qu@@ ire from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brown position , su@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards are to be added to the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
the star@@ red train to Ride should be extended later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away .
also medi@@ ated , in which constellation is a chosen star , and when he is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , at the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal National Park , Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany in the middle of the national park .
often there are from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
since 2003 , there has been a similar similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , a similar similar to the planned star cluster - the planet &apos;s planet .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet track leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation of Equ@@ ation ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the panels with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the total distance of the planet is a good four @-@ kilometer distance .
while the light of sun is needed up to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star but would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia which should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ Office in Los Angeles , until Garcia the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council L@@ igh@@ tweight Champion , down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion .
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time are both fighter members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia was stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters &quot; would be the &quot; perfect order of order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; he remembered .
&quot; I went up to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to download light weight .
and he must move to lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and we are strug@@ gling .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give us this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted to agree .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate Group asked whether there must be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , a part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell following their lightweight titles in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked after him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia and pushed himself out later to fight on the network which offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .

it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Des@@ ire after T@@ ire Fer@@ ti@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the connection station market width is probably likely to be control over his vehicle .
the car dra@@ gged right into the ar@@ tery , where he beat himself and then lying on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were partly hurt in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured service , the A7 toward the north was closed for approximately one hour , then the traffic could be passed on the left @-@ left strip by accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defense information in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two opponents have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotary chain should also be optimized .
and a fool after a fre@@ igh@@ ty , the adv@@ ices will no longer be influenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better , even after the experience in preparation with the triple chain , than with the square chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is surely his cause , &quot; because we have just built up in the triple chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requirement is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ ious and we do not afford such a lot of game errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after an accident , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t want to know his trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start to the season I have only after six to eight days of play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken early due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e perhaps could be more fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a ascen@@ sion fav@@ ors in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland will go as a slight favorite on Sunday to the En@@ counter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are leaving them , only because we have the claim to come under the first six &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance was absolutely positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to strike in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Editor coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; an such statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( ri@@ ca@@ em@@ bank@@ note ) started with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) because of failure in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees , who were min@@ der@@ aged .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has now been sent and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ruled that the person might be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person might be &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is asked in question .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the study was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet the 5@@ 81 results found it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that they will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which are used in X @-@ rays of we@@ aker and MRI shots , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic@@ ist is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correct , a child as an adult .
the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are moving forward .
on Wednesday , seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , master builders at the department and traffic in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , work began at all three refurb@@ ishment of bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is stopped .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge from concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red cra@@ w@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has received a width of 1,@@ 30 metres wide and seven tonnes of heavy fraction .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as a factory way .
the southern part of the bridge is to be put on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge folder .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is said .
the particular thing about it is that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
a special finger@@ tip feel that requires the wiring of lines through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project by hand@@ held posts .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town , the street is in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of three bridge units are 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : in protest with German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties go on a beach but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , everything else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites the &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell .
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy Chief Executive Officer Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in front of the event at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D developers , but demonstrated .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , &quot; but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , was very happy : &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , who could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police has led many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is just a few metres from the venues .
what is the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the African volcan@@ os that he had to stri@@ ve for such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not available enough parking spaces .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ caster , a band responsible for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ an@@ ese Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers waiting for the general candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to hold their speeches .
the police remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can drain - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I bite the grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship between the Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately caused more bitter .
despite all of this , the brunette performer is based on the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve kept .
or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten gave Kri@@ sten to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived with du@@ alism and seriously believed .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
they have suffered particularly well , according to the &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school time , as they rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girl .
that really has hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live her love life : &quot; people expect you to make you a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some of them may call me as aw@@ ning , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to justify the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and much talk ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow , I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t pay the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes put on Forbes that he owns kohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and inherited a carbon business by his father .

in the meantime , the Republican National Committee announced on Thursday evening a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der ourselves to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 gover@@ ness and control of the least legal bodies in history , the announcement of governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and not able to find a positive , reas@@ oning message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ D pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian debt for d@@ oping scandal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of World Athletics World Championships that the union of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all the athletes who were shot at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the prohi@@ bitions that was posted in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the reporter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress pleased that the Russian Federation is aware that they have experienced some pretty hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia should accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress were made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to put Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always , that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the wi@@ de@@ ceased system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the World Athletics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
d@@ ope tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden Trainer are still free , he told Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral for Mali : min@@ ed soldiers
at a funeral in the North American Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people were killed in Mali with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Secretary of Defense , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) , said nothing .
they described the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice that they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old senior citizens from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday prior to a week in the West African Mali .
their mou@@ ths were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a mur@@ ky of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only members of the church was par@@ ting .
after that , the funeral celebration began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the sad@@ ness of the ro@@ ses settled , and the members were arm in arm of arms .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the cum@@ ber@@ ed soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and eng@@ aging .
the t@@ aup@@ t@@ mann took up the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regim@@ ent .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , the commander of the regim@@ ent , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali was not a Minister of Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not leave his wife next to his wife .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both .
the Queen would agree with the decision of her husband , it was said in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he was not the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Cri@@ ahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function which he wanted to look at his wife , not as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by said the leader of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he was not the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he enjoys the country for which he worked in the past 50 years .
the German @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the subject he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always triumph@@ ed in his almost 50 years with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ins , which I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco , and who had the reputation to be the brand of British intellectu@@ als , I could not hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier Weil wants rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from their country demand in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition led to the opposition to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP &apos;s opposition .
the former Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ire founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU freight leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to record them .
with this , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new landmark day will be elected to the 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could reg@@ ain a majority in this situation .
however , Stephan Weil keep it for indispensable that the country &apos;s day immediately decided to decide his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on its further notice on Tuesday .
the state cap@@ turing also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister will withdraw the trust of the Prime Minister and elec@@ ts a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these opportunities must be kept legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss any questions if they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the political leader himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a tra@@ jec@@ tor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ ins@@ ane de@@ pu@@ ties to return to their Land@@ tag@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect of course that she has received her country @-@ day , which has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the state leaders of a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ rough &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even in front of the background that there were no domestic differences , we cannot re@@ consider this step . &quot;
the SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survivors of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ west to CDU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook .
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the State tag quickly .
the Australian Open West will cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last em@@ it@@ el@@ iness and in their fru@@ stration their personal interests in front of the land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ spiel and tried to beat out of it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CDU freight leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to include El@@ ke T@@ west into the CDU .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag for the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ ash@@ ore , with personal career direct the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the CDU was in front of the SPD : strongest force , SPD and Green had a very thin majority in the country .
agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses over contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) became an interview with the German editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect consumers from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stress pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ ges .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , according to everything we currently know , a health threat is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis of crisis - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has shut off immediately and is located since announ@@ cing the victims of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers .
the trade has just like the manufacturer to worry , that the selling products are in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and health .
if in eggs the resi@@ dual content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time there are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , the production plants does not meet immediate debt .
rather , due to suspected illegal practices of service firms , they have to be reck@@ oned with economic damages .
as always , there is too little con@@ trol@@ le@@ ure in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or even on the slo@@ thful jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have uncovered the process .
however , to the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be exp@@ elled to 100 percent .
this is why a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ over to the State bar in the cases where crimes can be presented , of decisive importance .
I have already seen several times that I expect from the responsibility of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food items ?
consumer consumers have the right to get safe and transport food exclusively .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ tly judged .
by hanging resources , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ tici@@ des fi@@ xation il in the attitude of life @-@ safe animals is not acceptable , and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must consistently be lab@@ elled and lab@@ oured with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is po@@ uring and entic@@ ed .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ inhi@@ bited issues of European football matches , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona will not distur@@ b the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organisation , which monitors the European game , has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules , which have been called from the UEFA into life in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without any major loss .
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that is due to be ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G is able to loose the money with safety , making N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
associations may turn much money for the acquisition of players , but must contribute to the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following its election on the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in@@ ate when banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P dismissed from the concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - invested a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the crew and build a global mark - to a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to stri@@ ve to re@@ loc@@ u@@ sts from excessive editions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead , and we will surely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package of package , it can distribute the amount of the invoice about the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the funds will be issued for the next five years , amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it has been ordered that the team members are limited for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players will be limited .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to sur@@ pass their financial view by taking their income through companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ erer company could transp@@ ose the PS@@ G value , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would do not apply as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship &apos;s value was dis@@ pu@@ ffed by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments in N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments of the 2022 World Organisation in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be am@@ bass@@ adors to find out a great maneu@@ vers for UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be more attentive to consider any attempt to handle the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , the people familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they spoke to the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not be@@ fu@@ elled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than € 10 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ener by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that co @-@ financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play , because you can find different ways or different interests , if a country has such a major actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants supplier
in recent years , Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y Board chocolate is made for Swiss .
now the cooperation agreement stands before a possible end : the airline writes the mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline returns a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked all two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier of Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small rot@@ tle plates made up to 14 grams a year , the flight companion before landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to make any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ rant daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly , the advertising effect is : for a shr@@ ine manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants gives it to the new call , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion .
chocolate boards distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered up the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss led back two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
the customers of First Class with treats are spo@@ iled by the Con@@ feder@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gl@@ i , in the business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y .

as always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d who shows Matt D@@ illons of the &quot; singles &quot; whose ex @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old b@@ acker .
there are those moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this franchise like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I &apos;ll show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War &quot; The Americans , &quot; in the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West R@@ ul@@ ograph .
the comedy performed by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director gives to a folded TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who struggle for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main tro@@ ut - a hard ot@@ ten@@ ant Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to look at ( the police spend time to watch chess in television as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ man - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - cares for a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a killer that carries a Reagan mask is related to that it is often like a single play .
with six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or common enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is better to deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ Sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who are a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator did not go wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ ood .
blow to drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian m@@ afia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office was held on Friday .
between the ages of 25 and 77 , 15 years were arrested and arrest war@@ rants were issued against this arrest warrant .
in addition , the officers employed larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
two people were arrested at the same same Raz@@ or in Italy .
there were German arrest war@@ rants against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two will therefore be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , violent violent acts , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y .
already since summer 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s office was determined against organised drugs in the southern German room .
between the public authorities in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
so the big insert was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the investigations returned to the vis@@ ier of the investigations in particular Italian citizens with respect to the Italian m@@ afia .
even a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , in which early morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , is likely to go to the bonds of the gang .
ways to compl@@ ain great g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who cannot emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany have significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved errors in asylum procedures .
for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a review of a media report on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ cent@@ ric register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data could lead in asylum procedures and shifts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly serious mistakes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warning fashion in an analysis held in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people with foreign nationals are collected , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality is not good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become a German citizen and actually shouldn &apos;t appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ correct data input can considerably slow down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics on out@@ bound people , EU citizens are captured who would not have to travel .
but such false assign@@ ments led to a de@@ structive debate on how to deal with the trav@@ elo@@ qu@@ eries , &quot; says it in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to send refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is coming from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F conduct such procedure &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - following Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the grounds write the office : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity of families with min@@ der@@ aged children in Italy increases significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy released for inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ R ) does not hold this promise to sufficient .
other EU states would also return to refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political speech of the link survey in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threatened due to lack of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum System &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Human Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now divided over 50 litres of blood , now has over 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council will give multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous how our body is created for this , and we are giving respect to the don@@ ors which you provide blood for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood don@@ or helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Red Cross &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher told the actions that were carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ circular leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to theat@@ rical theater has led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Meta Schö@@ n , were awarded the multi@@ fac@@ eted blood don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 joint .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have reduced the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when it held interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected to continue the pressure on the budget , with inflation in the fall is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it signals that in the coming years , interest rate fluctu@@ ations would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may be expected to climb more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut Business Package , which was published before a year after Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time for the financial crisis , in order to provide budget financing for banks from the coming February , even though it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak since the pressure on the realm of households continue to consumption consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ line of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be necessary than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets today forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank however stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecast for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the most dis@@ appointing growth figures have reduced increasing expectations on a rate of interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months increased to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year .
the youngest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and low wage increases , as the mat@@ ur@@ ation is getting worse , before they improve then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the final decision of the Bank on interest rates , the call was increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision makers demanded an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation fell by 2.9 % in June last month , even though the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adv@@ ancing in relation to its goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the short return of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , as the credit lines are looking forward to businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should cause controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ Pre@@ ventive treatment from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse , pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk analysis by around 86 percent , now comes from health services via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court last year , under which N@@ HS had the powers to pay tribute to the EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced to HIV transmission in infection areas .
Pr@@ EP in front of the sexual intercourse means that enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who are registered in England and registered with a local doctor , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medications in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study is intended to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence as it is targeted in a large scale , taken and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; these great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades of persistent progress is one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Board of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome you very warm@@ ly this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , president of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be done quickly that the study is rapidly conducted throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of late delay and hes@@ itation implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this lifetime infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they contribute to the termination of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 by a major house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was scre@@ ened in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I love them in love and on this day an offer was made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet was completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; says she .
for this purpose she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet of high ceilings and a home not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the default .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were exagger@@ ated , without that we had to b@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us is looking down through the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
the gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatres , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror felt like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous smoke , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the fan of steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important so that when you push the door , very easily &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here it has managed to increase the floor space and use at the same time high @-@ quality materials that pro@@ cure the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and increased square meters from a little standard into something completely erotic .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property
two decades , there are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a conflict because of one of the greatest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a Villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business will be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - by Paul has described as &quot; main operators and the dominant personality &quot; in De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul , about one third .
a judicial file says that Colin property has a value of $ 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ pi@@ vot@@ al point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that of Colin proposed ass@@ essments have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affair in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday last Friday , the first court ruled by the Supreme Court ruling .
brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - out of which Colin , as Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early affair that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the battle .
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails , and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides made by the law firm .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants that operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early 1970s , a shop bought in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ k family .
Colin tells that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to pass on their own property .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis company group , with Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took up Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Father had not wanted to end Paul and I would like to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he still hope in a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps is planning a new Chief of Staff to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here &apos;s a piece by reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he represented a major issue in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that got into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would hit better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Di@@ agnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame cad@@ ence by monitor his meditation .
President Tr@@ umps relation goes back to television for decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV adver@@ tise is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended due to a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election team Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep track Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; controlled &quot; under control , is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these struggle agents do something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets without their interventions could have even more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff make it a few times , trouble from it , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently preventing it , that Tr@@ ump controversy is created .
part of the problem exists , that people in a white house , which are composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump materials that possibly promotes their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , president of strategic reasons of dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example written by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he turns out to find out where these originate from .
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of being at the White House .
although Johnson had been ban@@ ished because of ch@@ ic@@ ans from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence offered or revealed that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to manage a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
this un@@ changeable factors make the wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ unted crimin@@ als get Post of Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped .
the police went throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of selected heavy crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population hopes and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar from the winter .
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ atile on holiday destinations are hiding , whose name was Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have compiled 21 postcards for the crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ine , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands have come back with some escaped travelers in the foot , who have acted one of the congregation drawn ni@@ ben in order to rec@@ la@@ ims a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a weal@@ thy street from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s @-@ Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they were thrown out in May , without being s@@ uns@@ aved by the Council of gra@@ bs .
the tac@@ t@@ ling group found a gap in the defense of defense , and pressed its vehicles by a section called un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath , where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced through shame to the implementation in fact , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ eler were there in May , moved on and are back again .
more recently arrived last night , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my toge@@ ther@@ ness if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a local people who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller to be lo@@ oted only by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of the camp on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them as fast as possible .
in order to support our cover collection , it is very important that as many residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling them 101 .
this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambi@@ ence company company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , there were approximately 30 000 nights per year , and also proceeds through the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically rising figures of refugees who came into the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which ass@@ orted to controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and he already spoke of serious interested in the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ausen with Managing Director of Birgit Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there are already longer time construction container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renovation work is made .
the floors have been torn , bl@@ ank@@ ets are broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with big furnished showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything seemed to be &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer emerg@@ es .
&quot; we want to make a je@@ wel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you would not move to the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , st@@ resses Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms look wide , explains shi@@ vers more .
both individual tourists , groups or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already has led the scissors .
the ideas of the city be covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to define exactly .
under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the out@@ lines are also brought to fore@@ mann , which is already clearly visible .
a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Collec@@ tors Ass@@ ist Grand Jury
in the Russia affair , by US president Donald Tr@@ ump should be a special Grand Jury in Robert Mu@@ eller after a report .
on the last weeks , the panel recorded work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal with the cause of confi@@ ded people .
the newspaper adver@@ ts the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that there is already the first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is examined whether there were dis@@ agreements between Tr@@ umps Ele@@ ction Team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to appear in election campaign as consultants of the Republi@@ cans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller recorded a private and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kom@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally wrote into the centre and looking for the accus@@ ation , whether the president may have disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to check and decide evidence of evidence in possible crimes and decide whether the prosecution should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called the purchase chambers .
mostly they are switched on , if it is greater and controversial cases .
the procedure is always running behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to hearing ai@@ des under oath .
according to the broad@@ caster CNN , pre @-@ charges were issued , which turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , cad@@ umps and mother @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al election engineer Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in US television that show that Mu@@ eller isn &apos;t shy in his work and that he should be necessary if it should be necessary to take action fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be inev@@ it@@ ably called that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the onset of the committee in the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the demo@@ cr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
his Special Advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he know@@ eth nothing from the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but these work usually usually in secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures taken to work the work of the special medi@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not determined against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , whose name was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump had fired Com@@ ey .
because of these rings , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he would want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure .
after a presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special occasions and its employees .
this stimul@@ ates spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
unlike an independent special introduc@@ tory Congress , as reported in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and Democratic sen@@ ators were laid down on Thursday , after which the special issues could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West @-@ Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg is solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s .
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large col@@ oss now work to the north and will probably take two , three years until it is melted .
it is 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice@@ ants who have registered the researchers in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the crash of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , however , since about 30 years , there have been an unusual combination of ice @-@ sw@@ ings in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a background background .
according to many researchers , it could be related to global warming .
the broken Kol@@ oss had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s swim on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
so it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xes and departure from some years ago .
a complete mak@@ eover Offer be broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some things that even the lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s are in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present .
moreover , the ice plate stand under tension and could be crushed if there is a piece of key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on water and ice so much water , as it makes the melt even after the melt .
however , the loss of the sword is leading to the glacier directly into the sea , and much faster can be flowing as before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project writes in the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s is the fourth largest in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .
it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural thing and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the start of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be cont@@ ested , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l will be back again or in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ ding , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though this researcher did not lead to the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic Eis@@ berg to climate change , so in recent decades there were much ice cream of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in the past decades .
this long skir@@ ts of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline was contributed to decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have spent about three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ ame it to the areas where the temperature is the fastest sti@@ ff .
CDU wants to@@ dd@@ rate at the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy freely @-@ being , the CDU demands from the employers association to become more attractive .
shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has passed 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day behind .
the fac@@ ulty in the circle are obviously very desi@@ rable .
there were approximately 620 applications to be registered in this year .
nonetheless , the circle is still missing staff to cope with increased requirements and tasks .
currently , in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann , there are 50 un@@ occupied places .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would now want to join the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative , and to join the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover , not just short @-@ term requirements for professionals , but to make future @-@ proof of the application short@@ age , it says .
the overall concept should be orient@@ ated inside and orient@@ ate concrete measures for cross @-@ star@@ ters and include a training agreement , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one could not know previously .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a high number of employees , the disease or age of age , comes out of the service .
so high time for action , so that no longer stays un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , goes out with his party even more than the common application .
he had long been already in a cra@@ yon day for a f@@ eit@@ ful surprise when he posed the personnel cost of staff and the rest of the parties stag@@ gered .
people wants to be reviewed with all the possibilities that facilitate outlet from the municipal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here , the movement management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - a home tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Peop@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CDU , the staff and officials try to pay better than it is actually mandatory for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , Incre@@ ases or more money , if one changes in a higher level , which is based on vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO @-@ migrants life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has warned NGOs working to rescue the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they do not continue to continue their operations to new operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new behavior code , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized by the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ased &apos; because of their crew effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which is only in operation since one year , refused to express a detailed predi@@ sposition of the Italian citizenship Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can evaluate all charges which are currently being collected , after we collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ased &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , which has been monitored since October .
it is thought that its crew members will be delivered directly on board , which can be delivered directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , so that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive them , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to over@@ take over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of code , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officers , who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs working on search and rescue sets are currently ready to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable if they don &apos;t have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates @-@ Organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i has now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , has decreased in recent weeks that efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan coastal Guard and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan civil leaders in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin outer posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the Northern Alps to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and At@@ trac@@ tions .
there are three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out as a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and whale @-@ test of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome charge .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
they followed view@@ points , partly on towers , which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest and the pre @-@ bearing pl@@ ains .
in between , there were always longer an@@ sti@@ ege for the long tri@@ vi@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , viewing point at look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ or@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate arri@@ vals .

console instead of grass - Bundesliga covers for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars before computer consol@@ es , instead of strug@@ gling with wind and weather to fight over the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ r@@ ens ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a growing industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
these also known the first federal lig@@ aver@@ ist , which increasingly engage in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs in this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first &quot; interactive Club World Cup , &quot; which play the gam@@ ers of different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile used an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and , the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you could be present far more often on these markets , than only once in the year the Federal Republic to Asia .
what is it about ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup FIFA are made out of competition .
long ago , as in ordinary sports , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the 2022 Asia , E @-@ Sport is part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- School in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is Com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which is also found in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it need cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise in the console , but also exercise their body and respect the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is getting more about a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult through online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classic Sports .
scientists emphas@@ ising the high integ@@ rative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte , and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) , says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and great tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
the soccer league is less than 2.4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer distant from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
International are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the US , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez will participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

even in Europe , some things do .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ y .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer @-@ first liga @-@ associations are obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , pushing Conrad Roy to suicide , condem@@ ns
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and sentenced to five years on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced to his life in June because of a dre@@ ad@@ ful killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to appeal to the vocation .
she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives went to argue that both of them and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
clothed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured Bl@@ use , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions were killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the court attorney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no repent@@ ance . &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that her &quot; old or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even her spirits have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said it was &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son .
I want to be proud of me , and how I am proud of me . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said they will be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; I will never be able to attend the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not this only person to have been together since my birth , is a pain that I always kept for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a true preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to themselves after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging up , spring of a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent to his death during two weeks before his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything you need to do is to enter the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted for murder on their British fellow worker in Italy before she was acquitted of two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comments : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me at the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ usses the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there is no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel New to see , he made himself hur@@ ried to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the insert would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the miracle of the coach could also suggest something like this .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in youth players , Deb@@ üt@@ ants and just out of the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he .
you would like to treat sugar@@ l , best to those , to whom you want to keep a lot .
those who have been spo@@ res to compete with L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s legacy , can only use a small extra @-@ motivation only good .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you like to do : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old worked as a Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
to the right , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did their rest .
and at all , Kim@@ mir worked in this starting formation as the one that can take the ru@@ d@@ der on the right hand .
he gave instructions , tried to sink the un@@ inserted tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal thus , to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , at the devil , come out on the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( fol@@ ly also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
that was fol@@ ly quite well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the ri@@ f@@ le , both ag@@ itated sovereign .
the Nami@@ bian n@@ oli was very difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried to get a few times in the play @-@ up .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave the fact that the result was &quot; not so , as we have hoped it . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play shift , speed change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ familiar this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , gave not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me passed after a few cris@@ p declar@@ ations in his back his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here now I &apos;ve already noticed .
in Bavaria you must simply win any game . &quot;
nevertheless he does not have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : Economy pra@@ ises Tempo
the relationship between the country and the regional economy often proved to be an Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V en@@ quiry from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ els at the same time the old female ministry .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ dom attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the greatest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure politics : the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now .
this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure to 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West &apos;s centre of Trier , which is located in the v@@ ord@@ able requirements of the federal traffic plan .
the aim of taking the route in December 2020 is said : Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) has been stimul@@ ated in the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend in the Super@@ markets for ten years .
moreover , I have an open ear for people who want to establish a company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is an additional inc@@ entive for young apprentices in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the excellent master examination and 2500 Euro , when graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road structure could be quick facts , at the same time , the land at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the chief executive leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to change the Wis@@ dom at the Land operation so far only 29 positions are occupied .
the I@@ HK requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CDU faction Vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf illustrates this on the calculations of the host of the host , the country investment in 2017 and 2018 , less than 20 million euros , less than proposed by country roads .
Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is further the previous Broad@@ band building in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the supply of supply in an I@@ HK survey of 3,4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ economic minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers confron@@ ts itself with an anti@@ re@@ action .
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itted diesel engines , apply as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles explo@@ si@@ zing exhaust gases , also take to what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indicted to ignore the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ old devices that could regulate emissions if a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from the United States and could be set up in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to handle a system to handle emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could develop Volkswagen hard : the luxury car manufacturer is over @-@ proportional to Volkswagen to win .

&quot; the happ@@ ier day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the 60s of the 60s , with the release of his Carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artists of cities were inspired .

lav@@ ender from Provence on climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to drought remin@@ ded conditions and due to illness @-@ borne insects , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective for the past years , because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past few years , and in the fall much more .
this has impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small zoo , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf of the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ res not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and weak@@ ened either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ver@@ aging from the ground , but also testing the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat to Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually met on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two senior journalists discuss what feels secure : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : ad@@ versaries , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters , names for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug ad@@ den@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto held its office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there were at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latter is her publisher and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply advised , even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the faç@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the Thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that show his ridicul@@ ous face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special exec@@ utions was built in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders , who are linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ derer of journalists are only rarely set before judgment .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , even though the ground is still more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we miss all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on Val@@ dez &apos;s theme there is nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extradition for the United States in January , Zin@@ alo@@ a was become one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of fat@@ ted , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ een for drug winds , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only one Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal a@@ at with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs commercial routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may be off@@ ended the sons , suspected ga@@ members bought every copy of the output , once they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the arrest of another newspaper , which had published the same history , leaving the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was working as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honour@@ able reporting , and the turnover and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it , hard working examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else had to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect repor@@ ters for his courage at the persecution of Mexican drug history , where they also led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a , is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October last October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do so many ! why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was able to curse the friend , gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar against the office , go and sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for a routine ?
his death also has forced her to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions on how they can do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ maintaining .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the cause with Javier happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ ages , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days earlier became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were the governor themselves as not trusted .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drugs bound de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce left on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the State issues focused on the home town of the Governor .
and there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months ago , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source .
&quot; sooner we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; due to its slim body .
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , devoted to the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ au@@ ts a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration on a further journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become more sophisticated by journalists in organised protests , &quot; SOS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone into Washington and is trying to collect international support for Justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of squee@@ zing journalists and kill them , because they said the truth .

Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , involved in government officials and an equality society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists by police officers and officials .

dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to retreat his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying one .
now researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been received so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his ch@@ uck@@ ling skin was surrounded by red@@ dish , and they said they had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report published in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the killed dinosau@@ rs that has ever been found , and one of the world &apos;s best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ maintained state has researchers , who &quot; really remarkable &quot; as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant fres@@ co@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met on something which seemed to be surrounded by the surrounding rocks , decided to look closer .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy Earth cl@@ amps .
after all this hard work , the ready @-@ ready result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main gate Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ riere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a wall of tanks , probably was threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the highly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ or , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique , which is also used as counter@@ im@@ bur@@ sement , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to retreat his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old Cre@@ ature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technici@@ an Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preser@@ vation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments across his body .
they discovered the con@@ ciliation , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the con@@ ciliation is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs have been hun@@ ted by meat with carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , that evolution of confron@@ tation of confron@@ tation as a means of survival was favourable .
but most contemporary animals that use the con@@ ges@@ tions - do you think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , highly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ r carni@@ vo@@ res must have been &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his con@@ ser@@ fourth dar@@ ling to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at this time Alberta was as warm as south @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ serving skin but also available in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use fantasy to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little with the eyes Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ oden , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the dinosau@@ rs dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of its fur@@ ious ancestors .
it belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ped in the mud .
the creation was found by Shawn Funk , when he was at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the survi@@ ving dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips taken from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant carni@@ vo@@ res was melted through Western Canada , until a flooded river it was flooded with the open sea .
but the underwater bur@@ sement of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin tre@@ ads still cover up @-@ pri@@ ot tank panels along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , this is such a level of preser@@ vation so &apos; rarely as a profit in lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will .
rest@@ less remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank panels which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed to the top .
I can count the sheds on his sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday night at the A8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass nails .
there are numerous injured , kilometres long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the late Thursday afternoon , some 20 people were injured at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich highway ( A8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police were against 5@@ pm between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm , just under 30 cars , including trucks , inter@@ mitt@@ ent trucks .
there are no data about the exact number of injured persons .
it was light up to moderate injuries , and a police pre@@ acher said .
a large lifting of life @-@ vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
a total of ten kilometres was formed in the direction of Munich .
as an AZ reporter reported , it was also on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous genes .
the fire brig@@ ade secured the label mark of the vehicle , which now have to be made with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thereby it was a coll@@ ision between a car car and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is twi@@ sted in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
from the work@@ flow , the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes up the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control .
but times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most smart ticket control .
it is simply corro@@ bor@@ ated by mobile , that one should be taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test line runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , far we are out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the next year on many other correspondence routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway ticket for the ticket .
in order to use the use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what do you need to do most of the passengers already .
it is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : it is rising in the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
the test clients will then be a button to the electronic resolution .
the train companion will receive a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes the train conductor at number Y at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already available online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - what is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without a ticket control by our train team , check out the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management of DB correspondence .
second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those often rides , know that in addition to late @-@ late and ver@@ pas@@ sten turns the ticket checks are among the biggest troubles .
for often , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers do not need any documents in any case you need to find online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result are endless discussions between train att@@ endant and riders , which leads to poor atmosphere in the part or big room and del@@ ays at the end of the time , and the Schaff@@ ner takes care of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also available on the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to study the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post of somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and still there is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused when nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has always been ret@@ ched on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; he thought Fer@@ rell thought .
but death was for them and their community nothing new .
she laid her mobile phone in order to twe@@ ets later in the evening on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns Father , who led a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed at which a polic@@ eman was in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ent dog .
in another video , she said , assured a different polic@@ eman , and he cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we may call typical . &quot;
in that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went on the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on would be driving .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and resistance force that consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , following F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they discussed the two a conversation , which they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and see it and re@@ tu@@ cked at it .
it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we have to do to free us to free ourselves .
even though I have good luck to give you an experience , in which she personally did not experience a lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a poor service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , as the activists waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets and helped them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after August 9th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organis@@ ing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who are born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt Ins@@ ulation .
his commitment to Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on fer@@ ti@@ lls - to show that there is a &quot; Messiah &quot; movement , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls live how she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain amount of injury during this work and in human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls is the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of movement , who have influenced the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting constantly on various fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , even though it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continues .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration .
she describes the social political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she sounded against a singing and she is committed to this memory , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Meg@@ a@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss a bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although they are still not built yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone has out@@ dated the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while they say one to the Bit Gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need any man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mag@@ ician ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , the remaining businesses will profit , fear the opponents that the pedestrian prec@@ ep@@ ts are bleeding .
additionally , the gallery is planned on the property , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct marketing its products offer .
with the beginning of the construction work , it will conclude .
the gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farms market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the estate is always happy again .
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for our but@@ cher .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping waste in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , footwear , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores have been empty here - some have since months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important to us at least the market hall remains .
because after all , the goods offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ tru@@ sive .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger firms , as the dor@@ m r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit after Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market arena located during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will actually come out sometime .
or is it possible to drive the song bit @-@ gallery earlier , to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but there is no more space for a pe@@ asant @-@ market with many - how I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost infinite - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ fts and Haar@@ lem , which were sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analyst had sent a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly accepted diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and Dis@@ claim@@ er , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created the DNA analysis of DNA from Mann@@ ing and the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp , even if something intellectual comment could not only be created with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Bradley Edward , but has already been talking about identification as a woman , has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is inten@@ tionally sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and has been associated with a plat@@ e@@ blonde hair - which she was associated with her .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in this , the artist portraits of foreigners produced from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and chew@@ ing gum , extracted from the garbage to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed . therefore , they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use have been made to un@@ equal b@@ rie@@ ff@@ ing , who ex@@ chan@@ ted several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ating comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would be a future fore@@ seen in which the President Chel@@ anting Jud@@ gment would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was just a few days after the book has been released , Mann@@ ing would release his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy promises .
there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter approaches to fix the rigid divisions , which he actually should fix it further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with their superior signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic confusion , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we all are .
&quot; what people hopefully will take away is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an office is a page from the above mentioned comic novel@@ ty .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she shows up with a free acqu@@ itt@@ al in the hand of the disciplines of the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never keep the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist that greet you from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still looking to see if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing had not seen the exhibition yet - as it was supposed to do it in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of space by the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ical simulation , which f@@ ests itself as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ ri@@ ties were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that were also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the Oxford University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide crowd hunting is on @-@ way for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been searching for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , arrest war@@ rants were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the National Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed after several styles .
a new warning system was published by the Chicago police authority that the bodies had been discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still expl@@ aining the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been excluded from the Campus of North@@ western University &apos;s campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Ju@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanting to join himself .
Chief Communications Officer at the Police Administration of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he challenge the suspect to susp@@ end the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which has just received a mysterious hint that has just happened in the apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident happened on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic pre@@ mise . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; the Russian Vi@@ cin@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ cin@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ timet@@ able has been updated in this respect , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ replacement R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything to concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the investigation by the WA@@ DA approved investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to be alleged to publicly accept government @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not admit what exists . &quot;
Mut@@ ual words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales station R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has been excluded as part of the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .
she called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to provide surveys , speci@@ als and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ suite to handle and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City launch @-@ up G@@ lint , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ rett said she had a better insight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with G@@ lint .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows the most complaints and which managers have low cost results - allowing you to drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture we have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee describes a blog post , which have been sentenced to those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lint , this wish is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business option .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognise , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lint , Conver@@ ting Company leaves tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys to watch confi@@ dential answers in real @-@ time and view the warmth @-@ card of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , which can report well @-@ known behavior .
and when the chief executive board is related , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is badly handled or eth@@ ically beha@@ ved , it can experience co@@ stly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , employee floods and pl@@ agues , Quin@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ tible , there can be problems that were previously seen by senior executives , who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unknown practition@@ ers can be identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 degree perspective into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in the employment disp@@ utes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to accept eth@@ ics , values and employees @-@ commitment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quin@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to her right , &quot; that company recognised that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online .
&quot; before use of technology for monitoring of eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lint and Conver@@ cent also offer your software as a service , and do the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , which supports both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his overall funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given to the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff expect more than ever more than before .
in competitive markets such as silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
people want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worth to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience for Link@@ ed@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise third @-@ promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data about the staff @-@ commitment according to experts of the workplace culture important .
but the data is us@@ eless , if the company &apos;s ste@@ wards do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks people to your feedback , it may have a expectation that changes on the way is .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come quickly , or not at all , it can motiv@@ ate them and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ er International , who has seen the company that has left too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and if you don &apos;t worry , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now performs monthly employee surveys now , was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lint , so is Er@@ rett .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to recon@@ struct several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights into the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it is possible at 23 o &apos;clock , as well as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers on a side of the new exercise fields in the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this un@@ touched minutes a lunch break .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer courses are returning to their final inspection before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water man football center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it actually has extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three lessons of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players full @-@ packed time races .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the fraction moved almost one week after the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , during the summer school during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood exercises practical exercises .
you will stop 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the control change of N@@ CAA support even if they add a further point to the number of routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just push it , they plac@@ ements further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish their practices , as soon as the camp is finished , which was subject to the clear state of its fields by a neighbouring car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already a protective network behind a door@@ step , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a saw that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far taken to think that people would rent a room and then set up there to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video footage of one exercise , it is quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t make too big wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with cont@@ actor monitoring of third parties and their results below the original contribution then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible counterfeit detection and they may be displaying results of the fact testing of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believe that they also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if they do not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly eliminate .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a review of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fact @-@ reviewed third parties , people want to meet more context in order to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues its feature to &quot; test &quot; in conjunction with the article &quot; and working on other changes in his news feed to decrease false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years a si@@ p@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the wat@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for an graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a predi@@ le@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look upon the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it &apos;s not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agents in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters still smell smoke , because then it was kind@@ led a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would be even though .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England , and nearly four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I &apos;ve got my welcome drink a little over &quot; ) it seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ stro@@ kes on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ing , gar@@ dening , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive , which he told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , it was described in the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , which represent what had said : &quot; you could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go everything ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the wider base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who re@@ built the newly built castle to join the farms of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant began in this field and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patented that the family Dar@@ rell was seven years long during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , depicted in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell originating from the 18th century , which produced his own funeral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later , when his s@@ coff@@ in was dug up ) .
the perform@@ ers are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; men seemed to be true g@@ aun@@ er , always spend debts and money for things , which they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ Men delete their education crises by giving rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences
he has brought a two week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ em@@ än@@ n@@ ki , the grounds of a San@@ at@@ ori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .

with the opening of the 301 years old Mari@@ an in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign on Friday their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
still until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team wanted to hold Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan .
at the end of August , it is expected to be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we are very well aware of the beauty and attraction of our city . &quot;
in action , it is more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , meaning it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a true promise , one that gives the city a distinctive basic feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount will cost the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost her new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es more than pension funds and transport .
this is how this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , under the chair@@ manship of the government now also took the five vibration relief as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians were in the y@@ as in the past .
the government is moving the bre@@ eder in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed cou@@ p , head of Staff Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ing .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who should have been involved in Putin &apos;s coup , is negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has the army really handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ rav@@ ages in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among other things in the lift of the head@@ tu@@ b@@ ade for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large @-@ cle@@ ann@@ ess at the army and security forces will move on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 state operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times , they were calling on appeal to their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
according to his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the power of the military step by step , not last under calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted specifically an Islam@@ ization of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a particularly well @-@ called officer , who sought out political asylum after putting persecution from persecution against persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets this , it could not let the Nato rise cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , there are doubts about the Alliance for the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operations abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , more str@@ ingent regulations for issu@@ ing visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and save $ billion for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the USA the way to change the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to help themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited from the American media .
Ministry intends to renov@@ ate track for racing circuits
over the past few months , over the past few months , we had fought over the future of Renn@@ sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is expected to go quickly .
even before the end of the year , the tourist route is scheduled to be built on which the tourist route is going to be built .
in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the race @-@ up @-@ long term , according to data by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , construction work will start at the track again this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ racing , the country is particularly important for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared road secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the over@@ sight of the circuit applied to approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country took 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis is to be ordered in the future from the country , will definitely be coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen train as an operator have already entered the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the timet@@ able , the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that would be a regular race shuttle to be ordered separately on December 2017 .
the race @-@ way shuttle is one of the most popular railway connections between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ enh@@ g .
in the past months , during a pilot operation we have been tested whether the circuit of sufficient many people will be used to order it again in the future .
the route is also resi@@ li@@ ent in parts .
the ascen@@ sion of Sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be back in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its form of ni@@ p@@ ples and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun over them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said with the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone , which feels warm , with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs , and select everything , from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is more worried as many robots have to possess the &quot; personalities &quot; which would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern sex dolls have developed into robots using a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they can be appealing , for example .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which medi@@ ates the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its m@@ oods during the day - just like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ lined female properties that goes on rape if you go a step onto Fri@@ gi@@ d ( says here : resi@@ dual ) Far@@ rah goes , wor@@ ries one of the most .
based on his website is true True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a Vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish , or just another sex toys .
her emergence and her increasing refin@@ ement indicate something dar@@ ker and ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of the gender equality of the sexes : to a desire to have sex with sub@@ du@@ it as an optional addition .
most of course , most of course don &apos;t have sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices her rising popularity , they still remain in the mar@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood of consumer culture .
but what was le@@ ak out of the boundary , can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives permission to them .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ ashing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time that the women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which the White House is a pre@@ sidents who st@@ owed to have women sexually attacked .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swallowed body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision appears .
Gilead &apos;s Republic is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their peas want that they feel human , they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robot does not represent real women .
you cannot separate or go away from their companion .
they have no placement or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything which could distur@@ b the imagination of total differences .
expressed differently : they are fake slave .
or to express it in the Rede@@ emer from 2017 : maids
does Tr@@ umps Work ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human being
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become one of the cad@@ ence of the cad@@ ence era that pol@@ ari@@ zation , which have polarized US voters as well as families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and the harvest , there was newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ sel@@ ectable relations .
we ass@@ ert ourselves all of us to burst out our filter bubbles .
less not@@ ices the power of Tr@@ umps , families have been carried out .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ hand Di@@ chter@@ in who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , which has visited me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with whom it had fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his m@@ itt@@ ens will not get lost at any day .
however , there is still a long @-@ dry long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of den@@ ial .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ancient version of the crazy version - the dog on the car model , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement could occur ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild beam .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans be only spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Kar@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you do not need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cy@@ linders - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turn out to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ atic music medi@@ ates this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage , the subject @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year old , a 11 year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s , and all have a great time .
if I was able to evaluate the kar@@ us@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked after that .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before leaving my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the evaluation by a 15 % tip to the same - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but exer@@ ted pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation that is not required .
the poor woman in the department store was inde@@ bt@@ ful , while I tired the experience to submit their credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain re@@ located in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of shr@@ ine to his hand joints , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his prison cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal of the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of the day 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to put the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell on the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , who they say it was too dense .
the prosecution authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa in the Supreme Court , and the claim could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us works danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what do you need to know now
how exactly is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group are offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emission behaviour of the emission classes of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine by ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that che@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their upgra@@ ding has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a full implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write each of the victims .
if it is due to an inspection , this will be done in their context .
how long does the change@@ over have to move altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anine means .
the hang@@ s from the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers do not deal with the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would suggest , such as S@@ met@@ anine .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where drivers are threatening .
in rural space there will be no value losses for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale yet .

we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the next year .
the job is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work makes it still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time wondered , so far the application has no application to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
so - under evidence of regular intervals - still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ jection authority , the applicant has to prove appropriate connections .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they don &apos;t fill this anymore , the citizens would have to travel to the Offen@@ burg by Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is important to the city and it is important to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , who reported from a good operating climate as well as good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the office of more than 30 years , some important projects have gathered for the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city lively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building site and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are available on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ door parking lot around .
the wooden bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ san@@ itation is still subject to issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ack@@ ers estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
age @-@ age is present for a town car@@ et@@ aker .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dening could be re@@ acted to vers@@ atility .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces will be comm@@ end@@ ously mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for that , &quot; when newly built , &quot; st@@ resses the separ@@ ating urban development master .
the town master carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of supervision and coordination he can count on long@@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
even though his successor remains for long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker , should be able to illustr@@ ate the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with the architecture of architecture , and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law .

bike on pipes have been cast off : ground @-@ track
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had been thrown off the blue bike of the train exchange rates in the Le@@ ob@@ ese road ( B@@ 116 ) on the pipes .
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ring freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male leaders and seek them for the night hours after them .
close to the crime scene there were witnesses a ros@@ y roller and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a number of Laus@@ bu@@ ck , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one or the perpet@@ rators brought himself in great danger , and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the complex as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ al of train customers could also be added to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic could be run through disabilities without disabilities .
almost ten people went out Friday morning , two of which were concerned about correspondence .
goods had not dropped out , however , they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( Fl@@ amm@@ ate Dar@@ mer@@ disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tion system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases could appear .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the affected people , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han also contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ines make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , which are able to destroy inflammation , are balanced out of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue .
when equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um incl@@ ines too far towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments have been noted that a kind of tolerance to promote immune cell in mice , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammatory bo@@ ard@@ eus , if the same system can work with people .
the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immun@@ cell that resulted in tolerance as they found that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been separately accommod@@ ated , this was not .
it presum@@ ed that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal Tra@@ ct .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice were lacking in mice , but were missing in mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not have any intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria decided on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and led to small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ating cells .
as an active component of the liquid was cleaned , it turned out as a side product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism that is known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i are developing such as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound description of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed by the old role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and was just 45 minutes to improve Mour@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mour@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as Mour@@ in@@ ho formula for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mour@@ in@@ ho hasn &apos;t wanted three more comm@@ end@@ ings , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four major comm@@ end@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if she had four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of an Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of an Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of an Dream@@ lin@@ ers was too .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such ads earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new descent for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind revol@@ ves around : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still speaking of the SPD , the Democ@@ rat Prime Minister was still strug@@ gling with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stor@@ my from the party centre , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important desire of the electoral fighting .
since Martin Schulz takes the party , fundament@@ ally fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year , with counter@@ wind would not have been described in the approach .
it was deep advice .
and one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can &apos;t be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green M@@ EPs led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the country election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
Michael Kell@@ ner &apos;s Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner requested the ab@@ yss @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ west to return her mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the dial .
El@@ ke T@@ sar must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign in the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ s a SPD electoral fighting , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ Message ship reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ Midwest for the CDU without its own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no longer , cal@@ med the comra@@ de s@@ ails .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then also - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party .
the comra@@ des in the weeks after that , comra@@ des in the weeks later .
then , when she had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next descent .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landmark , lost his Nim@@ bus for the weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in the crisis communication , pretty much everything was wrong , what one can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the supervisory board of the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister have already been in criticism for a long term .
mi@@ esis modifications were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just because , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to settle acc@@ ents in the covenant .
comra@@ des of the former mayor of Hanover , Hanover , its power in Berlin , was not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz as well .
they let him give him , because they spoke of a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
since then , Weil meets the party &apos;s internal power supply is not guilty of guilt .
and Schulz already won &apos;t .
sometimes , the comra@@ des therefore stri@@ ve to keep its own ranks .
their wrath focuses on the green , and above all on the gra@@ ci@@ ble par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democra@@ tically , such as Mrs. T@@ owns their own career events on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ sar is not because of its person as a direct candidate , but above the state list of the Dutch Green Party elected to Parliament , thus the Lower Saxony Member States continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate in front of four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil for the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career star@@ ters with a future CDU in the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there was more or any further comm@@ it@@ ments of the CDU Niedersachsen .
funding for local units III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Stadt@@ trend informed on Wednesday in sens@@ ing .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler returned once again a review of the events .
since 1991 it has been in sensation for rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the San@@ ge area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
at the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement still amounted to 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , and not only close new construction areas .
on April 4 , Karlsruhe is provided by the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe for information that it will be a sanctions area III .
the total amount received 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest from the church sensation .
how is a san@@ ction area now ?
you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role , whether in the planned area , at all , interests of existing interests .
if necessary , the local borders could also move again .
the jet@@ ty represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federation @-@ Länder program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in whose framework the sanctions would be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal towns , improving the residential and working conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would object @-@ related , which means per property .
finally , the san@@ itation area should finally be established as a stat@@ ute .
the grants period for funding has been running until April 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the inventory will only be carried out , within the scope of those participating in the san@@ itation area to fill up a questionnaire .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision should be made , so that the next year we can begin with the sanctions .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality had to perform the discussed pre @-@ investigation research .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban@@ isation of urban@@ isation , and decide when it is re@@ plen@@ ished and in what extent .
it will also be registered for the respective property also a san@@ ction ver@@ mer@@ k in the base book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make themselves a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , an important success factor for the project was the participation of the participation .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and foundation arch , &quot; which is among other things around the structural condition and the rehabilitation prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential arch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory ar@@ c &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill out when commercial premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
new construction measures are also not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of the convey@@ ors according to the &quot; wind@@ dog principle &quot; work - who first comes first , gr@@ ates first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outskirts II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to get a manual movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he will open his door @-@ door to his office and even run his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and poin@@ ter and now offers service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .

the wh@@ aling costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that would raise the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ er according to the data of the military that were left to TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president is on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was built in Connecticut besides a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because there is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the deputy head of the naval officer for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long , until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original plane crash occurred during the event at the helicopter , while security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the records presented out of the TIM@@ E was not clear whether a second flight would eventually be necessary .
at Brands Act , the Bundes@@ ange@@ stellte , state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked whether it was a violation of the Brands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander responded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and propag@@ ated efforts to ins@@ ulate the government regulations .
the use of aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into an investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign v@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ r services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made by American workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Assistant Press@@ es@@ ec@@ re@@ uth of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to ab@@ stain U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event attracted by the training needs of flight policy for the month , an official said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not responsible for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to ex@@ ert the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D revenue rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the flight list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of the helicopter is far below the rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs incur@@ red in the annual means . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , sales rates for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former press pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , used the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things which will be made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I think that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been working ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , adequ@@ ately empha@@ sized . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter when he entered his circuit over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man cars .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and talked to the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participants from the 1st of September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are allocated to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed as a seven @-@ eng@@ ul@@ tuous institutions - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger integrated , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children are to help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
these continu@@ ity was important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the Kit@@ a @-@ rooms - so far as the job of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm to improve the kitchen and foreign delivery to the city as well as the cost of the city as the most economical city , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 divi@@ ding forces will be re@@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational field not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the company , including women , play a role , the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan announced on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the official leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are in the Council &apos;s elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible , if women are unable to participate and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial government and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban published threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tilities among an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be given to power peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afghan independence Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie at managers of the long @-@ term commitment to produce production in its plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company held through the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; be the first to be experienced if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ al manager asked G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on &quot; concerns to express that the financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines would not be powered . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Duffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win any clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of ra@@ cross , affecting our members .
generations of families have been working here and the workforce focus on the local community and the large region of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a thri@@ ving production performance at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at Toll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with employees that we operate like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business is constantly going - and this applies to all our business divisions and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ er location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ cross as production facilities and completely . should our operations at the location will change , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regret
Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having given an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release cl@@ ause , but they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record .
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside the Catal@@ ans , although a source close to Catal@@ ans insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 .
but has been warned of the PS@@ G President three years ago in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they &apos;re going to touch one of our players , then we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players at itself , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have exceeded this line , the Spanish club was interested in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly made that they would not allow it to the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost their price for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the abuse of abuse is pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ ed scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ate , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication opposite the Deutsche Press Agency , he anticipated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ orship Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ bos@@ sed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , a ap@@ ology .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own sub@@ missions or their then false ass@@ essments of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; by contrast , critic@@ ised that in the reporting on violence among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measured at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; to be punished , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; you would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a folded fres@@ cos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be finished with friends as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the En@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ bility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it means Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ ize , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
even during high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also fail .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite the violence of even positive memories with him . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report of the Miss@@ ing scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ man , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one lift , many students take out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , he also appears as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , who became the Ö@@ f@@ teren , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz made no top performance .
how do you use this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ man : when you are doing the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask themselves , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
they are just eight pages dedicated and it will be clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of mid@@ or or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the acts of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere sphere .
one can prevent him , out of which too late , or first impression is not taken seriously .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all those surveyed - so literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so also , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; loved , &quot; &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; the guys regularly served with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always &quot; of grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which led to wound cavi@@ ties .
that he did not only hin@@ dered only with chairs and threw the key to the ground , but also ear@@ ne@@ sting boys in the hair or ears , he himself has been given up for years , deeply regre@@ t@@ ated and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
however , at its honour@@ able time , however , such educational methods in the fra@@ grant period , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also have seen this in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and non@@ violent acts on the pre@@ school , are the un@@ question@@ able bag@@ at@@ ella .
then one wonders whether it does not seem to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just threw on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understood him are still eager .
but the truth is : the report shows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the context of the report , the report was reported much about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be put into the final report by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in terms of sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ man : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted with the dom@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ man : a question@@ able student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... not a case in which he had expected ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had the correct findings and would have had the perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... b@@ ben en@@ et@@ rable or clear@@ er , or even rather opened , than opposite their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ors , confidence , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus , the report to the very clear result : &quot; that it could not be confirmed in the run @-@ up students and / or their environment , as part of the investigation could not be confirmed . &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to talk about any participation .
so it can not be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of having a look at the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
must he live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ man : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mil@@ let from sexual abuse and non@@ violent acts and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
yet exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the school and high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violent acts as well as we say once , other pre@@ cubes .
furthermore , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , which was also known for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ vi@@ liz@@ ers were regul@@ ates and were horri@@ fied and were horri@@ fied , all of them suffered at school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to reign .
but with those he had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on that way , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ man : there was no discipline there , but there is no sa@@ vi@@ di@@ st violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estimated to estimate the overall humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite the violence of even positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at the most time the accus@@ ation still remains away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he was straight to establish itself , and from its predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the conditions consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ man : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ r@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this point it indicates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exam@@ ining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press meetings , he recommended an urgent move .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity , as a test pen@@ alties , had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows of us .
it was also hard to estimate for him where the victims were exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permissible border was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he would have looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 , the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate the past today &apos;s moral measurement .
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s boards , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be opened .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to dis@@ miss@@ al and punishment , i.e. ear @-@ cerem@@ onies , and ears to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then it has been forbidden , he is also strictly prohibited .
what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger has George R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of exam@@ ining this subject also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s going to be about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedi@@ kts XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t miss that he was a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said once : without these perfection , without asking un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of World trans@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not have a big singer and no big singer and before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self sur@@ passing .
what kind of people you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with their book ?
Michael Hes@@ man : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well met again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , profound and hear@@ ty people who cannot imagine that he could do only a fly something else .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still alive today , 23 years after its embar@@ king , regularly contact to him , please visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive Him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ rows are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fore@@ ter@@ restrial teacher - a str@@ ingent Father , certainly , that may be - but still a lovely resp@@ ect@@ son , to whom they still have to look and love her .
and please , once more clearly : all that one thro@@ ws him are educational methods , which were then on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most odd , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ cer@@ ely .
there is the bad intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , is reli@@ eved him .
now the bond settlement would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and maybe even Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen to be at least in peace .
