<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where people are going to meet young people.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Grudge-kapelle, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small husbandmen deal with the imminent reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to do an exciting car because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a wrapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, a quotation of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but is therefore very responsive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, as cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Mercury region has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickr carpet, which is not recognisable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "in the large tender map for cities and municipalities of detailed maps, so-called" "" "Urals," "", "works for cities and municipalities." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These arose according to the Bavarian Authorities administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lunéville in February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a wide-wide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian State Administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The State Journal of Munich is from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive for the national capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, that appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was created 21 years after creating the map, so 1877, in the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, underline is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of underline are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zoom, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "uranium" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels there are no farmers there - but small gardener in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 was the venue of the October revolution, was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the primitive leaflet one reads only the street name" "" "at Gasteig" "" "in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen." "" "but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerpillar road, one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt was created "At the Auer Lüth."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - the psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the purchase of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he instructed the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the old age.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circulator in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 1920, the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and went into a school house with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of TSV Munich East, east of residential homes from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built - in an architectural response to the origin of the Irrenal, which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as the "main place," the Kaufingerroad was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies began in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pit-kapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where this day the pre-breaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn station on April 5, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-card can be found with the aerial view of today's aerial photo - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes tourist warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote Farming has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discriminating policies and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which will come into force on August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and missourians, as a number of fragile, racial-based action cases occur in recent times throughout the state and here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against crimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state to expel the disproportionate group that follow the itinerary, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights, the people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are being put together because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the beginning of the year, Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was accused of the police of Missouri by the police.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "the people must be willing, whether it should bring peace money or relatives to let them go through the State." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was recorded in the year 2015 100 Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the FBI secret program of FBI, which refers to the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) were issued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), after the United States had committed immigration authorities to violate people because of migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Itwarnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU championships Peter White and Kordula Kovac have found themselves a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Schwendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially bestowed insights into his operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals cared for and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black milk" is responsible for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holidays only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he described the electric fence project as "elementary important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't act on derart surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area of green spaces for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and managed to control this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not perform bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the turnout project and is glad about leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would need to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the capacity of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they continue to bring their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often seen in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which can not be opened up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remaining 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat decn.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, no farmers and landlady does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also Peter White stand firm:" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape-care system (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state of government fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Premise is the presence of a gpr drawn conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the unfences area should not be bad (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the power.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher electric fence project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build almost 16 kilometres of the fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is, when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the downfall of Saddam Hussein's first stage at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideas of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't stop the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of owners of owners and Liberty-Imitators would succeed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the importance of being attributed to her, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta impress: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively right, but how it formulated itself, does not really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary response to the dead words of Lazarus, the only ones, in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor: "your troubles, your poor, / your oppressed masses, that desire to breathe freely, / the eleventh waste of your rich coast."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh waste" was better to see in our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to make her words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republicans by presenting the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association's connection with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change this far from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty, but rather an early Neoconservatory that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not give the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh pushed here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasy indeed of Lazarus was there to see them as they had seen from the exhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's true in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this obviously does not want to recognize the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schott belonged to the Team from Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops," and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics Men: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type of road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah during Eiliie Doyle from the team to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie was quite natural naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver medals, who will compete at their fifth world championships with 400 m hurdles, says that it's "incredibly" that 16 gravel in the British team are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The central route Muir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which is to be observed after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitals says that she is "enormously proud" to the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "that is so special to be team capitals, that it was chosen by the other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me to be something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the gravel that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on poets.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will be just as a great atmosphere outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: don't work around a public office if you don't miss it from you.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad media.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chewed at the criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "the reproduction can be taken away - and, dumb, and dumb, as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted, which expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivoles, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest vote of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as pricelerres to connect with his voters and play his hasty head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of persons appearing on the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially called and by employees that are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse had the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments nothing further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trout or spamming or hassous people who buy the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people, who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just true people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not proficient.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer's Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hassert, but she asked after them.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate that idea if a number of people taking part in the same subject, then they become perpetrated by some more than a so-called collective action and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the governors as "concentrated spam attack," would others probably call "principalities."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to access a message by simply blocking one critic or negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or burn protesters and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, who is criticized by Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaim by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County is the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she named a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers promised between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters beat on his guidance.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with Great Britain, its office, according to historical documents, collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of freedom, opinion of opinion and discourses include the basis of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="432">2018 - all models are supposed to be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who today ordered a "Model 3" in the second half of 2018, must be charged at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never in practice tested production lines without any larger interruptions.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts have doubts that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="449">On Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turn-turn on ozone is quite simply the readiness of EPA to co-operation with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under former administration, the EPA often did not keep the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the implementation of activists and others, and in an agreement concluded the date for the implementation," said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also accept the law and authority that gives us, seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA noted that Pruitt will benefit his "satisfaction to the delay and all the other legally available authority," to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the last month of approval, the implementation of the rules will be delayed by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been set up in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilaire-Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm on a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilaire-plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique small od."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembürgatory certificate: count Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain to Tumble Church in Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the speech of the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church, there was also a splendid farm, which belonged to the Church or the patron saint and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was in addition to the Lower Village and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the outskirts of Tumors, the "mountain" of the third, the stunning settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underwalls these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">Patronatsright arose from the early medieval owner.</seg>
<seg id="477">One Lord, who built a church built a church, and remained with a priest, remained the owner of this church, and could also forgive them.</seg>
<seg id="478">So that was the right to send a priest, or to propose the bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were there in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two zeroes at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was first discovered in 1692, but later in the Second World War I had to be released in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the window plates were pushed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was indense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French forces camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Turlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as final resting place for the dead from radio listening.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery extended and the Hilariuschurch was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent disaster, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today still existing turmzwerg remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffner pensioners" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilaire-plant.</seg>

<seg id="497">The program starts at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump, including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he represented a major issue in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that got into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would hit better choices if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame cadence by monitor his meditation.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relation goes back to television for decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV advertise is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if the Trump was offended due to a fair coverage, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of jobs" "" "said the former election team Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep track Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been "controlled" under control, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these struggle agents do something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets without their interventions could have even more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff make it a few times, trouble from it, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing it, that Trump controversy is created.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem exists, that people in a white house, which are composed of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump materials that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, president of strategic reasons of doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he turns out to find out where these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of being at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banished because of chicans from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence offered or revealed that he has expressed false allegations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to manage a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large coloss now work to the north and will probably take two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest iceants who have registered the researchers in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the crash of the ice, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, since about 30 years, there have been an unusual combination of ice-swings in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss had so far been a part of the Larsen-C Schelcows.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelongs swim on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">So it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelcows lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the equilibrium of waxes and departure from some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete makeover Offer be broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some things that even the larsen-C Schelcows are in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate stand under tension and could be crushed if there is a piece of key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelcows and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on water and ice so much water, as it makes the melt even after the melt.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the sword is leading to the glacier directly into the sea, and much faster can be flowing as before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project writes in the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C Schelongs Larsen-C-Schelongs is the fourth largest in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural thing and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice plate is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most extensive retreat since the start of records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists be contested, whether the Larsen-C Schelcowl will be back again or in the long term, and possibly coinciding, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not lead to the demolition of this gigantic Eisberg to climate change, so in recent decades there were much ice cream of Antarctic Peninsula in the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirts of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to drought reminded conditions and due to illness-borne insects, causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective for the past years, because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past few years, and in the fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zoo, a microbacterium, the dwarf of the dwarf, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil lores not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and weakened either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Among the solutions that are considered considered, a better water distribution and the slowdown of veraging from the ground, but also testing the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually met on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two senior journalists discuss what feels secure: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: adversaries, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug addeners, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto held its office in December 2012. 589 standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there were at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her Inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply advised, even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice" on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the Thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts that show his ridiculous face with glasses or his typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, her nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special executions was built in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, who are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderer of journalists are only rarely set before judgment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, even though the ground is still more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we miss all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on Valdez's theme there is nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition for the United States in January, Zinaloa was become one of the most bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of fatted, two-story mausoleen for drug winds, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only one Kartell has control over the coastal aat with its valuable harbours and drugs commercial routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may be offended the sons, suspected gamembers bought every copy of the output, once they have been delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the arrest of another newspaper, which had published the same history, leaving the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encounter the dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honourable reporting, and the turnover and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard working examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else had to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect reporters for his courage at the persecution of Mexican drug history, where they also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa, is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do so many! why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was able to curse the friend, generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, go and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced her to ask her own assumptions on how they can do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home start and runways" to move drugs. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censored and self-maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the cause with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smugages, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff met by Riodoce on security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days earlier became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of policemen who were the governor themselves as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drugs bound de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce left on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the State issues focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, among them one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "was escaped a military attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"sooner we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" due to its slim body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers, devoted to the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez schnauts a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration on a further journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become more sophisticated by journalists in organised protests, "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez is gone into Washington and is trying to collect international support for Justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of squeezing journalists and kill them, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that she is again divided by the government because she is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime, involved in government officials and an equality society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" has more than half of the attacks on journalists by police officers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "you die in Mexico because they want you to hold the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a horrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgetting the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones besides their seperated head.</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report published in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the killed dinosaurs that has ever been found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant frescoes is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something which seemed to be surrounded by the surrounding rocks, decided to look closer.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy Earth clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready-ready result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main gate Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosauriere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found out that this plant-fresser, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a wall of tanks, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The highly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predator, and used a parachuting technique, which is also used as counterimbursement, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to retreat his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old Creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments across his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conciliation, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the conciliation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs have been hunted by meat with carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution of confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival was favourable.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the congestions - do you think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, highly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been" said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conserfourth darling to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as south-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the dinosaurs dinosaurs was hunted from some of its furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">It belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and mumped in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the surviving dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips.</seg>

<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips taken from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant carnivores was melted through Western Canada, until a flooded river it was flooded with the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="2004">The test clients will then be a button to the electronic resolution.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companion will receive a message that Fahrgast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor at number Y at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already available online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silent, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - what is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel without a ticket control by our train team, check out the DB Navigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, marketing management of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "" "" "" "" and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often rides, know that in addition to late-late and verpassten turns the ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of the co-travelers do not need any documents in any case you need to find online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing, or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train attendant and riders, which leads to poor atmosphere in the part or big room and delays at the end of the time, and the Schaffner takes care of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to study the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post of somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police has just killed an 18 year old child, and still there is still on the street," "" "named it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she joined Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has always been retched on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," he thought Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for them and their community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She laid her mobile phone in order to tweets later in the evening on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns Father, who led a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed at which a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellent dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, assured a different policeman, and he cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "he remembered her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"it is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we may call typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two next morning to Ferguson would be driving.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and resistance force that consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, following Ferguson, they discussed the two a conversation, which they had countless times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and see it and retucked at it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we have to do to free us to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have good luck to give you an experience, in which she personally did not experience a latant racism, it is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a poor service to keep them far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, as the activists waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism has changed after August 9th," "" "she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who are born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around Todestrakt Insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment to Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on fertills - to show that there is a "Messiah" movement, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells live how she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be a certain amount of injury during this work and in human beings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of movement, who have influenced the film" "" "BlacklivesMatter" "" "in the social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting constantly on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insisted that "this is not an affirm type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continues.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">However, she sounded against a singing and she is committed to this memory, since she went to Ferguson in three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love one another and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "Megaahn": TV readers discuss a bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although they are still not built yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone has outdated the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while they say one to the Bit Gallery:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "don't need any man" "" "(Siggi Bing) or simply:" "" "magician!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates that a gallery will attract more customers into the city, the remaining businesses will profit, fear the opponents that the pedestrian precepts are bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Additionally, the gallery is planned on the property, on which the farmers market stands, in which 13 direct marketing its products offer.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, it will conclude.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farms market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the estate is always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also have discovered the butcher for our butcher.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "this should probably be very low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping waste in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, footwear, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shop stores have been empty here - some have since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important to us at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is obtrusive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores are rented in a shopping center only from larger firms, as the dorm rents are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit after Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmers market arena located during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will actually come out sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible to drive the song bit-gallery earlier, to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no more space for a peasant-market with many - how I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost infinite - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tufts and Haarlem, which were sent from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst had sent a 35-year sentence after having publicly accepted diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and Disclaimer, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created the DNA analysis of DNA from Manning and the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could look like a sharp, even if something intellectual comment could not only be created with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about identification as a woman, has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is intentionally sitting on a driver's seat and has been associated with a plateblonde hair - which she was associated with her.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of foreigners produced from forensic artifacts such as cigars and chewing gum, extracted from the garbage to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed. therefore, they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse have been made to unequal brieffing, who exchanted several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrating comic "Suppressed Images," which would be a future foreseen in which the President Chelanting Judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was just a few days after the book has been released, Manning would release his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy promises.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter approaches to fix the rigid divisions, which he actually should fix it further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen to happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Manning with their superior signature, among them (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic confusion, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological respect, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an office is a page from the above mentioned comic novelty.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she shows up with a free acquittal in the hand of the disciplines of the United States as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they chill your words, they have won." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never keep the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture we have to stay, so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since then a former employee describes a blog post, which have been sentenced to those who have spoken is punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business option.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognise, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Converting Company leaves tailor-made "Puls-" surveys to watch confidential answers in real-time and view the warmth-card of your problem.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which can report well-known behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive board is related, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulations," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that his staff is badly handled or ethically behaved, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee floods and plagues, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail to the company's headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convertible, there can be problems that were previously seen by senior executives, who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unknown practitioners can be identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree perspective into the experience with employment," said Vitrano that leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and" "" "" "" and we protect our shareholders in the employment disputes. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to accept ethics, values and employees-commitment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke out due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "Social Media" came to her right, "that company recognised that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before use of technology for monitoring of ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent also offer your software as a service, and do the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, which supports both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his overall funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given to the connected nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's staff expect more than ever more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">People want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to feel in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worth to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience for LinkedIn, which is used both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools promise third-promise, commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data about the staff-commitment according to experts of the workplace culture important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless, if the company's stewards do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks people to your feedback, it may have a expectation that changes on the way is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come quickly, or not at all, it can motivate them and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the Business Management company Koter International, who has seen the company that has left too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow employees," "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">And if you don't worry, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys now, was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so is Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting the feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reconstruct several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights into the staff, and it hopes that in a long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-he years a siphole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the watl River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for an graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look upon the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years," "" "he says wedge." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It's not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agents in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters still smell smoke, because then it was kindled a fire because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as it would be even though.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England, and nearly four months lived in a castle ("To be honest: I've got my welcome drink a little over") it seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monstrokes on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardening, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received the full access in 2006, when the last heibin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">"" "when Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees began to take care of the archive, which he told" "" "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" "" "Oh, it was described in the attic." ""</seg>

<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go everything! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the wider base in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who rebuilt the newly built castle to join the farms of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a riot that occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly family of Kent and Sussex'," "" "Rhodes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patented that the family Darrell was seven years long during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', depicted in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell originating from the 18th century, which produced his own funeral, filled a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only years later, when his scoffin was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The performers are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "men seemed to be true gauner, always spend debts and money for things, which they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-Men delete their education crises by giving rich old women - I imagine it as a heap of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write-experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elemännki, the grounds of a Sanatoriums from the early 20th century, which has since been returned from nature again.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be back in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its form of nipples and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are fun over them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more frequently," "" "Mr Sharkey said with the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners with a silicone, which feels warm, with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs, and select everything, from the eye-color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to type or the colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is more worried as many robots have to possess the "personalities" which would look like a stepford-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they can be appealing, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" which mediates the impression of relapness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods during the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlined female properties that goes on rape if you go a step onto Frigid (says here: residual) Farrah goes, worries one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Based on his website is true True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a Vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex robots are not just a fetish, or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and her increasing refinement indicate something darker and tieferes in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of the gender equality of the sexes: to a desire to have sex with subduit as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most of course, most of course don't have sex robots, and while the FRR notices her rising popularity, they still remain in the marvelihood of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what was leak out of the boundary, can be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">Many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlashing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time that the women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which the White House is a presidents who stowed to have women sexually attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of the healthy human being</seg>
<seg id="2426">"" "" "" "it has become one of the cadence of the cadence era that polarization, which have polarized US voters as well as families in small format." ""</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and the harvest, there was newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump-selectable relations.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We assert ourselves all of us to burst out our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices the power of Trumps, families have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-hand Dichterin who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, which has visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, with whom it had fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his mittens will not get lost at any day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-dry long-time scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitome of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ancient version of the crazy version - the dog on the car model, which saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement could occur) - both compared to Trump in fact a very mild beam.</seg>

<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karousel is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year old, a 11 year-old and two women in the 40-s, and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I was able to evaluate the karussel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked after that.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before leaving my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option, the evaluation by a 15% tip to the same - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but exerted pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation that is not required.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases could appear.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causes stomach cramps and paralysis, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the affected people, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan also contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestines make sure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to destroy inflammation, are balanced out of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When equilibrium inclines too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been noted that a kind of tolerance to promote immune cell in mice, which carry a particular bacterium in its initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory boardeus, if the same system can work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immuncell that resulted in tolerance as they found that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separately accommodated, this was not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbial of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal Tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice were lacking in mice, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterilous environment so that they did not have any intestinal microbiome, and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria decided on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and led to small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerating cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As an active component of the liquid was cleaned, it turned out as a side product of the tryptophan-metabolism that is known as the idol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan have halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri are developing such as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain did not leave the persecution of Neymar after having given an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record.</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.</seg>

<seg id="2875">PSG clearly made that they would not allow it to the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost their price for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "" "" Domspatzen report "" "" Pope brother Georg Ratzinger "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abuse of abuse is pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missed scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenate, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication opposite the Deutsche Press Agency, he anticipated by the former Regensorship Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the embossed Pope Benedict XVI, a apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret about their own submissions or their then false assessments of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "by contrast, criticised that in the reporting on violence among the" "" "two measures" "" "measured at the Domspatzen plant." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the handles in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be "shameful and shameful deeds" to be punished, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "you would like to go to the church and that's a folded frescos."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, they pointed out that in their youth," "" "would have been a normal pedagogical means" "", "to be finished with friends as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "says the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was presented by the Enistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" "" "with high plaubility" "" "victims of overprint, 67" "" "sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it means Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarize, so that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even during high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also fail.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite the violence of even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report of the Missing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesman, the 440-page report on the "incidents of nonviolence at the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one lift, many students take out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, he also appears as Choleriker and Perfection, who became the Öfteren, if a Domspatz made no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesman: when you are doing the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask themselves, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">They are just eight pages dedicated and it will be clearly acquitted of any suspicion of midor or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The acts of violence at the preschool took place outside of its sphere sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can prevent him, out of which too late, or first impression is not taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all those surveyed - so literally - "redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent witness, "" loved, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understandable, "the guys regularly served with cakes, cookies and bonbons and" always "of grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which led to wound cavities.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only hindered only with chairs and threw the key to the ground, but also earnesting boys in the hair or ears, he himself has been given up for years, deeply regretated and apologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, at its honourable time, however, such educational methods in the fragrant period, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have seen this in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and nonviolent acts on the preschool, are the unquestionable bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then one wonders whether it does not seem to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just threw on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understood him are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report shows Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report, the report was reported much about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Georg Ratzinger will also be put into the final report by Georg Ratzinger in terms of sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesman: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted with the domellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to speak to my father or my mother," "" "I said," "" "I said," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even parents and siblings, certainly not a choral director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesman: a questionable student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... not a case in which he had expected (Georg Ratzinger) would have had the correct findings and would have had the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... bben enetrable or clearer, or even rather opened, than opposite their parents, internators, confidence, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus, the report to the very clear result: "that it could not be confirmed in the run-up students and / or their environment, as part of the investigation could not be confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to talk about any participation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it can not be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicted crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "nonviolent" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">Georg Ratzinger was accused of having a look at the previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesman: that's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge millet from sexual abuse and nonviolent acts and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Yet exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the school and high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolent acts as well as we say once, other precubes.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report incidents from the time since 1945, which was also known for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of savilizers were regulates and were horrified and were horrified, all of them suffered at school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states have to reign.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those he had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that way, like most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesman: there was no discipline there, but there is no savidist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimated to estimate the overall humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite the violence of even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most time the accusation still remains away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he was straight to establish itself, and from its predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the conditions consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesman: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domratzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this point it indicates that" "" "in the pre-school" "" "the examining" "" "will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press meetings, he recommended an urgent move.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity, as a test penalties, had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also hard to estimate for him where the victims were exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallout of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate the past today's moral measurement.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's boards, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be opened.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to dismissal and punishment, i.e. ear-ceremonies, and ears to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then it has been forbidden, he is also strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburger has George Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examining this subject also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's going to be about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedikts XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't miss that he was a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without these perfection, without asking unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of World transg, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and bonbons alone, you do not have a big singer and no big singer and before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self surpassing.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger in talks with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesman: through the work on the book and beyond, I've really met Georg Ratzinger really well met again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, profound and hearty people who cannot imagine that he could do only a fly something else.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domsparrows are still alive today, 23 years after its embarking, regularly contact to him, please visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive Him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domrows are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, foreterrestrial teacher - a stringent Father, certainly, that may be - but still a lovely respectson, to whom they still have to look and love her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one throws him are educational methods, which were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most odd, a man, only because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a medial sincerely.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the bad intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, is relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the bond settlement would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired large merits and without the outside of Bayerns and maybe even Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen to be at least in peace.</seg>
