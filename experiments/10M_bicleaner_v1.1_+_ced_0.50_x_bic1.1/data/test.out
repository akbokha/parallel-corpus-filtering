he never wanted to participate in any type of meditation .

Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into dra@@ wers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this , the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ mistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still stuck in dra@@ wers or get stuck from the outside label which with me and reality mostly have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather be@@ ating to me . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the best way , the actress brings her time at home , prepared TV with lo@@ cker@@ le dam and Mexican food , it &apos;s in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the Weiß@@ gl@@ ut they bring the question after the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all@@ ot@@ ching mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ sight .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered her holiday evening , they hun@@ ted in the quick gal@@ lop home to the feeding .
one kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the horse career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left himself with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not swear to photo .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid passed the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to sympath@@ etic athletes .
Federal Tu@@ eb@@ ony , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he did the prize money of 25.000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the second &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of Fame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the notes include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ ighting Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the leader of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hands of hands Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports cars came to Aachen on Saturday .
following the official part , the lively Society emigrated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the large animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - we want to both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential targets are due to the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
this , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate the economy , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claimed tr@@ ump .
he will drive regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton said against it : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
that is why the tax would increase for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
to be inv@@ ests , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ equal .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly denied by the nation@@ alist Te@@ en wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so , on tr@@ ump , there may be parties involved in internal discussions .
clear@@ er are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal extraction in the US again .
oil promotion should also be possible to exp@@ orting the territory by the Paris Climate Agreement .
Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies with their investment program , and urges : &quot; one country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the gli@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the U.S. do not want to is@@ olate the international trade , but just protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , Clinton said .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what if you want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , tr@@ ump who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and the citizen wants to boost growth .
his critics follow him , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the rich man wants to pay more tax , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has gained experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby , which is most a year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he looks curious in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ red on the tabl@@ etop .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid workshops in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized countries for all@@ ud@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and Munich &apos;s women aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - not as a visitor .
the exception is an wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted , because they would have torture or death , or because their families will send them as a hope of hope to Europe , &quot; she tells her .
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced , honor , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run this continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ g@@ boat calls for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they come to Germany , er@@ r , tells us .
even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ ous and ab@@ sten@@ ed in case of serious ab@@ norm@@ alities .
it is estimated that around 90 percent of women living in the Munich housing are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the awakening , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not need to help , I need more accommodation for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they w@@ ishing from a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is something in the governments of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press operators of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , sub@@ - and middle @-@ fran@@ ken factories there are only for single women and their children only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published by the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or become women and women together , it can become - for@@ mid@@ - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much women feel the need of this protection , one can read it on the And@@ rang , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since moving around , we have been talking about that we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists strike : demands for new work measures
deputy members of the Assi@@ sten@@ c@@ aries have called for their union to appro@@ ve new workers with their disp@@ utes within a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work measures in early September .
the J@@ DC said that it was ministers to ab@@ stain the concerns about the contract .
in July about the re@@ jection of a contract , Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and media studies have agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract , which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted against elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had been &quot; be@@ harsh quiet &quot; to problems , which caused that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract , and requested official new negotiations for all of your wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to en@@ rol a running program , which starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led to assistance that assi@@ sts reported six times in the history of N@@ HS in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to election of the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , who still took place before the vote through 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ ologists and media studies , with that the treaty should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for physicians would be first introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ plated Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot defend me of int@@ ru@@ ction that Ankara will want this reconciliation .
there was the rash , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was cl@@ assy and he was hardly heat of warmth , even for its restra@@ ined relationships .
in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better will improve .
the next day , a newspaper stated that Erdo@@ gan had never heard that it would never happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that the state of State of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian battle ship at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow in response to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen Russia into his back .
the failure was even greater , as it was committed by a thought friend .
the Vet@@ rau@@ en is going to build up again , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , when the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse for President Erdoğan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire lie clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily all friends who can get , after spending the last month during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat close to his amber .
again , terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter wing@@ ed , which accounts for several million Russian tourists every year on the Turkish coast .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the television budget predicted fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , since it was in response to the attempted power of power as a weak response .
in addition , the persistent Gro@@ ll pass through the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke that it is to reduce the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian head of U.S. won a bonus in Ankara with security that he requested after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the elected state organs .
that &apos;s well noticed for Moscow is a self understand@@ able , which itself has a deeply sitting fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ ancing palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of Foreign lateral &quot; : two countries that have cast off the West and will feel bad now .
nevertheless , despite the public pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ation , there are still large differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but to support Russia and Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference , both pre@@ sidents at the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even stri@@ ped that issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , the NATO member of Turkey f@@ oss the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s head office , the R@@ BS mark should only be reduced to a back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since then , when she had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago .
during this time brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have been used to protect other final consumer marks .
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to push more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but is not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange rate to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer , which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is being employed at our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we now get more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing a global goals , but will pursue local goals .
each of these stamps will be completely different in its own con@@ greg@@ ations for something completely different and our staff will work among these trademarks .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing no longer , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Staff .
it would have been three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori works champagne after a double at New@@ market that brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th gain

the three @-@ month winner of D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about what happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ quet Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er up , when he brings the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester : Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career defeat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey on modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which has only been reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which diff@@ ers him from the others in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already inspired fans for this sport since years .
I said Frank@@ ie from some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he would have received 6,000 win@@ nings , if not only a weekend and grand@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey would be !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , it is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had returned difficulties when he returned from his six months of lock , but showed an impressive characteristic of strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his top shape .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia &apos;s Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin tried un@@ expect@@ edly his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the most eng@@ aging confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transportation affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is said that Putin has ordered without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) , that he later became the head of the government and head of the government personnel .
he said to Putin on his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State regarding legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his followers .
convince the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff has returned to their own request .
but despite the sc@@ orn for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
no one knows this .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was praised as a potential President , once again wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you to do this very complicated post in early 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ying for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the position in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin in former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in the most .
once upon Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia following Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin had to reject his constitution .
but this item was taken by another , approaching ally &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was prime minister before he became President three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he proposed producers
Gibson was participating in a physical meditation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common opinion his dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gibson , who played the Special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set , it came to artistic differences and a differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be around the 75 fishing around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were provided by a fountain of fountain .

Queens@@ ch Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion co@@ stly project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the north @-@ deck of Queens@@ wei@@ t Cross@@ ing , which means that the bridge is now associated with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four verses of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers near the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 clas@@ ps .
the project will be completed by a £ 1.@@ 35 billion project until May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown was visiting the site nowadays a visit and was one of the first to go down from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the building of Queens@@ far@@ ing Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ ick@@ y activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks on its place and the last section of the de@@ cks will get a che@@ at stake in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
for this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter @-@ looking high @-@ edge and deep construction represents the sh@@ utter .
after the installation of the last road@@ map and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap on the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the Northern ad@@ dock 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y activity .
massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
hei@@ gh@@ ted , as toler@@ ances where the team works , they were tiny - on each side it was only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after she was thrown by her fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station failed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty floating in safety while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat apart from its range until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was killed at the age of 60 and was found on a bo@@ wel without rescue leaves .
they all arrived on board of the coastal town and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck left un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor had a emergency con@@ front , however , this stimul@@ ates the boat from the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has w@@ akes up today about these men .
seriously wounded - man sti@@ cking to his ex @-@ girlfriend
one man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead of the non @-@ cut perpet@@ rators the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when this came into the flat , he sto@@ cked twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured and injured in the body .
the police arrested the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ming then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 year old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out to the house with her life .
on the road she met the ex @-@ life of the husband .
when the two women gu@@ essed the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had her sister to the site and attacked his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green said : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action plan living &quot; for the next advice .
but controversy is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the favorable apartments ?
a control is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build us with the Gre@@ ens : anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to prove 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock .
however , the major dispute in the town hall is , however , according to Brat@@ mann : how do you want to build investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing project program , which will cost millions and will have to be financed , should provide for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
investors want to make investors as a few regulations .
the left hand wants to earn hardness levels for investors .
regardless of him , so viol@@ inist , h@@ ort a deteri@@ oration of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will provide for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet completely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how does one compar@@ es the loss of another 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going to run in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , so the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed by the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring homes back into the price range .
this is possible in the west town .
to a blow , solve the problem .
because in the western city , the end of Fri@@ sts are running out .
around 1800 apartments you could return to the price range for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want to do the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the Western city is dras@@ tically increased dras@@ tically , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social workers in just a few neighbour@@ hoods shall not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there is still movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CDU must be with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on more sites for family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does not mean , not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating , how the world changes .
that teenage boys and child are not going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa to get active .
initially , the time on the screen was on TV set , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activity will not exclu@@ de each other .
I also refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , game cards and other Sp@@ in @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop@@ culture decreased slightly ahead of the game &apos;s publication in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon go longer users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones go out and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase of steps which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post , announced that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw material for performance increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public relations campaigns for health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rely on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to get to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful on Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors to make them fun .
three pillars of health will be covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is a shortened game cor@@ rup@@ ters , which always have to compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone may walk towards a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could follow our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the New will lose its appeal and use the use of time .
because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and will be able to help people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ party title and extended the gap between itself and the rest of the world under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
the total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ Team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ etic Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ f at the Swe@@ ar bal@@ ances during the single multi @-@ campaign women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ party title and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of its generation , or even at all .
it broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey was found at the end .
this success is in the same league such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated their sports art for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it a@@ waited for a final inspection in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man surro@@ unds them after having won gold and silver in a single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal at Tuesday , while she served on the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top , during their long time on the top , never the future plans to have planned , this is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music that would match at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became power .
since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a multi @-@ cave competition , a victory that will hold on as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , the image was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and bo@@ ars - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title title - l@@ acked .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig bal@@ ances and put on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her final - and tears fell on Bil@@ es gloss@@ y red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision , which once described it in their collective book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ alists , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her soil , she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ua , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed to be dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as regards Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ eter has a completely new meaning in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims are shot in a car by car .
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the most le@@ thal attacks in the first series of series of production by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a tour , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ ack@@ ers took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of shooting took place the investig@@ ators to become a close look , whether they are connected to four of the previous attacks .
altogether , predominantly in His@@ panic residential areas were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks and two injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to exp@@ ose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and passed away later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness distributed the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was estimated at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the plant &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ics and secured a ball out of the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , let &apos;s go on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund she can never recognize it under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they beat him to be institutional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of help .
Edmund couldn &apos;t sit down to his third year , neither sit still cra@@ w@@ ling , and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give him a drawing language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- it says . Edmund hasn &apos;t invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is too early to say how it is affecting the life that is associated with the z@@ ic@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an un@@ aware future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time since long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the C@@ ic@@ avirus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .

why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I wanted to introduce myself under the women &apos;s Olympic Debut and that of more than one reason .
first , I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspi@@ res for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the head of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one Af@@ ro @-@ American woman among women .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ tik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was awarded the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won the gold medal for women .
Mann@@ ers member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport species , but you can &apos;t see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality is that Tur@@ ns sees a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts in the first line of private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , which will cost the training , set @-@ up , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are situated in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these verses the Turner receive its entire training and this is a dev@@ il@@ ful and long lasting commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , coach of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both of having started their athl@@ ete since they began with the tower .
we have to be inspired by the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a performance and easier accessible gym .
I founded my gym foundation 20 years ago .
in my events we have offered free and affordable hotels in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ i ) and trains national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high quality turbines , which make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and confidenti@@ ality for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real picture of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympics team and thank you so many young girls are motivated by different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ stan would like to organize more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes due to the reform of a reform of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors , who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans to introduce plans to en@@ forced the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be present in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients to be harmful .
the first resident doctors should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly work to improve maintenance times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for Assi@@ sten@@ tion , divided the last night in a message with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have committed to the proposed contract , according to serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current occupancy crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors have fallen under the new contract , must be made progress and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes of disp@@ utes through talks on the government &apos;s resistance , and sometimes on the af@@ ore@@ mentioned silence .
that happened to a speaking that Jeremy Hunt had made only the last month in the last month that his door would always be revealed .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now to lift up the vibration and talk about the concerns of assistance . &quot;
if he did not do this , the Assi@@ sten@@ ologists have made clear that they are ready to carry out more work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a feed of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 appointments before the nur@@ ses and specialist doctors involved in order to grant physicians on the strike chain .
the ministers hoping to end the dispute over changes due to the reform of the reform of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants to be a better weekly re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ cy , which are subject to contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called for assi@@ sts to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working measures are not just a little bit , but already loaded up teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ ment@@ ee of Assi@@ sten@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians and with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es positively respon@@ ds to the concerns concerning the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hoped that the continued positive commitment to other major topics - such as aston@@ ishment , flexibility during training , training sessions , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , training vacation and gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - such as serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after the authorities recommended to submit more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ ag@@ ulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart attacks for persons with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by an@@ odi@@ ous material in the arter@@ ial volumes that form the pads .
when the day breaks out , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that cause blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through blood stream and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack had to be subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven under the trading name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making it impro@@ bable formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the draft design of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Heal@@ th@@ echn@@ ologies Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from that .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - primarily the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . there is no treatment that passes over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ bo@@ ness makes election fraud thri@@ ve in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ bo@@ ness has led to the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities are ignored as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet @-@ member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and city houses to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ity concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now an ant@@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out dis@@ abling outside of elec@@ tr@@ ins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a identity card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a voters must only call his name and address .
the report suggests , do not remove remove ink on the finger of a person when she would give her election to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have access to community documents and decisions from un@@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial fraud , which is thus entering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ an@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special court decided that the official Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be revealed after a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his amber .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man should have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it was the relief of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a reproduction , when someone cho@@ oses another person as someone else .
Sir Eric said it would be in the whole country of evidence of fraud .
he expresses in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent let@@ tered election - which the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose one candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the tubes of evidence to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people to vote in accordance with the welcome of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Albanian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such a behaviour as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the eth@@ nic@@ ity of eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit the letter documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May into consideration , requires even harder registration checks to prevent the voting directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
options in consideration , voters before the election to ask for your identity .
do not remove any ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic exagger@@ ations concerning the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic mail@@ box .
ban that political activists work complete let@@ tering , and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the command to set out bul@@ locks for election stations .
a legislation that was facil@@ itated by a charge due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( census 1983 ) .
photographer banned in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters are going to go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets , there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ a Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ an@@ ism of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ speak@@ able , &quot; he said .
he was due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - pleaded not guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city council departments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ ge in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud heritage than the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympics in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are viewing this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , besides border and band , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ cat@@ astrop@@ hy of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion in this summer is not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when the social media is allowed to give up the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are running at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic risks that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the bike railway many people were on the Internet on how a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
in fact , the ar@@ cher@@ y got the mad@@ ness to the social media and gave it to hear that he has already heard about his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , Bra@@ dy divided the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good year@@ ling guy , so I &apos;m going to be as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be present in the center : the outstanding simil@@ arity between the British expan@@ se Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to go through as a Doppel@@ gänger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er@@ ator
another compar@@ ative comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ z , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova exhibits more than just the s@@ uns@@ aved skin and bl@@ on@@ st hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ ened by fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others enjoyed the simil@@ arities too .
theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope und Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter is an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular Ver@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , who is almost identical to actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which is her own wonderful , wide smile that is similar to the Star Gabrielle Union .

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went down as Mi@@ ef and died during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator at Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald thought his microphone was switched off when he finished his own opinion at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who has been picked up in the commentary team of C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went as Mi@@ ef , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , allowing it to open the gap to China .
spectators watching in Canada quickly re@@ acted online , after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator have just said that the 14 year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did a pig died ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idi@@ ot hasn &apos;t broken that they were still on show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China has been told by the dark 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ swi@@ ms for women as well : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to put him on him many words .
Twitter users didn &apos;t hold back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ bel Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
it only shows the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like c@@ assi@@ sts . # .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We excuse us that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , we &apos;re sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ us on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to excuse yourself in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it right that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers yesterday night and ap@@ ologi@@ ze to our followers in social media .
to make one clear@@ er , By@@ Metat@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortun@@ ate elected formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald asked himself in the broadcast and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment , which I made after the female swi@@ ms in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ let , excuse me , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took care of the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there was no dis@@ regard , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark appe@@ ased about women living in the middle of business sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to see when a woman departed their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered her as she looked at it , and put them back into the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she returned to og and the business , without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , withdrew their own tr@@ unks and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply stood there , just like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ tu@@ ally , when they withdrew from the fore@@ ground , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ missions , before they finally decided that she was nothing pleased , and went out , and went out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone would observe - or think about the person who &apos;d buy the under@@ pants under circumstances which had tried them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would have supp@@ ort@@ lessly with home , who had an other person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to pull out the garments of the sale after she went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ s to go home and find out that another woman had her and got out again and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one speaker of Pri@@ ma said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
when you get back from behind , then you should turn yourself as an example , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and get out of the line line , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says .
grab the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the kne@@ e in the body and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers put together pain together , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the barrel and move back while they set the weapon on him .
in att@@ ack@@ ers , which are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ ack@@ ers can not shoot .
at the same time , they beat the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backward and do the weapon for him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi prepar@@ es .
but remember that it &apos;s not enough to cover your money with a rob@@ ber@@ y , if you are not a motorcycle Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a tourist guide to the dirt spots in Europe
a British trav@@ eler under@@ nourished his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex in a serious test - by turning some of the most polluted and most polluted places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel gate Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk sh@@ ab@@ ed its wake to a Euro bill , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a washing kno@@ b of a tractor toilette as well as a public phone in Russia to provide the resistance to its immune system .
before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometers to show and show us what it will be possible .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to cut the rinse button on a tractor fan , which has already been used by thousands of other things , may actually be rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually in a kitchen sp@@ try more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its Dar@@ ms by travelling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to train stations up to r@@ ust of toilets , the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film , he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lag . &quot;
in the film , he was just the case for his reputation .
the only thing he denied was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sampling showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number is freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ ous number 4000 units , while freshly washed hands a weight of less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel agent &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this comes the worst thing I &apos;ve got into a toilet , near . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing better than that !
I &apos;m going to swal@@ low here , because it is in@@ geni@@ ous here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company was buried Mr. Wright with vali@@ o vas@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is intri@@ gu@@ ing at the same time and , at the same time , explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .

they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way of information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of things I have directed to him , as the ek@@ ig@@ matic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to bring to Ian , to stimul@@ ate them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats in movies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of respondents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally products containing the lac@@ tic lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroys Del@@ og@@ ation of social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ ozi@@ ale family left their social flat after a delay of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed for@@ ci@@ bly from their property , individuals found the property of residential property the property in a ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls made cro@@ aking holes on , wood boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was ador@@ ned on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned at the walls .
the family were moved , and it is assumed that she lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the home management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it is afraid that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account , because this estate is probably considered not as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , while the police lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had joined the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ et@@ ters and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house that will be demolished under circumstances , age was found .
in the property , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden sticks were torn down .
neighbours said they had to fight on the street and called regularly the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ens her and her partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property , after she gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were afraid of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep tomorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have missed the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
garbage and old toys were thrown on the over@@ lay side of the municipal house .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant sow@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
it was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult , and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church that have cour@@ ageous to us and have received the information we have done .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors , and the message is convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , situated in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house@@ keeper will now have to remove garbage bags that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and orph@@ an@@ ages , perio@@ dic@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
skel@@ eton received a fine of money , after having found himself guilty of class B in merchant view .
she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at a car accident .
after being without shelter , T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms walls of the house were sum@@ med with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that she is del@@ ici@@ ously del@@ ici@@ ously , who do not keep the assignment of the house
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with the fact that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the home@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who are able to behave without self @-@ disgu@@ ises , as well as to those who were sworn by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate a criminal and anti@@ social behaviour , who continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our communities .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup on FC Sev@@ ille , the return game is rising three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w win has to do with the cap@@ tive cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ And@@ re is missing .
the German suffered a b@@ ular de@@ fle@@ ction in the kne@@ e , with the demand for bar@@ ca at least , at least for the support of Claudio Bravo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er W@@ ung@@ ers compete in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one .
coach Luis Enrique repe@@ aled this respect for a clear decision and made Bravo in the league , but T@@ er hits the fore@@ front in most of the remaining applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new game play , there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ ver@@ al@@ stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stre@@ wed the second triumph in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
the top @-@ list of the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; won the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ z@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the end@@ game and made themselves the title among each other .
so it was clear that the third time a Chinese single @-@ title would take a single @-@ title in the signs of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympics Tre@@ pp@@ ets was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were up to the record alone , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had withdrawn himself on the sho@@ res and left their cont@@ est@@ ants in the fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the match until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game he pos@@ ing gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma had really wanted to fight with his 28 @-@ year old opponent in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma was not the expected @-@ to @-@ a@@ waited match .
nevertheless , however , enough amazing ball@@ change were to be seen .
Mi@@ mis@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had moved a Ri@@ pp@@ ment last after that , &quot; ultimately , &quot; ultimately , &quot; with tin only had to be content .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become similar to a high @-@ table tennis era .
Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed of &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in election campaign
the leaders of the US Republi@@ cans have been pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , also in the traditionally conservative states of their majority .
Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a more rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as foreign correspon@@ dents reported .
after 16 rival were thrown out of the race &apos;s own republi@@ can camp , now the doubts are growing in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt are false reports about his can@@ di@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can floods w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , there were Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything different than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not enough for him on the end of reasons of the political correc@@ t@@ ness that is in order , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better revers@@ al values .
instead , instead , the candidate of the Republi@@ cans for Congress is stronger than the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud with D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee in the event .
Ken@@ ias athletes are threatened with the second D@@ oping affair with the Rio de Janeiro Olympics Games .
after an attempt to take home in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with , immediately , to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan functioning mentioned that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test named a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ seller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is the team management Ken@@ ias from the D@@ oping Con@@ trol@@ le@@ uren .
the IA@@ AF world association has received the IOC for information about the case in order to investigate its own investigation , the IA@@ AF speaker distributed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC will make the IA@@ AF a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and wrote himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample returned and signed , &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credi@@ tation of the athl@@ ete who stood on the list for training controls in the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing world championship .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athletics Men &apos;s leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been pulled by the Rio Olympics .
it should be informed against the d@@ oping tests of his country via anti @-@ d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was reportedly arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been on the IOC to numerous d@@ oping tests for more than a longer time .
in the announcement of the IOC &apos;s announcement more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics has been noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the visa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on the African country to create a anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , the ARD will always be restored , that in Kenya d@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IOC is a member of Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put them in the Russian Athletics Championships .
in this case , it could be proven that this sport species is covered and systematically ged@@ don .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

in the orchestra , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older than Maria .
she re@@ members herself with melanch@@ ol@@ y with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional musi@@ cally !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is wise , of course nai@@ vely , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I used as a Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a monster generous person .
and Bart@@ oli are the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ atism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have gone to the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ anian citizens went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as discreet as it then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish congregation anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on ge@@ packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short term , the Kurdish congregation of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers who fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even become a few hundred thousand . &quot; the Group President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany is expecting a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; World &quot; leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government passed over months of Kurdish high bur@@ dens with criminal responsibility , 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed put@@ sch , se@@ cular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are going to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in its own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the army officer compl@@ ained that Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Albanian cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan would raise the journey to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already eradi@@ cated or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that the federal government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; witch @-@ hunting &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is also held in Germany .
in the last months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially the Kurds and opposition .
fire marking as a Gü@@ len followers , destroyed teachers and other university acade@@ m@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the K@@ em@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already recognised the largest group of asylum in Germany because of political persecution .
at the end of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognized being recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey cannot be found before war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum justified by the basis of the law are politically , so by state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the land .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
from 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the s@@ wis@@ s parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and land fight - that is biting .
the locals who are to be convinced by the campaigns they are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers that hang up posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and gather at the end of the votes cast out only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday @-@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave a campaign of just close to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , when you can say it at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strongly ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition of coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , has gained almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees of his big posters .
he travels across the land , spread ro@@ ses and chat a bit with people , as it did already his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise , past@@ ing have cold feet and gives German Chancellor Merkel &apos;s fault at the flour@@ ishing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts of pop@@ uli@@ sts , what will happen to him now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she has invited Angela Merkel to grand@@ parents Angela Merkel ; Merkel Parliamentary Group is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CDU ab@@ stain largely on the usual campaign events on market places and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air balloon .
this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the Union also noted that you have to crum@@ ble the basis that she needs to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people .
you are , like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the land of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU electoral fighting is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you must go there , where the people are doing , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to an especially dedicated election campaign .
in p@@ olls , S &amp; Ds were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , would be able to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they are making a modern virtu@@ e , and put their campaign in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is known as Claudia Mu@@ eller .
otherwise , green election fighting continues to settle for local stimul@@ us among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , kur@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ duc@@ al lakes and also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : visiting sites suffer from lock
at the speed with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise to praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made all fairly straight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells about the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no distor@@ tion .
the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south on the weekend , until the end of October everything will be completed .
he is also comm@@ end@@ owed to the building , for example , when it comes to set up the facility .
since the construction site on Monday moved to the South and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße was lifted in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg are again relaxed , the traffic situation has relaxed within the place .
citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic by the place seems to be back .
&quot; there was partly significant complaints , &quot; says the vice @-@ deputy management of the rehabilitation management of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scar@@ ves were seeking and more to their Nav@@ i confi@@ ded as the signs .
what led to that man@@ cher trucks appeared in residential areas .
as the speed limit has not been observed , the community has strengthened the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable excess , &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the location .
two to three per minute have been lit@@ tered .
the fastest one was on the pace of 77 kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it became qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small sol@@ ace that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ restoration has led to revenues in sales , each one wonders to look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
those who have to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; so much for other companies , for which the restoration has hardly consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; at most light reduction , &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; the running form is missing . &quot;
the local sha@@ kes were the strongest along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ en@@ threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers are missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales booked up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street connection took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to put back two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff members have to be released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , the president Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation to be answered with the hint that the restaurant will benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B . now they also need the dis@@ advantages caused by the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other country circles , where so anything funding was handled .
at all sounds , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has already been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
however , other regular guests are now likely to understand less frequently due to the complicated transport tro@@ users .
if you do not go down , it &apos;s also different .
in the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers &apos; biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
construction work for six months , it is already brutal .
it is constantly being screw@@ ed to laws in the name of the terrorist attack .
after the recent attacks the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now entering a thick security package .
but what has a political status with terror to do ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all of his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; says the Minister of Interior Minister at the launch of his new safety package .
they are not asking anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in that .
but the minister of the Interior was given him to results , and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will have a little time away before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but these are the more extensive , however .
some things are already known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the bu@@ cks encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities are also not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second suit for suggestions , who had not yet to do with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under sentence and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream of the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still keep this anyway for reasonable and demanding nothing , which I have no chances of the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
these are partly in itself : it plans fast procedures for shifts and more possibilities for par@@ tak@@ ings of people in front of the deportation .
refugees that are targeted targeted in the country are to check out their smartphones and make social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ ings for up asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or their papers consci@@ ously throwing their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
some also works even un@@ balanced and makes questions open .
and with some points - at the im@@ treatment of Ged@@ ser for example - the question arises : what does it mean to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be found in speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
there are also many people in view of high refugee concerns around the safety .
and things , which people deeply busy , were not able to cl@@ aps themselves in election events .
the inner safety is enormous ably in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is great .
and yes , elections are available .
in the context of internal security , Union and SPD , they are increasingly active in position .
in the past few days , between the two parties went high .
only a gar@@ nish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers , where the Ress@@ or@@ ch@@ efs also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also bl@@ oss@@ oms here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
he will hold nothing of a return from a double pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
you are new to go , don &apos;t make sense .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban , he was un@@ constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is un@@ fixed on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is to show the co@@ ali@@ tional partner only .
there is a lot of things to take care of battle .
but the SPD also tried to appeal to the topic of internal security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes just to talk with a lot of conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel cars , prices increase worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
in response , there is a concept for the call .
Volkswagen launches the following deliveries into the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car park can continue to show an increase in the previous year despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened the overall sales brand in Western Europe and loaded with the overall sales , as announced in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s figure .
in Western Europe alone , following China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany spent the deliveries by almost one sixth .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there has been in some core markets through &quot; modified economic conditions &quot; to maintain a purchase .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was stressed out of the EU to exit the EU .
in the USA , where the emissions aff@@ ect@@ ant first escal@@ ated , there is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
a large support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to climb through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only one output of 0.9 % is available to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to report a sales spl@@ ash from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament into the workshops .
during the re@@ armament , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the reconstruction of cars has no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity was no deteri@@ oration .
the car park covers the customer after conversion a &quot; guaranteed loan &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company .
reason be legal fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Volkswagen to its German clients now a guarantee for diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW representative in the federal state ministry .
from the Ministry of Commerce it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has successfully completed the issues of my investigation committee and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated by the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) .
VW has acquired the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after re@@ armament , no deteri@@ oration , and all typical vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself used the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was in business divisions .
in the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers would come to a workshop half a year after converting about with an engine damage to a workshop , and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do .
also , in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any damage to do with any damage caused by the g@@ ass@@ al scandal , with respect to possible guarantees , as it was called .
therefore , the VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demand for rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ed or day money &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of an individual and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings would have to pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks Money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ y@@ - or daily balance .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for ger@@ many times , he has 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other and could not accept it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and account for 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay € 4000 for each million . &quot;
now the cost is further on after the de@@ fle@@ ction principle .
the cash is easy to leave in the po@@ res of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four over@@ s , I would not like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank .
most customers would have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few people mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course on the ECB caused considerable cost in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can carry alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational permanent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Country had made headlines from three million euros with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , the chief executive leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay attention to in@@ sol@@ es , the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is rich in wealth by wealth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ operative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks , who charge an assessment of deposits for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , to the negatives against the Individu@@ als , is very , very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be like that in the width .
destination plates : who is buying records ?
lon@@ ely male middle age love plates .
before you hur@@ ry to divide it under the p@@ seud@@ onym non@@ Al@@ le@@ Ein@@ sam@@ ic ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most likely resurrection of sound plates does not want to be on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have purchased a record recently , all pre@@ views are between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ters retain their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I stand in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and a wild stri@@ ving before I stand , my hands hold and something determin@@ ant of the story like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a look at a close look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart rate So@@ H@@ os slowly comes to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers are located - there is a hand@@ ful fantastic record specialist .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops , and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men mean age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by my home ) , dressing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records , which he was not able to buy , when she was sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies that appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believes that many customers that he hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let it take to buy their old records .
from the talks , which I have led , people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records sold to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to followers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ on@@ ica , to recognize that record stores provides a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ est@@ ors .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to return to the stability of familiar sound platforms , from objects that are happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a staff of an turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record the last month they haven &apos;t heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ table .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ asted through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ ut@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone first came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so I can add them to the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are the younger people , not elderly , who come first slowly .
stop , which has dedicated the sound plates nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am going to clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , Teen@@ agers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesi@@ ology and sex@@ sha@@ ken pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ers - it is good to see such di@@ vers@@ ität in the customer .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ing psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard , if one stands for someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the business and viewed the Vari@@ et@@ es for sale .
it &apos;s more a man@@ ne@@ quin than a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collecting of plates does not represent real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a crazy gro@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers . Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the certificate that je@@ ans prefer a group of young Teen@@ agers , I was watching a group of young Teen@@ agers , who for a moment to buy pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at them - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to gras@@ p them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the person that is most of the luxury objects like plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree that , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , turn@@ around and in on@@ line@@ ages exist .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety with the b@@ um@@ meln by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while star@@ ring the eyes of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of middle ages .

French Court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp .
a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees .
in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should settle down 72 provision@@ ally shops in which persons within the camp goods , sale of cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hairdres@@ ser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy that would not be paid out of tax and a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important as the free meals provided by the government supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the temporary businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provision@@ ally , but the fact that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture will be absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely pre@@ judi@@ ci@@ ary conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by the low re@@ mor@@ row was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is most commonly used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of protection , un@@ accompanied minor min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; cafe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of living in jungle camps have risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and continues to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ f@@ th place at the en@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to be honest , hon@@ estly , to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyze in peace which had reasons to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll see everything we have changed in the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , the temp@@ o @-@ heal@@ ers should be effective effectively .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident focus , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on motorway @-@ building or a gentle bridges with temporary tem@@ pos there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary flowering for compliance with speed limit .
however , a durable building can be too dangerous or complex .
the en@@ forcement trailer is independent : its battery lasts for five days , the case data are encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as the departure network after time , driving strips and vehicle class also can also monitor .
in the high @-@ run state , one can move the tra@@ ilers according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hook .
with that it is not easy to be cl@@ oned , it is lowered into the measuring mode , so that the wheels are crushed in the ar@@ mo@@ red and also van@@ ish safe outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ aze with the new technology : recently , France has reli@@ ed 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain pic@@ ks silver in the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji master@@ y Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain during the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday night to a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a score of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium here in Rio .
in Fiji it distributed a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , back , line run and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of every color .
the defeat was sunk by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
however , in this form , Fiji had beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one day tomorrow a gold medal for his neck will be hanging : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ille .
she only lost one thing .
this cap will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and left the GB@@ S out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went down 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au settled in the corner .
with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB is scar@@ ed to the ball .
a h@@ ype of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa stopped to achieve a third gate , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the res@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ m@@ apped through a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji had to be born to play 7 , while GB was still left .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time by and lock the fever gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South se@@ al@@ ans , whose fans sang and d@@ umps on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ door with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and crushed and crushed in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the racing - British transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ print and scored a gate among the position in the second half .
a brilliant late late tac@@ kling Tac@@ Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side teams , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the coach to rowing
there will be no engine of gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it were only those who sat on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when she went to the second Olympics in a row without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports that had such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ 15 un@@ protected deployment , which is also an example of an example .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that reflect on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on that contribute to con@@ cre@@ ment progress made the difference , and no one was not il@@ able than the trainer , which would not survive this day , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption was at a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the un@@ ce@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who had a ner@@ st@@ inc@@ tive morning to spend some more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning who was a leader in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in action in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wreck for this week . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is repeated only how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so there &apos;s a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to coaching or wish a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with whom their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very close at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something ra@@ bies .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
a couple will take time for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity :
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ ure group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small f@@ ailing pot@@ able water @-@ purpose unit as a model for the large water producers .
so it was said that some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken made the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the Fourth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed as exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the twin @-@ association company , of which 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose Association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ joined group , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , Community Breit@@ brunn , produces about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
member churches are the con@@ greg@@ ations of the church , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller was set up as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very varied , and they have stretched from water management and maintenance activities , the budget plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency groups on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as outstanding events they called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , plot purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial breakdown of water pipes .
there was no stagn@@ ation and I was always included in the future , because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
they praised G@@ ö@@ llers , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose , and he worked out the water purpose Association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was present as a real practition@@ er , to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ure group to the Nit@@ rat@@ ern@@ ity in front of the sub @-@ forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
for this , he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , on the other hand , praised Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart , and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ let at church bells on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the settlements could be supplied with water .
also , the supply of Neu@@ brunn is also able to maintain only once the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with battles .
the management of pot@@ able water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ rebellious go openly to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made significant progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by their son , they believed that they should die .
meanwhile , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come forward and learn to be privately in New York , where the best therapists take place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to give an example : if I ask him something for two years , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Netanyahu said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ ier man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ rebellious connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man is shooting for li@@ fel@@ ine
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and said to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator was on the run , after him I will publi@@ ci@@ ble publicly .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown burnt and has a g@@ at@@ ze .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a smoo@@ ther .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with themselves , so the police .
if Sven S. sees , the 110 will call .
the police talks about an &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 .
the competent police in Lu@@ beck wanted to do no information about the initial court or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing of killing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than we don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ emen group in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the ey@@ e@@ witnesses , it was a special position ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - Light view for German steel industry
the cau@@ tious and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions @-@ height .
financial loads , which threatened the industry from green power promotion , are of the table .
it remain in the liberation of renewable energies moving in the stock refurb@@ ishment to so @-@ called egg production in the German steel industry , said the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission first planned to use the steel producer , which use gases made from the high @-@ burning stove for their own consumption , to register for cash .
according to the German industry &apos;s industry , additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission on talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced , an EEG re@@ location of 20 percent fall .
but this also won &apos;t be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on its own production plant .
this is why the status quo has been written extensively .
special meaning is the successful artwork of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emission of emissions are climate and employment goals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and substantial pricing pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , than the world &apos;s largest producer of China in view of the weakness of severe steel to the world market .
European manufacturer throw Chinese steel concerts as a prize d@@ umping before .
during this spring , the situation has relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on impor@@ ters , to others , the economic prospects in China got up .
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
most recently the prices were stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to do not exclu@@ de any works of individual works .
in the German steel industry , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturer remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced approximately 3.4 million tons over six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the business association Stahl ha@@ sted on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced amount returned to each other in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates increasing output with increasing output .
community , spirit , health : sing seniors good
singing Ki@@ pp already accompanied their whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior citizen .
&quot; sing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
there is something good to do with her health and mind .
because S@@ ingen is like a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler .
most of the seniors sing in chor@@ us and sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular merger , seniors can hold social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures are often solving , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join us and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
the senior citizens train a deep and controlled resp@@ i@@ ration .
those who calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in age , S@@ ingen is an optim@@ istic hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labor association of the senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher job worth , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth time .
through song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people are de@@ structive to people in a long distance .
when singing the head , a special achievement is also requested , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and to focus on a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
older people , who live alone , do not only practice themselves on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition which one lear@@ ns through the singing in choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in choir .
to show yourself : if I do so long for something , I &apos;ll get better and alert about myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks , have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing men , who can hear when a sound goes on it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , seniors different ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone sings among the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a retirement choir , one can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the environment .
if you want to sing in a church choir , contact the church or the church .
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet re@@ cher@@ che .
those who want to sing , should be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good and has a bit liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , what effect the calls of cat bab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
at their surprise , the mist@@ ress left the male not cold - but they kept themselves in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the fatigue level of cat bab@@ ys on the mi@@ ths of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who choose in great need as scientists from the veter@@ an University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
tom@@ cat will also react to the calls of K@@ itt@@ ens - however , always equal .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly inv@@ oked ma@@ i@@ dens to the male either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist of Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is the first authorized study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; in this Friday .
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am distingu@@ ishes with the dr@@ y@@ ness of their help .
a total of nine adult cat and eight co@@ ders were observed from the MH@@ H animal life .
they were played for a ru@@ by of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger K@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers are holding their findings despite the low sample for seasonal .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this calls of the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acts at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ons .
some studies also showed that women acted sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .

this does not apply to those who are susp@@ ects , the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not made in front of the football .
the prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .

the sport is - like all the country - split in supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
particularly fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what &apos;s the Turks , however , given to dramatic experiences in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans even agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at the winner of the gala &quot; Gala , &quot; he will come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
the Köl@@ ner introduced its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 seal .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; took him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trop@@ hy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; I found the dis@@ appointing season for the record car@@ et@@ aker .
after the Pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also retired in the Europa League early .
in the sweet Li@@ g it was only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we did it and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas started the game year better .
most of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served with 26 seasonal lovers as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que base the base to the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , during the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas , he had only dis@@ closed Gom@@ ez according to the coup attempt , not to return on the political situation in the country according to his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; asked the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to be ready to aband@@ on around a third of his € 7.5 million an estimated annual season , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence can &apos;t be paid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa not allowed to start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio by medals .
the topic D@@ oping is determined before the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who , after a d@@ oping @-@ lock , had been drawn shortly before the games , was kicked off at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it offered himself a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a opened smile , she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her performance .
when it was established that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm .
but there are many more athletes , despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already locked two times for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the second @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month sperm after taking the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ done .
after having had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Championship of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the forbidden stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine by 2016 .
Per@@ kovic stri@@ ped the ignor@@ ance and was locked up for six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold rating .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , has been positively tested and imprisoned for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , praying Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m so far the fastest man in the world .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athl@@ ete became known as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after a testosterone dem@@ oping was diagnosed .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old has had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ oping and release the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a verdict of the International Sports Tribunal .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ran@@ kings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and Gold@@ cal@@ ori@@ tin was not tested recently in May , but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship were found on taking an banned dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran out on July 13 .
bomb attacks in Thailand - Austrian , injured - more dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
they have suffered dis@@ appearances and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this again .
their journey was planned for early September .
whether another explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , also Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of State is standing in permanent contact with the local authorities , so be@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a Nightlife two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ine was killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early then two jumps went up , while the authorities were killed another man .
the bombing in the morning was also reported by Phu@@ ket in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded an urban staff .
the explo@@ sives went to the air according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct of coastal police .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , whose name was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army death Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ ag@@ av@@ ee Friday early on journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was too early to express yourself to possible moti@@ ves - most likely the actions of the Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize patterns that are typical for bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks did not appear in connection with the Islam@@ ist fighting movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one rather go out , that the bombs of the forces of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country . however , they were not informed about the exact date and the places .
the group is still un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks .
the police rejected its leaders throughout the country , the security area around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not set against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to reason of reason , bomb explo@@ sions recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities necessarily .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations there are not necessary trips to this provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military major influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that the bombs were an attempt to take chaos , while the country is moving toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody violence , keeps itself good , the kingdom once again led to stability and order .
however , since years , the military has not managed to get the insur@@ rection of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
over 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , there were killed 20 people killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine . most of them foreign tourists were killed .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t assault of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the visa of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several nation@@ alities , the Con@@ stitu@@ ent Con@@ stitu@@ ents have also made the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for taxation against the freedom of democratic fundamental rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional leader Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , migrants are diff@@ am@@ inated in Islamic faith or the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
constitutional citizens in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority is closely matched to the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to get their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts trying to pron@@ ounce them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertisement for your own thing .
propaganda is to speak emotion@@ ally to people .
young people are due in a special manner .
this is dangerous .
finally , it had given reports from several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species will only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain people , the extrem@@ ist , change their target and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , whether such people have controlled influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights to terrorism in this context .
but we found in the past few years that there may be legally binding structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further legal group groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m .
a clear signal or Europe @-@ wide control of ster@@ ster@@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
however , Ma@@ ate heard that many over@@ jo@@ ys went to the account of people who had not entered the scene in the scene before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum in asylum were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimes or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed strains that had nothing at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example , CDU , SPD or Left , who , however , have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic risks or world records from Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am easily the most important s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he had no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he disappeared - no matter how far the neck@@ line was selected .
Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral interest in the social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends his pre @-@ run and occupied the 5@@ 9th place from 59 Star@@ ters .
it was rather its not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old takes part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ frequ@@ ented countries .
since most athletes run in A@@ thop@@ a@@ edic , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
the first nick@@ name made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid The Sun , with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny for him .
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters of acqu@@ itt@@ ens , there was no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the course of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i participated in medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the gig of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a cross over 100 meters of acqu@@ itt@@ ens alone .
he was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old worked just eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump does not see the imp@@ ending election system not so narrow
the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a election campaign in Florida .
if you have nothing to do with the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already taken an alternative video .
he then drive into the holiday .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump losing the US presidential election in November , it would be either fold , or I have a very , very beautiful , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him on the end of reasons of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus , he called Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more resistance formed in the party .

however , the entries came suddenly - but not quite surprising .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring are still not able to see after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K transactions every participant shareholders will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , it would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; says it .

accidents - bus sli@@ pping in tren@@ ch audi@@ ble in tren@@ ches : eight injured .
in an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants were suffered serious injuries , the police shared with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to withdraw their data according to the opposite direction , which took part in the opposite direction .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance cars and an emergency car came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ ellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ries and possible witnesses to report with the police .
the fees per cubic meter of water is due to the field of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , san@@ itation fee will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ houses ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted on the permission of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Kul@@ mb@@ ach for these se@@ wage plants .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to under@@ take the facilities covering the facilities .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg need to get deeper into the pur@@ se .
the commission increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as an administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a radical balance of charges for the waste water community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub@@ ways out of the previous calculations would be equal .
the iter@@ ations of gra@@ vit@@ ation was founded so that in all three se@@ wage plants with a very small se@@ wer@@ age , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
thus , due to the small distribution board , for example , expenses for necessary repair of several thousand Euros would be engraved .
moreover , the se@@ wer@@ age is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , during the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation period in all three plants , not least due to their age , san@@ itation and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by mechanical ventilation system because of a loss of damage .
in the pump pole , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and at the pond water level . after nearly 20 years the initial sep@@ tic pond had to be installed , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge disp@@ osed and an additional ventil@@ ating option had to be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenditure came to these extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in the new calculations period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still under the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ houses made clear that during the low se@@ wage fall into the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant have been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to be pre@@ judi@@ ced , especially since the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al cannot be completed by these plants , as it is de@@ fi@@ ant facilities .

all errors will arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of propag@@ ating the app Black@@ face and white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week struck a filter , which gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth and f@@ aded che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ out . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversy raised to a bigger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility .
the news and indig@@ nation were widely circul@@ ated on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but outside standing , the r@@ ents have experienced , remin@@ ded the filter in viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others have opted for the anim@@ e comparison .
in an E @-@ Mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets have been widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; inf@@ ring@@ ing and least un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not compatible , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted is drawn up to the extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all keep in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big crowd of young people - who are vers@@ ed in the race as their older opponent - could rather go out , sensitivity to expect .
if one of snap@@ shots are a picture that is created for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same .
in a phone interview for medium and in a telephone interview she said that her @-@ related controversy would reflect a lack of di@@ vers@@ ität in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that mostly has left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers to ens@@ ity its workforce and points to its status as private enterprise .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently set up a staff responsible , focusing on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and internal integration environments .
Z@@ hu said therefore , that she will be closed all of their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military @-@ F@@ ailed ISIS intelligence information , speci@@ fies the Congress of Congress fest
military Command division of the United States Central Command changed subsequent information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Armed Conf@@ lic@@ ees , Intelligence Service and the Army of Defence , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret Services , which reported how they changed their ass@@ essments in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news information that were typically issued by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com conven@@ ed regularly a posi@@ tional picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have permitted the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; asked Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
management errors in Cent@@ Com date up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct references to change reports that government pointed out under Obama , shows how analysts were subjected to pressure from their pre@@ sides , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the Congress clearly stated as the facts , &quot; presented the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com minority was publicly announced that a military reg@@ ression of Mos@@ sul@@ s will begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; he said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas , in a position .
from the middle of 2014 until the mid @-@ year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the subsequent reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force in life after them was played , analysts agree with regard to the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigation will be continued .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defence Ministry .
democratic members of the news conference held on Thursday their own findings , agreed with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a superior process for the preparation of subsequent ass@@ essments in I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking Democ@@ rat in Kom@@ or@@ ee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship .
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of subsequent reports , &quot; did the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; delivered a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analyst regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which were recorded following complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tors were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts are also quite con@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of this important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year saw the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for the annual ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written font in Iraq , looked at the consequences of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection of the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team decided to establish Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government &apos;s declaration that the refin@@ eries of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this recognition was not published , but the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ islat@@ ure due to its superior positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in mind .
however , she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will hit the first round in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place .
the first @-@ placed team will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that lead the other group .
as always the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising turbul@@ ence by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in her hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , since she could not qualify for the ca@@ des .
then came the year 2012 , in which she went to her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to use things for better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London we have now .
we have to break the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the match between 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ dge the ball into the gate around the Americans to make a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and in@@ escap@@ able , a Ras@@ ender s@@ quad@@ rant between competition and Stre@@ ets .
it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , from the wrist@@ bands to s@@ wimm@@ ers to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch to the television , read a paper or listen to the chat on your neighbor in the waiting shop , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens of black with dimples , could certainly be sent under this well @-@ known name that would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ es .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are sports , which are not generally accepted : aerial pist@@ ols , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it reign long .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me get your attention on the dis@@ crete charm of tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney the last 16 years has been so sp@@ icious , that many of whom I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic port .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
even though the US athletes sent to competition , it has never gained a medal in trampoline jumping and had a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outer side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear fit for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end til@@ ting - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ halle and Tau@@ chens , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; jump board . &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must take a range of falling movements ( turning , h@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
they are assessed according to an official Olympic program according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ round athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts hoping to go further in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes go and back , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but in the TV transmission also another cav@@ ity : the world or the Olympic champion .
the goal @-@ oriented stre@@ ben is no@@ isy , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir up an audience to tears .
but it is also what I feel at the watch of these games as a bit ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers an at@@ ori@@ ent .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or she jum@@ ped off , seem@@ ingly heavier as an astr@@ on@@ aut , go down , then down to the top , then effort@@ lessly .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no Wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , on the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men were on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block at two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will over@@ see in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by anxiety and objective of male athletes - like the male U.S. Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally ally of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators call for political changes in Ethiopia , beat on violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that the prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in failure .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid network of Western Europe with a fast growing economy .
but in the past few months , protests against the government de@@ pl@@ eted against the country and spread to more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen were fighting against un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , some videos on the protests , probably from the last or early this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a towel against a wall .
the chief of the UN Agency for Human Rights demands a further investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in the remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ite in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia had everything else than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ sidents were effective to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press people and do not have any other options except for protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in the Ethiop@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ esters .
a generation are prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from ground use to dig@@ ging in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
following a widespread vote , last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for those tender , controversial line resulted in hundreds of life in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced in recent years , could benefit the turbul@@ ence and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ration after years ago explo@@ de in the surface explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via social media , because cheaper smartphones have been more frequently and improved by Internet services .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them to protests as protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not the natural enemies .
since Ä@@ onen , Am@@ har@@ as , who come from e@@ thop@@ a@@ ens , mainly Christian floods , are living in politics and economics while living the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in low@@ land regions .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are there to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests found in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ publi@@ que illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly embarrass@@ ed in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and special contrac@@ tors to process opponents , and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to increase the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy confidence in the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many feared that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested that according to the analyst of analysts apparently exp@@ elled by the government and then stolen from the government .
during the following raz@@ ors , many prot@@ esters have been killed , even though it were less than in the past months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts predi@@ ct Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this does not intensi@@ fy the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ concep@@ tions of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media .
analysts say that protests the U.S. and other Western allies bring into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ue over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to be merged in an already vol@@ atile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ emig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that his campaign announced that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning communication skills of the Republi@@ cans on whether he is capable of communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow country@@ men who ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the original position , which he could not mean .
after gradu@@ ating on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to signi@@ fy , president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said that he was just sar@@ cas@@ tically .
the twe@@ et was the contrary to the previous day of which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ ator ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to reduce his statement by preventing his statement by remin@@ ded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate .
the last storm of criticism is desc@@ ending on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to focus on the focus of his campaign because of falling exchange rates to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes , and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
in late July , he drew strong criticism of himself when he said the Russians , Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , however , said later , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how specific messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , an communication experts who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think so , he is clever enough to keep his testimony , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump adopted an even corro@@ sive tone as its re@@ frac@@ tory values have gone back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to excuse for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of understanding his critics , to dis@@ car@@ ing his testimony , or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ iter into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his testimony .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps prominent princip@@ alities , were there a great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was interro@@ gated to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ chers , completely false and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Republi@@ cans attempt to argue that the government minist@@ ered by Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an out@@ minister , ISIS allowed themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and fell to them on each of his words and to be pre@@ set against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t know it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s excuse than just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more about the price of the market , Café come back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years , good coffee ser@@ ved .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue has been pushed out .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , which produced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
the native city found it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , it &apos;s also new .
an animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ term employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a client was offered to provide funds for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept much .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are sand@@ wiches , bacon and cheese and gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural reflec@@ tions .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodriguez , he said that he not@@ ices a st@@ oned current to old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point it would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee fall , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in the ver@@ b which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ year and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went in front of the work and ordered illegal di@@ ligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients in the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said he doesn &apos;t have a groove , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie that make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez Rodriguez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu into Poland and Rodriguez said he has prepared to make it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ baked coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that Café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café ended .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the operator of the local and the bri@@ c@@ els felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy by Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with equal people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while pulling in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive @-@ pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable salad .
when the repor@@ ters were min@@ ced , this took place the pair for a discussion on food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; I said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which regul@@ ates the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male fel@@ lows and it was served fresh pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that sent food to hunger Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country went through , no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans was a central , sp@@ elled subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gi@@ fted co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as curious was the new bud@@ get@@ ed food : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and K@@ illing were too basic food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as a &quot; wonderful way , food remains restored , &quot; when coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a cre@@ ep sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen , has become a rare ser@@ rated luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction was before taste or even healthy kitchen understood .
during their research for the book , which also recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onion with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
as never before or ever , bud@@ dies - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - The eating habits of the country is such a good one .
as published by recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become the &quot; budget &quot; budget &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic delic@@ ac@@ ulture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in his kitchen , he spoke as the one million@@ th man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was glorious real alien .
President Roosevelt had perhaps committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to act with his stomach a post@@ mark .
as described in the book , the an@@ di@@ ers of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors of Roosevelt said that the White House produced the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most ambitious food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected , once the country came back on her legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , the bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as science was applied to foods .
the couple was better understood at the writing of the book to better understand the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example how they could not throw foods away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
clock@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall .
after the plates were cleared out at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved to Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roosevelt had lunch at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said and added that it was a more common trick , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no designed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant di@@ pped a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ mp@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E spent three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed at bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at a Fass@@ bom@@ b@@ ben attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , according to the image newspaper so far nearly 60,000 people saved life .
29@@ 00 Volun@@ te@@ ers have their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make assistance in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the ci@@ vil@@ lain , which shows him at a 11 hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbols in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , however , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing of bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four versions above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ inated .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous re@@ mn@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; quoted the image his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rates is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland will only get offspring with 150 years old .
at the bottom of the North Atlantic coast at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animals acceler@@ ates at a rich 2.6 km / h - and it is half the top speed as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this of slow@@ ness @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Shel@@ ter from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist presum@@ ed that Greenland will become stone .
only the evidence were missing .
Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live in the ice @-@ sea in front of the thin@@ ly popul@@ ous co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her tim@@ pent@@ ag@@ rot@@ o sho@@ res her , as she took six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , with a transmitter .
lo@@ ot make this shar@@ ks nonetheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the ja@@ w of a young polar bears .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and are looking for car@@ c@@ ass , which can be found out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the largest 502 cm measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens emerg@@ es before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins later no more .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapons attempt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon s in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters long smallest animals , the lens core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapon , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Green@@ lan@@ ha@@ ie were in contrast to normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock stand for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland at the age of 335 , during the record @-@ Ha@@ i with 502 Zen@@ ith is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ female will only get offspring when they are more than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age with 156 years has been determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this may also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters , is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , in which bacon a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism are often living on austerity fl@@ aming .
so they mature later - and slow@@ down slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often very large .
the volume is much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it , as far as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ ack@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics around B@@ auen , the municipal at the most recent meeting has been concerned .
with relief , the committee adopted the message from Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven housing can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ zel@@ ists and closing questions are clari@@ fied , the sale of the land is placed in the residential areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) , for applicants nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers p@@ inn@@ ed in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and stock@@ pile people alike .
as announced , construction products can now be consul@@ ted in the City Hall , via the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be consul@@ ted in its September session .
in order to obtain requests concerning the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial establishments , associated with job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change its planning plan in sub @-@ areas in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of under @-@ time , this industrial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
according to the city &apos;s competition , the city of Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg will be the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ington , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a referendum , it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions within the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough to have the approval in the UK .
they just take advantage of major US banks .
several banks have announced already announced jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lobby &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is reck@@ ons with 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance list E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) established its headquarters , but this is less important to the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ oss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , but as well as in Dublin in infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt will be much easier to reach .
in addition , the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ oss .
in addition , the rent for top @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer stand up the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial stability for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; fol@@ ate the I@@ W .
but London will continue to remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite a Bre@@ xit vote .
we also speak the cro@@ lls conditions in London according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs of the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counterpart decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are eligible to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the legal costs that made its legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liberated from a damages payment of $ 200 million for violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drug S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .
in the case of the complaint on Thursday , U.S. official judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of costs , which were created during the defence of the fjord .
Mer@@ ck tries to deal with Gilead , which is gover@@ ned by the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck participated in each other def@@ endants and property on laboratory work in which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r toler@@ ate the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday in 2015 , this resulted in the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s US $ 1 million donated to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; former Foreign Minister delivered a income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster to their book about their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ique Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per was known in an opinion .
by contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and re@@ jec@@ tors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not obliged by the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for its ref@@ usal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Advisor to CNN said he did not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ umps Cri@@ tics , including the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already promised his ref@@ usal to raise questions concerning assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business seminars and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown a video on the topic and published on Friday a video on the Internet in which the high @-@ level Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump will publish his tax statement .
on Thursday they spoke the topic even during a speech to the Economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate did in the past decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ controls are become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million , earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hillary Clinton at the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ets whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , drop@@ ping to a meeting of their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control for the IRS and did not have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s Campaign has released tax declar@@ ations until the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income was relative to wages , unlike most of the Americans .
their main money invest was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire @-@ makers , dance @-@ anias Ele@@ gant protection
natural shel@@ ters in Tanzania use an Orthodox way to maintain eleph@@ ants in people living settlements - they throw con@@ doms of them filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensi@@ fied the idea , together with U.S. natural protection , trained in villages in the north of Tanzania , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stepped method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many Spe@@ akers used to defend themselves .
Friday is the phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in this con@@ greg@@ ations where they can stop the eleph@@ ants of their fields without damage the elephant , &quot; the manager of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
if it is not qu@@ en@@ ched , a so called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire plant in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lighted , the con@@ dom is placed with a pop up on and spray fine dust to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ff in the air .

Jewish director proposes Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin since it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
what is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tivity .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the intervention was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , the director left even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demands that the di@@ alling code will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
that is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this is in Germany in precisely this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident recorded a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called for a scandal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the alleged &quot; Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she named it in another post in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ bility of Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; verb@@ s &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct command , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not include the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .

students threw together on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public education system .
the police continued Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against demonstr@@ ators .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , trade rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided by the Ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , another commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noticed that the trade rate between Russia and Iran were in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representatives of around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists will be broken down in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ o@@ des@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took a role which had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend , when he stor@@ med home to hit a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory during Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after she took place in March at the London World Championships in London despite the review of Ho@@ ys a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , where they remained , when they saw potential in the gravel which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner sat down in the qualification round a Olympics , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ rests won the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des went back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y carried the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which exec@@ uting in a higher speed , to slow him down and it Kenn@@ y and especially sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
in the final round we put up an Olympic champion and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there were Hin@@ des that he fell to a weak start .
he withdrew this statement later , and there was no ob@@ jection of England ri@@ vals .
in such a superior victory there was no problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been so bad for so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect to be successful five days at the Vel@@ o@@ des@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the field of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the one of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he won two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ zation competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , won in 2012 in London , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where the Wig@@ gins will be focusing on safety .
he had fought yesterday with the qualification before the qualification , when officials called his function to measure his body size .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow and ended , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team is leaving on its strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a t@@ ar to medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute Domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
in the background , Dra@@ mas played back in the background , the resignation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s resignation in April , surrounded by sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ ers and retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , when you see the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ o@@ des@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary reputation is GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland due to energy consumption
the future of aluminium carp@@ entry from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are on the game , as the plant operators will termin@@ ate the energy supply and thereby raise all delivery contracts , as the delivered energy company hur@@ ried .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout runs for 20 years .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ ste , as the melt is approximately 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point of Henry melting , which resulted in a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ ling with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ Am Valley , shared with the fact that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller proportions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for major trading prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual ab@@ in@@ us amounting to $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the treaties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of liqu@@ or ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the melt or the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even if it is a statement , why it has re@@ signed from the contract .
analysis war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually consume about 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , San Antonio is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the latest news on its Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote for weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they have finished the cover of their sister and end with a classic turn . they have all planned a surprise @-@ party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ ee@@ zed plot almost every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of an animation on a radio station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this publi@@ city .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ aoke has started .
Kend@@ alls Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , have sm@@ itten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is for Vo@@ gue , most of the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which rather resem@@ bles a photo band as a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating that in the last two years of the magazine , pictures of the magazine are still le@@ ased out before the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Moss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , Oscar prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passage model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of its generation , is located in a good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young people from today who know how to make a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women that character@@ ise themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to anyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat different in the fashion world .
in June the lon@@ ging Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and their colleagues critic@@ ised Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called her &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ ling of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook up again , when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking on the mixed lot seems to pass by the point .
Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your prim@@ ers of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their free time it is to be seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres refer to 16@@ 0,000 people each year .
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are transported annually by municipal centres , while the industry has already taken up on the effects of other medium @-@ sized transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair Del@@ og@@ ations and the like have their request for free legal advice and legal dispute .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy , are ready for further cuts .
starting June of the next year , this legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of its federal funds .
the Director of the municipal centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council showed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be even worse after the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Queensland con@@ ges@@ tion centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and impressive debt , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems righ@@ tly and this survey shows that they may not get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means thousands of aid people from Queensland to be forced to help with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the Federal Minister of Justice and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ i as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle cuts promp@@ tly , so that people may need assistance with legal problems .
last year , the national government fulfilled her commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centres and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
the following elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) draw significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU .
this was representative surveys of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could still be reg@@ ained in the north , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would have been the strongest party and would have good chances to continue its head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and Af@@ D .
the left hand would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Green Party died in the heavy traffic day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not present with 3 percent each day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD reported only 23 percent ( 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
this means that it is still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .

e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be present today for about two sel@@ fies and high resolution .
a iPhone is now available with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros fans can buy the equipment yet on the Internet , but they come from the stone &apos;s Stone Age .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile radio manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western Germany format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reached .
even access to websites was possible by HTML brow@@ sers , even though qu@@ ir@@ ish slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found themselves .
the price was pretty proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of sales in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to know in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone numbers of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft .
nowadays the market rule , which came all much later than Nokia .
always and anywhere online , this is today for many people everyday life .
by 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone accounts for 5@@ 55 million units .
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and telecommunic@@ ations concerts .
in the meantime , around the smartphone has developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came from the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
Apple began the winner of the group today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the neighbour .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all learning the smartphone even sometimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must expand the Olympic spirit and expand in Heathrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heathrow will not only take place in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , this was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ rows , just like in 2012 in London , when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will return , by creating new possibilities for local and companies near Heathrow .
for our local communities , we have already set 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such people think that the challenge of the expansion of Heath@@ rows is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we can bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the branches had w@@ ron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to consider , but Heathrow answered each question .
like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion to funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in Heathrow , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequency test drive in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the addition of Heathrow will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and expand in Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding advertising block
for companies that earn money with on@@ line@@ money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to deal with display block@@ ers , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ spiel . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be a blo@@ g@@ post on his desktop @-@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his dis@@ co @-@ site would change the coding back on its advertising display , to identify it , which is part of the page advertising , to make it difficult to make .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is already underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has let themselves in the fight is a strong indication , such as wor@@ r@@ ying display block@@ ers for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using ad lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ v@@ c makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue .
the company has no effect on display block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , since mobile network block@@ ers have no effect on the software mobili@@ zer app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , divided a speaker with .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient great share of revenues , so Facebook is worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; ad @-@ pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them on it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adop@@ ts new filters are wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the page , which are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this does not represent positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared actors from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to lay more control in the hands of the people instead .
woman with susp@@ icious suicide on Swiss Motor@@ way over@@ ride
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles was passed on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d to midnight .
a woman lay in the Dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
it was opened to investig@@ ational procedures , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something which must decide on the prosecutor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be dra@@ gged .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in Dun@@ kl@@ en on the motorway - was decided that drivers do not have to go out that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acquitted when she had passed a man and killed one night at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne during August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice was drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the road .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman had responded to a justified way -- to justify a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street had a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday at the near of Morges should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was once more inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus can be found with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin , similar atmosphere , and nonetheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry places than de Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shake off faster ver@@ aging .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus is exp@@ on@@ ated its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io stated in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds which acts as an umbrella , to shiel@@ ds the surface of a majority of the sun@@ beds .
the result are average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution that was previously assumed by planet research .
although they were presumably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans are ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro wing withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know them today .
the researchers share the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , and led to a low participation in the decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will seek after a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as Chief Executive Vice President of the Colorado Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and whol@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the summer long and much thought I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more deep to give him more deep and to bring it to higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a joint law on decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these terms are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who was fired on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League &apos;s Best Trainer at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season .
he led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season .
the practices recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces of Montreal Canadi@@ ens and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers pick up talks again , set up strike
the labour force on the withdrawal for North Sea workers are exposed , while all the parties are set for a new talk round at the table , they spoke negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and the unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ launch the process of the current battle process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold some full day sessions in the coming weeks that will start the beginning next year to re @-@ start the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings will follow a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to companies have the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to spend its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alized as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ ens@@ ity with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower raw oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that has intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to have reinforced the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disp@@ utes , which took place in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ters of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler Wel@@ space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the observ@@ atory .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star@@ ters are rotating at different rates as well as in which context the rotary @-@ time rooms are facing the planet &apos;s planet .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relation of our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his age and even the story of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Inf@@ rared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , created around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rates , these mat@@ uring stars encounter large quantities of star@@ ters .
as these winds have to travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when an ast@@ er@@ isk , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star spot -- as s@@ ungl@@ asses .
the newest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that there are more efficient stars than fewer massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors are added to be massive , better red rot@@ ors , to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ ters of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare properties like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the p@@ inn@@ acle of the Ple@@ y@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more , like what , when and why stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ y@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star will come from
the tears ran when Alex Rodriguez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional response announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time after the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ star Game Particip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodriguez was elected to the most valuable player of the league in 2009 , he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
its signature under a ten @-@ year contract has raised 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contrac@@ tor on 31 December 2017 , he will be employed as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodriguez has paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays refer to only two bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted into the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodriguez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave him forbidden mortality in between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed down to 211 games because of an increase in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal .
Rodriguez is considered as the prime suspect , for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida performance funding .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez Rodriguez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are not no@@ isy .
during many bas@@ eball legends in their final games yet again , Rodriguez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not contain a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; corro@@ ded Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy and sympathy of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ du@@ als Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sets the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be overs@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ es .
an enlighten@@ ed athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
prior to the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ oping cou@@ plings became known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critical athle@@ tics competitions this news will come to the time .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de have been detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ quer@@ ying resources .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Chamber Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the Bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the alleg@@ ations of over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Tribunal for the CA@@ S . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IOC but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news spread over the positive specimen with Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 year old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance to act the EP@@ O &apos;s blood pressure .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended provision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial also should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow reported immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete &apos;s ath@@ ei@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not pull out the proper battles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , about all Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from Chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ra@@ ged Nation may not participate in Rio .

both the taking of taking , both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic d@@ oping op@@ es , even the L@@ äu@@ der@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier Ver@@ sions in China were also responsible for violent cl@@ ashes between the athletes .

dat@@ at@@ lau : so persistent h@@ ack@@ ers h@@ ack@@ ers her li@@ fel@@ ess
programm@@ ers of com@@ press@@ ors are currently growing up companies - and are successful thereby .
according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once at least once , partly a number of victims of a attack using Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already one of the ranks of a ran@@ som@@ ware .
40 per cent of the victims were willing , willing to use the requested money to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators Speci@@ alize their Er@@ press@@ ors Software according to the observations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential rede@@ emed lion is considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we currently watch a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still looking to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered Er@@ press@@ um Software for itself .
only private users were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ites and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the Er@@ press@@ er .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ assing Bit@@ coin .
but where at private us@@ ef@@ ulness , personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falling off , if a ran@@ som@@ ware is suggested .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to break down the business activity completely in case of danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were already threatened by attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of patient &apos;s disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure Safety researchers have examined the user &apos;s user interfaces and get the contact with the Er@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they will explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and individuals who rede@@ emed payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay too hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ites are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
the more likely , however , is that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software design to the real ar@@ press@@ ors .
the existing malware kits were created by the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Er@@ press@@ ors then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buying the set of a crimin@@ als and commissioned another way to install the software on the many PCs .
payment is made per in@@ calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well known in many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies IT developers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware by using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful inheritance , the perpet@@ rators instead of the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the damage potential according to type of data still a multiple higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could not take new goals in the internet of things to the grain in future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrate how they could get connected to their control with the internet connected thermo@@ stat .
in the middle of the winter , the c@@ lich@@ és of a der@@ mal blocked heating could definitely be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators are then instead of blocking the heating in the future a whole manufacturing road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday .
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but HR @-@ V built on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond has a lot of place , it works in no place .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and comfortable , just the cockpit @-@ top is falling down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than similar vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l , with high @-@ resolution and 10@@ 26 l in reverse @-@ folded back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be mounted as Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer a storage space that is from the floor up to the ceiling of 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk can be well @-@ loaded , but the charging height is 650 mm slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
he is likely to raise his work , however , a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine optimization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
steering is likely to be more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; does not leave any wishes .

two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly in@@ comprehen@@ sible to reach .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol station will receive from 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .

Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow on a passenger jet@@ ty
an air@@ line is not responsible for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
because a liability is possible only in danger of dangers which are typical for air traffic , the regional court ruled Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken a kne@@ e at the fall .
however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as judgment .

disease case : when paid the organizer
after their journey you can only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests may show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ate case , a family was heavily polluted with diar@@ rhoea and vomiting in the second day of their Turkish descent .
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers on a defective cl@@ auses that allegedly polluted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey was in@@ sufficient - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ ers .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the f@@ ences in fact was defective .
but the organizer was just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
especially contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the samples of water .

of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 people were killed .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the refugees of refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state needs to be sober and decided at the same time .
sure : our country will not respond to the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph will not allow terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , but the safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
he also announced another personalized ampli@@ fication of security forces , and &quot; in medium four @-@ digit mag@@ nit@@ ude of more than several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty again .
video surveillance should be improved , the arms right so improved , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet is used .
the last much @-@ discussed silence for physicians should be maintained to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , he wants to seek solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be dimin@@ ished , he said with a view of mental stress .
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be prepared better in dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
for prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ator investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the certainty to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior is clearly contrary to action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear @-@ stick for the sni@@ per in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .

better transport flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ on@@ aut regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal adjustment should be extended .
this is a good news for all the car driver , who are on the road traffic on the environment road every night when they drive over the highway ( A 43 ) .
the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler &apos;s road to 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the hammer down to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : the traffic is divided early , so the total end of the expi@@ res on the varied section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Repres@@ entation Münster @-@ West .
the passenger car on the add@@ inger nervous the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back @-@ day back the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic will only be tra@@ cked on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to record the heavy traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily st@@ ac@@ ies will not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may not say the company &apos;s business operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official remaining time to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal framework , the regional business has chosen the transport of traffic during school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools

rain instead of shooting stars : hope to improve weather
the weather has the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to fri@@ day by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad because of clouds and rain badly needed to observe the sky spectacle , the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday night tomorrow .
our hope is on the night on Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll be able to see many stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ vers@@ atility , which include 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ ters .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ seus that goes north east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , it extends for ever , at night , one is awake , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up cl@@ ing@@ ling no longer to think of sleep .
that is all other than relaxing .
after all , one has problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent emp@@ loying their sleep often or are not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are various causes underlying , empha@@ sized Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ep , member of the German Society for Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands below , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , that means an input and sleeping disorder .
just trying to sleep through many people as an uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht tells board member of the German Haus@@ Medical Association with practice in the German Haus@@ s@@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psychological , or behavi@@ our@@ al factors behind , but also medications .
not rare is the sleeping disorder any other condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is frequent above all depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ am@@ per@@ ing about everyday problems and care to greet , there is a example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep disorders ?
if you don &apos;t sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week and the day is imp@@ aired , the doctor should go .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look different differently : it is beaten , tired , in@@ ex@@ cre@@ ted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to ease the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only during acceptance and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
situated in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ente , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , one should first turn in sleeping difficulties to the Haus@@ er , says We@@ ep .
it can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should come into a sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , snor@@ ing with breath@@ ability , in illness of illness , with sickness , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of sleeping disorder , explains fi@@ xation .
we don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ gri@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after selling , one goes to bed in his normal time .
beside the electro@@ des , one is wearing a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eder in the finger .
a camera on the ceiling is also drawn .
how can the problems arise in the handle ?
there are quite many positions , where you can set for better sleep .
We@@ ep counts on : regular sleep and up@@ standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol and watch the night at night - then you will begin to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s all at all at all .
what the jun@@ ta camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought the first Gold World Championships for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protects his counterpart from his criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jun@@ ta of 150.000 € should nobody heard about lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
thus , we cannot compete with countries who do so much , and do not even operate under the subject of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had already reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
exactly how to keep it with countries .

airport : bonds of Bag@@ di@@ eben .
professional slide at the airport Düsseldorf
civilian authorities of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the suspect had been committed as a gang of several pocket and bag @-@ pil@@ es .
against 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants recognized in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men have committed several delic@@ acy since mid @-@ July and were involved in general , working and particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Code 34 can refer to the dict@@ ations of criminal charges brought to Germany , to point out four actions .
they caught a total of over 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ bauten , a couple of lenti@@ ls , in between still a rest of head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in works at first glance , but the police ranks them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
you walk along the street from east to west , one comes to playing places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
compared to a Li@@ dl , which should be demolished soon , it will be built : by 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy real estate &quot; in which the real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls you in the last weeks preferred with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents drew ten@@ dencies , but on the ground floor , however , rooms are occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year , there has been several times for a tough approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , with 300 police officers , had been pat@@ ched , according to the police three weeks ago , with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ wag@@ ons on site , sper@@ sed parts of the road and retained visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the rooms were commissioned by the unknown building owner in the unknown house owner .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the ev@@ ac@@ uation was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers came under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road affects peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about early days .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the chief of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who have been three children here , are mainly used by the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for increasing ten@@ ants and genetic disorders .
it does not sound after a &quot; Kie@@ z , who wanted to kill himself in front of the political left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner city and the police make up between household and neighbours , doesn &apos;t exist so clearly .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a lower average risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
there were also home @-@ related home projects . many houses have been occupied in the former East in 1990 , including nearly the entire mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ amer had been cleared out of a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and election lin@@ ers from around the world : with them , residents of the GDR times and former home network now share their Kie@@ z .
this also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognise them designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to paint bags .
this year , no other street was mentioned so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neighbours may look as a problem , that it is not necessarily affected by crime : criminal charges such as body inf@@ rin@@ gement , according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the crimes make tangible damage , the ten@@ ds rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house in addition to the controversial 94 years , cannot be a speech of uncertainty .
as for violence is concerned , the people in the 94 are their neighbours who don &apos;t have been that .
even the famous burning cars don &apos;t give it right away in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained .
therefore it was so important that the residents returned their street : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by un@@ fortun@@ ate new@@ buildings in former buildings , which rep@@ ose the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ent apartments that are not interesting for many of them - here are more people who are not so well maintained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can &apos;t be gu@@ thei@@ de . &quot;
but what should I do if one never listen to someone ?
there lies on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for conc@@ essions , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
who is going to be conscious should be aware of - just like someone who is moving in a pub area to compl@@ ain about noise .
everyone only asked with pre@@ sur@@ names to be asked , not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in the integration and organizer .
besides , she is a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
social education supports the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group for refugees , administration , authorities and who else or else .
Reg@@ ine Client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the ei@@ ving wool mil@@ der , which has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cked as much rather to the multitude of un@@ desire application areas - meant , as the administration wanted to write the passage .
a administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the area of social work , just an ei@@ ving wool mil@@ der .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
especially in the organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place to be limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le ambition and full @-@ government players are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new container in the Was@@ en@@ straße soon
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you need to accommodate refugees in own or rented apartments .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations , must carry the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ lord &apos;s Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his flat .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto , the administration takes place no private apartments .
it does not work so far , either to rely on private apartments as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be found , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container is positioned in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only apartments are not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house sters , do profit @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ne@@ at@@ ly , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
it hopes that work for the community is to be a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but work doesn &apos;t mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a demon@@ ic feeling .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with local and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here the administration and honorary volunteers are also jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes and they can make the time sensible bridges , for example with language courses .
those who want to develop the feeling of evolution , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , will not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
there is also problem cases , but the customer says hon@@ estly , &quot; People , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do both have fear of radic@@ alization and radic@@ alization , even in a small church such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a nai@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could , but would not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these inci@@ dents also be subject to the refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main - and volunteers must watch out locally and in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .

&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already fast@@ ed to integrate the previous people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
however , when people are in need to help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
