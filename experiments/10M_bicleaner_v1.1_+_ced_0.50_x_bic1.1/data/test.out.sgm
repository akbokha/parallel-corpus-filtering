<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent TTP's trade agreement - we want to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential targets are due to the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">This, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, claimed trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive regulators massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said against it: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would increase for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invests, Trump and Clinton say almost wortequal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly denied by the nationalist Teen wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on trump, there may be parties involved in internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearer are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal extraction in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible to exporting the territory by the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies with their investment program, and urges: "one country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the gliazifish trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the U.S. do not want to isolate the international trade, but just protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton said.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hungry wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What if you want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, trump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizen wants to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics follow him, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the rich man wants to pay more tax, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as minderous and abstened in case of serious abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is estimated that around 90 percent of women living in the Munich housing are traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy members of the Assistencaries have called for their union to approve new workers with their disputes within a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot defend me of intruction that Ankara will want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was classy and he was hardly heat of warmth, even for its restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better will improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper stated that Erdogan had never heard that it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin radiant, sustainable cows showed that the state of State of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian battle ship at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow in response to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen Russia into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even greater, as it was committed by a thought friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrauen is going to build up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, when the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse for President Erdoğan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire lie clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily all friends who can get, after spending the last month during a failed coup d "état close to his amber.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter winged, which accounts for several million Russian tourists every year on the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the television budget predicted fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, since it was in response to the attempted power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persistent Groll pass through the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike that it is to reduce the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of U.S. won a bonus in Ankara with security that he requested after the attempted coup d "état support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's well noticed for Moscow is a self understandable, which itself has a deeply sitting fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glancing palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of Foreign lateral": two countries that have cast off the West and will feel bad now.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public propitiation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but to support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "it could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference, both presidents at the press conference said that they didn't even striped that issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispaster, the NATO member of Turkey foss the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least again.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Bank has since distanced itself since then, when she had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During this time brand name "RBS" have been used to protect other final consumer marks.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she decided to push more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but is not initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange rate to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are others, smaller brands for the private customer, which will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB is being employed at our Investors" brand as well as the brand, among which our employees will be busy as we now get more to a bank of brands. "</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not pursuing a global goals, but will pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these stamps will be completely different in its own congregations for something completely different and our staff will work among these trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that there will be his Six Nations Sponsoring no longer, and that it will increase the perceptibility of different brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus on inside (we have asked) to make this to a better bank for customers?" said the Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these stamps again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transportation affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin is said that Putin has ordered without giving reasons" "" "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is (in Russian), that he later became the head of the government and head of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State regarding legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his followers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for Soviet Intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff has returned to their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the scorn for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows this.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was praised as a potential President, once again wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you to do this very complicated post in early 2012 - you could almost say - complying for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin in former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once upon Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia following Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin had to reject his constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, approaching ally's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was prime minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a finicky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>

<seg id="12">A new urban housing project program, which will cost millions and will have to be financed, should provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there is still no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">Investors want to make investors as a few regulations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage boys and child are not going outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about to get people from the sofa to get active.</seg>
<seg id="5">Initially, the time on the screen was on TV set, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activity will not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I also refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards and other Spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture decreased slightly ahead of the game's publication in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon go longer users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones go out and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase of steps which returns the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, followed by the Washington Post, announced that within two days after market launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw material for performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public relations campaigns for health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes time" "" "to be active" "" "from the sofa" "" "and" "" "rely on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances to get to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors to make them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health will be covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is a shortened game corrupters, which always have to complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone may walk towards a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier could follow our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its appeal and use the use of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activites in the real world and will be able to help people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I wanted to introduce myself under the women's Olympic Debut and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the head of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one Afro-American woman among women.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymtikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was awarded the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won the gold medal for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manners member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport species, but you can't see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality is that Turns sees a more expensive sport and gymnasts in the first line of private gyms that are maintained by parents, which will cost the training, set-up, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are situated in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner receive its entire training and this is a devilful and long lasting commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both of having started their athlete since they began with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a performance and easier accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable hotels in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispani) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high quality turbines, which make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and confidentiality for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Turns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real picture of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympics team and thank you so many young girls are motivated by different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler undernourished his immune system and Würgereflex in a serious test - by turning some of the most polluted and most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel gate Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabed its wake to a Euro bill, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a washing knob of a tractor toilette as well as a public phone in Russia to provide the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before removing any object, he used a luminometers to show and show us what it will be possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to cut the rinse button on a tractor fan, which has already been used by thousands of other things, may actually be repulsive, but actually in a kitchen sptry more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its Darms by travelling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to train stations up to rust of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he told: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slag."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just the case for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he denied was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sampling showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their luminous number 4000 units, while freshly washed hands a weight of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel agent "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes the worst thing I've got into a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing better than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to swallow here, because it is ingenious here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company was buried Mr. Wright with valio vasilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is intriguing at the same time and, at the same time, explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy Brainstormings that ended with that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way of information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of things I have directed to him, as the ekigmatic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring to Ian, to stimulate them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats in movies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally products containing the lactic lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the land.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">From 2021, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the swiss parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far it is not so far: summer holidays, heat and land fight - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the campaigns they are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers that hang up posters, balloons, flyers, and gather at the end of the votes cast out only mühevoll.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last holiday-day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave a campaign of just close to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, when you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly neuling AfD cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition of coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, has gained almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees of his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, spread roses and chat a bit with people, as it did already his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel to grandparents Angela Merkel; Merkel Parliamentary Group is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern.</seg>

<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeastern CDU abstain largely on the usual campaign events on market places and shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloon.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so Kokert, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that you have to crumble the basis that she needs to be very strict, again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are, like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely present in the land of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU electoral fighting is also self-larvingly: "you must go there, where the people are doing, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD to an especially dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, S & Ds were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD clearly won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, would be able to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are making a modern virtue, and put their campaign in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," it is known as Claudia Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fighting continues to settle for local stimulus among holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a superb team.</seg>

<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south on the weekend, until the end of October everything will be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is also commendowed to the building, for example, when it comes to set up the facility.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday moved to the South and also the lock of Aspergstraße was lifted in Ofterdingen and thus also the connection to Rottenburg are again relaxed, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic by the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partly significant complaints," says the vice-deputy management of the rehabilitation management of Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachar Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scarves were seeking and more to their Navi confided as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that mancher trucks appeared in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limit has not been observed, the community has strengthened the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excess," says King, who made himself a location on the location.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been littered.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest one was on the pace of 77 kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, but it became quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small solace that for customers from Rottenburg are now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-restoration has led to revenues in sales, each one wonders to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have to do with the "end customers" so much for other companies, for which the restoration has hardly consequences.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existenthreatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants I met "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers are missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="36">Instead, the president Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation to be answered with the hint that the restaurant will benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B. now they also need the disadvantages caused by the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other country circles, where so anything funding was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all sounds, Göhner is sure that its restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has already been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, other regular guests are now likely to understand less frequently due to the complicated transport trousers.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you do not go down, it's also different.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>

<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière will have a little time away before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">Partly, de Maizière starts a second suit for suggestions, who had not yet to do with the SPD: he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under sentence and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "that will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "dream of the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "he still keep this anyway for reasonable and demanding nothing, which I have no chances of the coalition partner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are partly in itself: it plans fast procedures for shifts and more possibilities for partakings of people in front of the deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that are targeted targeted in the country are to check out their smartphones and make social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">At Dulings for up asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or their papers consciously throwing their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also works even unbalanced and makes questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - at the imtreatment of Gedser for example - the question arises: what does it mean to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be found in speech that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are also many people in view of high refugee concerns around the safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things, which people deeply busy, were not able to claps themselves in election events.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous ably in the focus.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties went high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garnish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, where the Ressorchefs also call a Burka ban and a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also blossoms here to reconcile sounds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel cars, prices increase worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it does not run in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response, there is a concept for the call.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen launches the following deliveries into the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car park can continue to show an increase in the previous year despite its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW weakened the overall sales brand in Western Europe and loaded with the overall sales, as announced in the Dax company.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the brand sold 449100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, following China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany spent the deliveries by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Market leader Jürgen Stackmann led the weakest figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there has been in some core markets through "modified economic conditions" to maintain a purchase.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote was stressed out of the EU to exit the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the emissions affectant first escalated, there is also a Minus to beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">A large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to climb through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only one output of 0.9% is available to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group CEO Fred Kappler could continue to report a sales splash from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to rearmament into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the rearmament, Volkswagen reaffirmed that the reconstruction of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After conversion of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine capacity was no deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car park covers the customer after conversion a "guaranteed loan" certificate, but do not speak of a "guarantee," as it was called on Friday in the company.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason be legal fine.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" Focus "" "" "Focus" "" "reports Volkswagen to its German clients now a guarantee for diesel models." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW representative in the federal state ministry.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Commerce it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has successfully completed the issues of my investigation committee and KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations are not accepted," stated by the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has acquired the guarantee that in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power after rearmament, no deterioration, and all typical vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself used the term "guarantee," but not as it was in business divisions.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers would come to a workshop half a year after converting about with an engine damage to a workshop, and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also, in customer interest, it is important to avoid that there is any damage to do with any damage caused by the gassal scandal, with respect to possible guarantees, as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely male middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to divide it under the pseudonym nonAlleEinsamic ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most likely resurrection of sound plates does not want to be on a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record recently, all previews are between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older platters retain their feelings rather to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I stand in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and a wild striving before I stand, my hands hold and something determinant of the story like: "so let's take a look at a close look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart rate SoHos slowly comes to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers are located - there is a handful fantastic record specialist.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops, and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men mean age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by my home), dressing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records, which he was not able to buy, when she was sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70ies that appeared as I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy records, rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and let it take to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the talks, which I have led, people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records sold to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to followers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica, to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of equestors.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to return to the stability of familiar sound platforms, from objects that are happy jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "we are a staff of an turntable." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record the last month they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntable.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I blasted through a stack to Bossa Nova computations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone first came here and said," "" "I have no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate, so I can add them to the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are the younger people, not elderly, who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop, which has dedicated the sound plates nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience when I am going to clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, Teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesiology and sexshaken pop instead of experimental jazz drumers - it is good to see such diversität in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naging psychic traumata are hard, if one stands for someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the business and viewed the Varietes for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a mannequin than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so the collecting of plates does not represent real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a crazy grofzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers. Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the certificate that jeans prefer a group of young Teenagers, I was watching a group of young Teenagers, who for a moment to buy polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at them - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the person that is most of the luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree that, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, turnaround and in onlineages exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety with the bummeln by record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while starring the eyes of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain during the 7-year rugby came in the final on Thursday night to a corrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 in the deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji it distributed a master class in the handling, side stepping, back, line run and roher power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the non-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, in this form, Fiji had beaten a 15-man team in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one day tomorrow a gold medal for his neck will be hanging: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at Adelaide Seville.</seg>
<seg id="10">She only lost one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the GBS out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when you run in driving buses. the World Series winner went down 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau settled in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB is scared to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hype of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa stopped to achieve a third gate, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua lete a touch down and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the resanpfiff and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou premapped through a further weak tacklings of GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had to be born to play 7, while GB was still left.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time by and lock the fever gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favour of the South sealans, whose fans sang and dumps on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-door with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle, the Fijis embraced and crushed and crushed in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a half-finalmatch from the racing - British transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footprint and scored a gate among the position in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late late tackling TacWatson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side teams, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no engine of gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 tough Hieve who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it were only those who sat on the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when she went to the second Olympics in a row without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports that had such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39.15 unprotected deployment, which is also an example of an example.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that reflect on the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing, a battalion that contribute to concrement progress made the difference, and no one was not ilable than the trainer, which would not survive this day, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, what the interruption was at a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the unceability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who had a nerstinctive morning to spend some more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning who was a leader in the Royal Artillery regiment in action in Afghanistan," "" "I was an emotional wreck for this week. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much me this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so there's a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to coaching or wish a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very close at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">A couple will take time for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I would not say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter Anime is inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitive against races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it makes Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unversioned, autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million selfies defies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All errors will arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of propagating the app Blackface and white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week struck a filter, which gave them slums, false teeth and faded cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowout."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversy raised to a bigger problem, that the company has diversatility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely circulated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outside standing, the rents have experienced, reminded the filter in violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others have opted for the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an E-Mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets have been widely distributed over the photos that the filter was "infringing and least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not compatible, but that the yellow-sighted is drawn up to the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all keep in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big crowd of young people - who are versed in the race as their older opponent - could rather go out, sensitivity to expect.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of snapshots are a picture that is created for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things were unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer, decided to delete their Snapchat account for others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a phone interview for medium and in a telephone interview she said that her-related controversy would reflect a lack of diversität in the setting practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the big part white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that mostly has left the Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers to ensity its workforce and points to its status as private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but according to a speaker, the company has recently set up a staff responsible, focusing on subordinated population groups and internal integration environments.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said therefore, that she will be closed all of their Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="7">Management errors in CentCom date up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct references to change reports that government pointed out under Obama, shows how analysts were subjected to pressure from their presides, an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the Congress clearly stated as the facts," presented the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom minority was publicly announced that a military regression of Mossuls will begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." he said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas, in a position.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigation will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Defence Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news conference held on Thursday their own findings, agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a superior process for the preparation of subsequent assessments in Isil and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest ranking Democrat in Komoree, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. ship.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of subsequent reports," did the morality under analysts and "delivered a little space for different opinions."</seg>

<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which were recorded following complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>

<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a written font in Iraq, looked at the consequences of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection of the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team decided to establish Mr. Hooker according to the government's declaration that the refineries of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this recognition was not published, but the Times reported in September.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a Rasender squadrant between competition and Streets.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, from the wristbands to swimmers to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch to the television, read a paper or listen to the chat on your neighbor in the waiting shop, without Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womens of black with dimples, could certainly be sent under this well-known name that would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fes.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are sports, which are not generally accepted: aerial pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me get your attention on the discrete charm of trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney the last 16 years has been so spicious, that many of whom I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though the US athletes sent to competition, it has never gained a medal in trampoline jumping and had a athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain outer side charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear fit for a clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end tilting - but also the Grazie of the Turnhalle and Tauchens, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "jump board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must take a range of falling movements (turning, hgenuine and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to an official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-round athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists hoping to go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes go and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV transmission also another cavity: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented streben is noisy, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir up an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at the watch of these games as a bit tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atorient.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumped off, seemingly heavier as an astronaut, go down, then down to the top, then effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no Wolves into the distance, just the dreaming, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, on the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men were on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will oversee in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by anxiety and objective of male athletes - like the male U.S. Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police in failure.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid network of Western Europe with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months, protests against the government depleted against the country and spread to more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unruthless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen were fighting against unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, some videos on the protests, probably from the last or early this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a towel against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Agency for Human Rights demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country and will even become more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in the remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendlerite in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia had everything else than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissidents were effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you press people and do not have any other options except for protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in the Ethiopian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protesters.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from ground use to digging in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread vote, last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a battle for those tender, controversial line resulted in hundreds of life in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, could benefit the turbulence and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitration after years ago explode in the surface explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, because cheaper smartphones have been more frequently and improved by Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still communicate via Internet Proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them to protests as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not the natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äonen, Amharas, who come from ethopaens, mainly Christian floods, are living in politics and economics while living the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in lowland regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are there to coordinate under a screen," "" "Mulatu Gemechu said, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-publique illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed in it, to perceive early signs of discontent and special contractors to process opponents, and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental cause," "" "Mr Abdi said, a conflict management." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to increase the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of NordEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many feared that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested that according to the analyst of analysts apparently expelled by the government and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following razors, many protesters have been killed, even though it were less than in the past months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts predict Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this does not intensify the intensification of the internal misconceptions of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharan city, led by Tigray, and hatred toward the Tigray will always be more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the U.S. and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenue over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to be merged in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy that his campaign announced that his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions concerning communication skills of the Republicans on whether he is capable of communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow countrymen who endeavouring to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the original position, which he could not mean.</seg>

<seg id="14">In late July, he drew strong criticism of himself when he said the Russians, Mrs. Clinton's emails, however, said later, "Of course I said the sarcastically."</seg>

<seg id="18">Instead of defuse the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump adopted an even corrosive tone as its refractory values have gone back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a big advantage in the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse for his provocative statements, he is accused of understanding his critics, to discaring his testimony, or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal Mitstreiter into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of what provokant may be his testimony.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of the American kitchen, has become a rare serrated luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland will only get offspring with 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the bottom of the North Atlantic coast at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he comes on average just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animals accelerates at a rich 2.6 km / h - and it is half the top speed as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of slowness-shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commented Alexander Shelter from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist presumed that Greenland will become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence were missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live in the ice-sea in front of the thinly populous coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they appear in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timpentagroto shores her, as she took six animals in front of Svalbard, with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nonetheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and are looking for carcass, which can be found out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens emerges before the birth of the sharks, which contained in the proteins later no more.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of Carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapons attempt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon s in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimeters long smallest animals, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapon, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Greenlanhaie were in contrast to normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock stand for a 493 cm long Greenland at the age of 335, during the record-Hai with 502 Zenith is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-female will only get offspring when they are more than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age with 156 years has been determined, Greenland haie with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, in which bacon a 120-year-old harpoon pointed, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism are often living on austerity flaming.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slowdown slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it, as far as many offspring as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Schacklein." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies grew strongly in the country, divided by the Ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies take existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to make access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, another commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noticed that the trade rate between Russia and Iran were in the first five months of the year 2016 by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, and $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports increased by 91.5 percent in Iran and totalled $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade show was reached by deliveries of machines, agricultural vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign representatives of around 35,000 Visas, primarily travel from Reisevisas to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries, which concerns the tourist number in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">One could say that the record number of Iranian tourists will be broken down in Russia from the last year, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only few Russians are visiting Iran, something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally can recommend visiting the towns Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminium carpentry from Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are on the game, as the plant operators will terminate the energy supply and thereby raise all delivery contracts, as the delivered energy company hurried.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria early this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout runs for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are standing on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominoste, as the melt is approximately 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point of Henry melting, which resulted in a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of long speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplied the large aluminium meltling with its Loy Yang A power plant in LatAm Valley, shared with the fact that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller proportions.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts" "" "securing transactions" "", "which should have been into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for major trading prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual abinus amounting to $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said the decision to book the treaties, the" "" "ability of liquor..." "" "to ensure the melt or the power supply to the melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into force from November this year, even if it is a statement, why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysis warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume about 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>

<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile radio manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously on the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the western Germany format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers, even though quirish slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">A small keyboard and a black-and-white screen found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of sales in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to know in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone numbers of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nowadays the market rule, which came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and anywhere online, this is today for many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">By 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices, on Samsung and Apple alone accounts for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the well-running business of countless app providers and telecommunications concerts.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, around the smartphone has developed a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came from the beginning of 2007, then the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He spoke three instruments in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communications, easy to use with touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple began the winner of the group today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">We now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is 20 years after its invention.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud to midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the Dark Ones "in an act of despair" on the road and were taken by several cars, the police said in Waadt.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years, which was driven by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was once more inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus can be found with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin, similar atmosphere, and nonetheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry places than de Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and shake off faster veraging.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus is exponated its daily side of the sun almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds which acts as an umbrella, to shields the surface of a majority of the sunbeds.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously assumed by planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably inhabitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years, was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans are evaporated and its water vapor was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydro wing withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know them today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers share the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Welspace telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the observatory.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope to learn more about the relation of our results with other starters, more about the relationship between the mass of a dying, his age and even the story of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomites and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the Crypassing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where at private usefulness, personal photo database is on the game, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falling off, if a ransomware is suggested.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to break down the business activity completely in case of danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already threatened by attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of patient's disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Don't pay, you only encourages the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure Safety researchers have examined the user's user interfaces and get the contact with the Erpressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They will explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And individuals who redeemed payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay too hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky profits from the ransomites are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The more likely, however, is that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software design to the real arpressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The Erpressors then look for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, buying the set of a criminals and commissioned another way to install the software on the many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per incalculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well known in many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT developers in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomware by using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful inheritance, the perpetrators instead of the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage potential according to type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could not take new goals in the internet of things to the grain in future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon, security researchers demonstrate how they could get connected to their control with the internet connected thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the clichés of a dermal blocked heating could definitely be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then instead of blocking the heating in the future a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, it extends for ever, at night, one is awake, in the morning it is far from the wake-up clingling no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent employing their sleep often or are not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are various causes underlying, emphasized Hans-Günter Weep, member of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands below, but is the Insomnie, that means an input and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just trying to sleep through many people as an unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht tells board member of the German HausMedical Association with practice in the German HaussSaxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychological, or behavioural factors behind, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder any other condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is frequent above all depression," "" "says Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts blampering about everyday problems and care to greet, there is a example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week and the day is impaired, the doctor should go.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look different differently: it is beaten, tired, inexcreted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to ease the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only during acceptance and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Situated in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fiente, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first turn in sleeping difficulties to the Hauser, says Weep.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should come into a sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory physician, for example, snoring with breathability, in illness of illness, with sickness, or if you don't find the cause of sleeping disorder, explains fixation.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make a lunch," "" "says Figrids." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">How can the problems arise in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many positions, where you can set for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weep counts on: regular sleep and upstanding times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol and watch the night at night - then you will begin to calculate immediately, and that's all at all at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbauten, a couple of lentils, in between still a rest of headstone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first glance, but the police ranks them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>

<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which should be demolished soon, it will be built: by 2017, there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy real estate" in which the real estate company Friedrichshain calls you in the last weeks preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents drew tendencies, but on the ground floor, however, rooms are occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year, there has been several times for a tough approach to the police against the project, the area called "No-Go Zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, had been patched, according to the police three weeks ago, with 30 to 40 officials and three team-wagons on site, spersed parts of the road and retained visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the rooms were commissioned by the unknown building owner in the unknown house owner.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers came under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road affects peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about early days.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the chief of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, who have been three children here, are mainly used by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for increasing tenants and genetic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a "Kiez, who wanted to kill himself in front of the political left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner city and the police make up between household and neighbours, doesn't exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also has a lower average risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were also home-related home projects. many houses have been occupied in the former East in 1990, including nearly the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstreamer had been cleared out of a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and election liners from around the world: with them, residents of the GDR times and former home network now share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the rents, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognise them designed slices or freshly painted facades, which were subjected to paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">This year, no other street was mentioned so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbours may look as a problem, that it is not necessarily affected by crime: criminal charges such as body infringement, according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the crimes make tangible damage, the tends rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house in addition to the controversial 94 years, cannot be a speech of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence is concerned, the people in the 94 are their neighbours who don't have been that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars don't give it right away in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigaer street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the residents returned their street: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by unfortunate newbuildings in former buildings, which repose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominient apartments that are not interesting for many of them - here are more people who are not so well maintained," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can't be gutheide."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if one never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There lies on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for concessions, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="38">Who is going to be conscious should be aware of - just like someone who is moving in a pub area to complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">Everyone only asked with presurnames to be asked, not to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social education supports the team of management by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group for refugees, administration, authorities and who else or else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now, the eiving wool milder, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked as much rather to the multitude of undesire application areas - meant, as the administration wanted to write the passage.</seg>
<seg id="9">A administrative building with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the area of social work, just an eiving wool milder.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially in the organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes, as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place to be limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle ambition and full-government players are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New container in the Wasenstraße soon</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations, must carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landlord's Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his flat.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration takes place no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, either to rely on private apartments as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be found, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container is positioned in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only apartments are not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, training courses, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house sters, do profit-profit work - and that motivates and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community is to be a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But work doesn't mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a demonic feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with local and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here the administration and honorary volunteers are also jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes and they can make the time sensible bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who want to develop the feeling of evolution, he could not work in Urbach, will not work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is also problem cases, but the customer says honestly, "People, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do both have fear of radicalization and radicalization, even in a small church such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what a naive naïve may call." "" "a residual risk could, but would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also be subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks bring them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and volunteers must watch out locally and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly answer, the politics shy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already fasted to integrate the previous people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, when people are in need to help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
