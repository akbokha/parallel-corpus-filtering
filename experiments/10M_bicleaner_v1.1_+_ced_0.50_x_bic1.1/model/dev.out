Obama recommends Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not a friendly community .
the two wanted an agreement on the implementation of the international agreement , as well as Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting point , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution should also be discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington has critici@@ zed the continuing housing assembly of Israel and raises its lack of will at peace process .
due to the deal struck by Obama in order to deterior@@ ate the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ing .
in March , Netanyahu had given a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront of Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an ob@@ itu@@ ary , Professor Sh@@ annon lamb told a slightly z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police , that he shot his friend and that he would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relatives of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house these officials found the bodies of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note that I wanted to do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that we had traveled to the school grounds in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , where he travelled to school grounds for 300 miles , where he shot and killed another popular history law , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Hamburg will have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb had made the fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when police seized him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the viewers at the two ends of the state published details , as also what students and staff who knew him , said it helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , he did not have the history of violence or criminal history .
he himself spoke to a book from him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; which he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ set in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ines to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don be@@ avers , who gave up the Lamb , said he seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to treat health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest amendments to the university &apos;s employment policy that the promotion , for which lamb had worked hard for the lamb , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to work as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he caught nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb cannot answer any more .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later when he entered the Mississippi River Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he was arrested , stab@@ bing himself by a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the entry .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she thinks he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
he extended his work at the university in 2009 , which began to 3.500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing companions took him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla L@@ oo@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with common friends .
she and her friends were at High School , and he was the cool old guy , who tried several years to bring her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of the wh@@ ore at that time .
all girl melted away when he was there , &quot; said Cle@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously a few times together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house which ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter had now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came into a summer @-@ fair market three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and sings their own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a volunteer nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light up bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished reading and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night at night 5 September after the lamb had finished his guitar and mouth har@@ p .
there were no indications that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we stayed in@@ denti@@ fied and comfor@@ ted together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ ester .
Schmidt , the dead professor , managed the 1st semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , &quot; Don &apos;t Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , where he was president of his bro@@ therhood and students .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the demonstration station during the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that lamb made the emergency doctor after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb had described P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s as his wife , but there is no indication of having married the two has been married .

she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat is empty beside me and it is gradually clear that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon , Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , said his reply to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen@@ ed by violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .

ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity during the crisis of the crisis in Syria , which they proved to be demonstrated by nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Re@@ qu@@ int@@ ments that the Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously treated .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top speeds from p@@ olls in the p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ uls .
of course it is too early in the electoral term .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stressed that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had taken lead to the rise of Herman Cain , but none of them only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside saw such as J@@ eb &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ umps holding through failure and start to run their dollar , to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current change values , which suggests that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary stage :
cad@@ ence approval have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republican @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l saw positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 republi@@ cs have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa showed that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ torate Go@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump than candidates .
in a CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would &quot; off@@ end &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates some of the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans sees tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump refused to be har@@ med for the bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the voters think that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation state of State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively run his position , and nearly six out of 10 Independent States say his tem@@ per does not leave the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republican voters get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the idea .
when they set their money @-@ friendliness , republi@@ can voters hold a pl@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say , according to a CNN / OR@@ C pol@@ l from the last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since that time , when four of ten by the end of July you put money on J@@ ill Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters didn &apos;t have the most clear crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the past financial cycle , four out of ten republi@@ cs wanted , that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination to win only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will watch out more plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered for another candidates , Tr@@ ump kills nearly everyone .
some experts refer to that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field possibly contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support will be spread to more than a dozen others candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump and majority of others .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , which strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ race .
the vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters will support them that they have recorded their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say that never change my mind .
46 per cent said they let the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have made their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 republi@@ can say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign had been called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign in front of two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public dis@@ course was on the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some of them are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic rush are removed from the pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans by the Republican Party , and re@@ activate the re@@ orientation effort .
but following the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans agree that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration above the government climbed for new high@@ s .
meanwhile , around half of the support of republi@@ can voters , namely Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , can be found mainly through their out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mont@@ noon survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they &apos;re mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa - two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo beach is the most expensive apartment with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows which specific locations will cost one square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top housing , however , one of the prices are in front of the price as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German home sites - with square met@@ rics at the dizz@@ ying high@@ s .
there are several ten thousand euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located only once more at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream starting thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
second go@@ al@@ guard in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply run a race .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way for a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze brought a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hex@@ ag@@ ons of Pi@@ raeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ ze matches ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received by his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ ver of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , who made a f@@ lange thought of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ hot fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without gloss@@ y .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavarian was un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they would be brave , with their evident efforts , but often to inv@@ inci@@ ble work .
the attacks were often accompanied by playing varieties on Left @-@ outside Douglas Costa , which has rarely been tra@@ ded against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate from the right , when his flan@@ k arrived from the right hemisphere at the left @-@ top gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms of Ide@@ as Brown beat the head of the Pol@@ es ( 26 ) .
then , by direct loading , the Tor@@ wart Roberto is par@@ ked by the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bayern moved their usual lon@@ ely game , Pi@@ raeus could settle it .
but to go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel New , however , was betra@@ yed .
so for instance , when he gave a shot of ideas on the lat@@ te of the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola added a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems in the ca@@ des , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had only given the green light at the closing event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Sam@@ mer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different , this is v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided in the first change when he brought the King@@ sley com@@ an to be eliminated from Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later it was clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller again sat on it .
before the game , it was celebrated in the stadium to T@@ ie .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ ted Bavaria @-@ fans in her spect@@ ator block was apparently the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus having words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went up with stri@@ pping against the Munich p@@ endants .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was taken off from the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes , has an increased risk to lose teeth
whoever smo@@ kes , does not harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this will be close to a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in Ver@@ zi@@ cht , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a considerably increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several contribut@@ ors from the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking in smokers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , in order to get the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 ly F@@ ate higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes of dental out@@ age , cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the link between smoking and teeth are therefore going back to smoking bars in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , however , smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking at smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , researchers wrote in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take over ten years , until the threat comes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , first @-@ au@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University Birmingham .
it is necessary to convince people to be non @-@ smoking , declared teacher H@@ einer Boeing &apos;s Boeing : &quot; they are scar@@ c@@ ely shortened the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as good dental health to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by cont@@ act@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E par@@ ted .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking is increasing the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP a new court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system over the planned Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private trade facilities for disp@@ utes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system , which is significantly more traditional cu@@ isines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the EU @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström before Presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pig had decided to bring the proposal to the European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP should be the largest trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current refer@@ ral actions can be seen specifically to select the EU states and the US together independent judges for a new investment climate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be subject to equal parts from the EU , USA and third countries .
is scheduled for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
so far , the pro@@ ced@@ ural forces agreed to arbit@@ rator , a claim against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long run , she wants to work according to an international investment court .
there could , for example , could also be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration Proce@@ dures ( IS@@ DS ) is considered to be one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the companies in damages of tax pay@@ ers , national law , or obtain a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
the first @-@ hand @-@ recorded anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act submitted proposals for the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised especially that it is not for the already handled free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major progress .
in the spring of 2011 , the Commission was considering the significant points acquired by the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring of other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private bit@@ ration would be from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .

delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ pchart , which has recorded the shy folk singer on the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks with various places he always shows on the map , wor@@ ding his mines and z@@ art arranged songs .
where they were created , and what it looks like there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has grown as a wonderfully creative irrit@@ ant .
with the third and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear to be wise , very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always be able to drift at any time .
it develops the report that the@@ Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ bi@@ ous series : each of the 50 states that should be detected in a row .
but in 2004 and the Rh@@ en@@ ish already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and a positive rise of expectations .
Stev@@ ens re @-@ occurs here .
live is playing guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician will come back to the series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a widely acc@@ laimed masterpiece in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ b@@ ord@@ ing ideas and cl@@ assy fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly ranking list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves as a very extensive electronic ver@@ ware in &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth note studio album is still largely orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all the effect and hall .
the smaller clubs got away long ago , shows the stage shows for the colorful extravag@@ anza of ne@@ on @-@ forehead bands and large fluorescent stages .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band in Germany .
in a dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
Theater shows mainly the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; since March .
even though nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens went back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can cause it to throw the &quot; sla@@ b in the bottom . &quot;
only after a en@@ core Stev@@ ens would like to thank him , plays acou@@ sti@@ cally few older songs and wor@@ ries themselves under Tuscan applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ bu@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ as
since its election , Mr Cor@@ bu@@ ster &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister is eag@@ erly a@@ waited
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ n shall make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ as for the first time and David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n will ex@@ alt themselves to make the first of its six proposed questions short , whereby its performance from the media is likely to be insp@@ ected by the media and the Labour MPs out of the area .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could safely ski@@ p some meetings to leave his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns , because she comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ qu@@ ett and his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several fron@@ ts stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man from Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism around the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader , advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , regardless of its belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve to Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns , and they are called on differences between the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as a leader .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may pile up within Labour &quot; as well as Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns utter@@ ances on the position of the European Union and the limitation with certainty .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , for Labour change to be able to remove all the idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and retirement plans that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to cut down 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Socialist leader , Prime Minister David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different political approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front to con@@ front , and that he is under@@ lined both &quot; perc@@ us@@ ability &quot; and the stre@@ wing with resistance , and to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs , is represented by him when he is not participating - for example if Mr. Cameron is on his way abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues occasionally seize the Word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ se , the speaker of the House of Commons in order to discuss the problem .
when he became the leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he was playing in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; who is often associated with the parliamentary elections of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted he has failed .
when she was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire was considered the main bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership among his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that they had become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

pounds rising through accelerated growth growth in the United Kingdom
the pound so@@ ared towards data that show an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller for the FT@@ SE 100 .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and en@@ acted ass@@ essments at the time of an increase in interest rate .
the pound has increased by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the purchase offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Bur@@ berry shares were much higher following the competi@@ tor ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.9 % in accordance with encouraged news of the competition .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - bring growth again .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining industry said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share of sale as part of its strategy of debt .
the shares of packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sachs had its estimate for the company rating on &quot; sale . &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % , after the pre @-@ tax result had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power would compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Met@@ cash starts with ground@@ breaking campaign to fight Ebola collapse
Met@@ cash tries to protect IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Metall@@ cash has launched a ma@@ stur@@ b@@ acy campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen metals and IG@@ A supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers are on board , made by brands such as iron ore S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ un@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owners to sell to faithful customers for the South Australian soccer league .
it is expected to publish a further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol , and devices will be le@@ ased its annual Investor strategy .
there is much on the game , because South Australia and Western Australia usually comprise nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A accounts and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern nations .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts predi@@ ct that Morgan Stanley is expected to take out about five percent of food market shares in these two countries after opening its first markets , but primarily to take away independent individual sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley told that IG@@ A @-@ Individu@@ al will lose $ 360 million per year and $ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed costs may cost around $ 13 million of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , metal market shares are losing market share in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley is increasing that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in food and market by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash dis@@ solves to react openly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food@@ stuffs and food trade , which accounted for about 1,200 IG@@ A retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in relation to sales and mar@@ gins .
however , whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will pile up more than 150 million $ to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A single retailers in improving their shops by faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief Executive leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing is to be excav@@ ated at Elan , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth in 2017 again for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Institute Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for its behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the shortest temp@@ est around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ved the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for its own behavior .
co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; and became the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA on the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati , we soon had to get rid of Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice through refer@@ ees , with Harrison sum@@ mon@@ ed &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA &quot; and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f beat a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles qualifying behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m rather exhausted , is the fact that after my view of Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat as he lost to the US Open because of a tie in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has become extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he &apos;s never working with the other players , he &apos;s never working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very strong and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also made the decision to take into account the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to everyone , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has made the way forward to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray , he gets in the eyes of the public and he deserves to make him comprehen@@ sible to make him understand the consequences of its action . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the squ@@ ad and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , holds refugees
Hungary explains the emergency and bol@@ ted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to reach illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants acted in a Ni@@ em@@ bro@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials responded with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were used for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built and settled there .
but fru@@ strations got up .
when a police helicopter ho@@ unded on them , the migrants &apos; openings symbol@@ ises the limit ! &apos; and cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian bran@@ ching police .
some turned out of protest foods and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would go back from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral harm .
in the coming days we must hold talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not arrange a joint immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who returned to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was made that the EU states would like to capture more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis .
however , Hungary continued his hopes for an early action from Brussels , or his neighbors .
on Tuesday , the emergency number in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to permit the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Secretary of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates at the race , to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the past months , Hungary became an important bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are , looking for better life , and non @-@ war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws formed at midnight in Hungary into force , crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) to reach the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison pen@@ alties for the traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that emerged through the migration of migration , the Hungarian Government declares that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must not even agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but reporter by Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people are trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country .
they come up by having damaged the fence , they are now in custody to police , and are accused of bur@@ ying crimes according to the new law .
authorities are to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border areas with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after having arrived a train w@@ agon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos gave up the main division of Gren@@ zen@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of men and put a crowd in order to push there .
about 20 succeeded . but thousands of them remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into a national pol@@ l
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead a double @-@ seat advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the Presi@@ dential elections ( 58 per cent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who had not announced yet , receives backing from 15 percent of the presidential elec@@ torate for the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the presidential election , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is established which candidates are to support them .
but Clin@@ ics Supp@@ orters are employed in their selection as the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and ham@@ pers , but these origins have dimin@@ ished .
her support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only returning here with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has contrac@@ ted itself , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a major advantage in the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit advantage in the Liber@@ al , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
approximately half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say that they would support with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some and yet another 15 percent would only support them as they are the can@@ di@@ ate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thrilled especially by their enthusiasm .
the views are stronger with those that currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters are going to say that they Clinton support enthusiasm with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t &apos;s Supp@@ orters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the correct answer , is the most common answer that it is time that a woman president is served ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best can@@ di@@ ate candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters also men@@ tions their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the use of problems and voters are also cited .
as the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ ans , 57 percent of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be a second choice for the party , bi@@ den is on top .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be a second option far ahead of S@@ anders .
decides not decides to can@@ dic@@ ate the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with biking in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
in the five @-@ five percent of democratic voters , Clinton , as a can@@ di@@ ate candidate , saw the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure decreased from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
however , in the question , what is more important in one candidate , Democratic voters call for questions of voters .
similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for that voters hold the presidential election .
in some important features , the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in the election of their party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
more tru@@ ths Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den fights with the three candidates best when Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about His ( 15 percent ) , but 27 per cent have no opinion about him .
democratic voters of the presidential election also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all this measurements about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server while the Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to be asked , most of the Democratic voters of the Presi@@ dential elections are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinion has not been influenced overall .
but there is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the light came to light , split .
most of the Americans said that the E @-@ mail Contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated .
it &apos;s mainly republi@@ can , more than six of ten , who say their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton considered genu@@ in@@ ely regarded the voters of their party as genuine and trusted rule , this will continue to be a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 per cent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the elec@@ torate does not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the country &apos;s voting rights does not consider den@@ ying as non @-@ honest and non @-@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump still receive good notes with guidance .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority looks more rather than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters behind the election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the elec@@ tors in their new pol@@ l and some of them fall dramatically to the candidates .
Republican voters continue to support a b@@ ump in large numbers . the support grew from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , up 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes a b@@ ump under republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ herself , is beaten with Wiscon@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest point , and from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the sample mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which has been published last week shows that Car@@ son advances into the p@@ olls - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed im@@ ump much ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view over the last week , Car@@ son found tr@@ ump some side hi@@ kes for the former neuro@@ surgeon , after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the umps on question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaig@@ ning in I@@ owa .
pleasant beach temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is still warm to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , only a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough to find warm water .
a bathroom in the north or the Baltic is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
man@@ cher goes no more into the sea . maximum 18 degrees is the water in the north and Baltic sea this week , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean sea : in the East even it comes to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood is bur@@ dened by the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student taking a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an compl@@ ain against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Muslim attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an execution ritual as in September 2013 brutal and delayed his transportation into the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police par@@ ted .
officials said he was charged with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly refused to go on a frozen field at a frozen field .
and Mr. den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and warned about an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms to Goo@@ ds and Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to en@@ vis@@ age the Council , police officer Chris Wagner said in a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and exhibited the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle , by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries .
however , after a self @-@ op@@ ilot report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added with bl@@ unt injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the ik@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year at the Sil@@ ks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder and third parties for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with genocide and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take part in the concerned people , but if there is an organization , which - officially or un@@ official - this is sanc@@ tioned right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College had forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has refu@@ te its affili@@ ation to the city group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase of interest is coming , and the squ@@ ad gets caught in Wan@@ ken , to get back for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank so strongly emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on how to increase interest rates , but rather to the time period , which is needed to norm@@ alize the norm@@ alization .
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could notice that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to a Zin@@ ser@@ mon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on too low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no imp@@ lications .
here is a historic trend , based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases things for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase comes , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to rep@@ licate between 12 and 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study what had happened to interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the past six months after 500 days , with an average return in the past six months , from 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares of the shares occur later in the Lower cycle and returns to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest rate increases them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not even exist before and could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 has only been twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter after the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases in a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all high @-@ performance cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing vibration reduction in GDP and soon after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; according to the report .
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far the longest , whom the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months and these have so far been 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ atile , since the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar , like on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
after bonds , the ren@@ ces seem to change the direction as soon as the first raise / drop in the cycle happens .
at the end of the increasing cycle , the bond yield immediately dropped , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the rise in the interest rates result will bring you closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a dis@@ counting of the curve .
high interest rates often bring better yields in such an climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analyst at Schw@@ ab , said in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones believe that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prosp@@ ect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest have increased , the profit@@ ability is fl@@ atter , lending relaxation and the vol@@ atility increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and complete , businesses that wrap the larger part of their business activities in the United States , benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ational corporations with high debt will be worse since a growing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial interest rate increases extremely positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet results in every interest rate after each of the interest rate hike in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ces and low vol@@ atility at their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure shar@@ ehol@@ ding , consumers are also benef@@ iting from increasing costs .
Sav@@ er might see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are as quickly that will occur .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament &apos;s man@@ oeu@@ vre critici@@ zed the stations because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argued that he is not to distinguish themselves from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards and said they only used The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; parliamentary colleague ladies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice On The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliament &apos;s committee and increases new pressure on the transmitter , prove that he does not do something that does not do the private . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , said that the public @-@ legal radio station is still being dis@@ car@@ ing &quot; and increasingly no longer differ from his commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I &apos;m not using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems like to turn Classic FM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also quoted at BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name , The Br@@ its .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples , where you are actually only im@@ i@@ ating what is already on the market , Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director showed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to the public through live music and information on the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , to inv@@ ent new music and to give new works to work , I really consider to be important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it should be done to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British agre@@ es with classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production which , during the hearing in the committee on culture , media , and sport , fell under fire to step down the commercial ri@@ vals on his feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins handle The Voice - the musical talent Show in the BBC , which was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was the judge - &quot; made in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the company &quot; a hit from our company &apos;s own stable &quot; when it star@@ es the next time a entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or spending money of the fee formats for other entertainment formats .
Internet revenue rose in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday might be responsible .
in the first three months of 2015 , seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that Black Friday lost the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping center has been transformed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into s@@ cour@@ ge cities .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales were stagn@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales are stagn@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and then go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as a buyer began to make purchases of their cell@@ phones .
it meant more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we possibly will see that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black Friday phenomenon from America was imported from America , is cited as a reason for its listing sales .
experts believe that buyers will return to this event , which will take place on Friday last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites stor@@ med .
experts believe that Black Friday will combat the buyer with the purch@@ aser , who could stop buyers while doing shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium have found out that £ 5 per spend a little over 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third purchases are now being conducted via web shops .
at the same time , buying more than one quarter of the people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of the track chains in the inner city cities .
Muslims buried the ap@@ osi@@ ties in Mecca for the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 victims are attributed to Muslims in the first par@@ av@@ ours in Mecca throughout the streets .
Saudi Arabia det@@ ects the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group to the collapse
the Department of Health reported that 3@@ 94 people were killed , after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were driven by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed in Mecca the large mosque .
trau@@ matic filled , largely in white dressed , the circuit to search its respect , when the first of the dead got their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isle cemetery .
the c@@ ession session moved on the Holy Place where only days had a crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the bed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the family Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which left the last 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 farms , which were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Zone in Mecca , were carried by streets .
among the dead , Q@@ assi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane collapsed when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual ship in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that the p@@ addle for Mecca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group would not have to refra@@ in from the patient &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency in English @-@ speaking information reports did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad must be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was killing what caused the fall of the sick , which fell into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch took place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not give testimony about the Coll@@ ap@@ se and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also counts the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mek@@ kas to Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project which is managed by the Bin Laden Group .
since decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the ruler of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger projects .
the late @-@ day leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a farewell son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane reaches a strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of each healthy person .
officials said 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; government officials agree that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the relatives of the killed , and the same sum also permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injured people get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople are past
Brit@@ ons deal increasingly ar@@ tis@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified worker from Eastern Europe has rise behind
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are targets on ar@@ tis@@ ans , are opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q will join forces nationwide
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its are their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen , who perform the work in their home ,
if you sk@@ ill@@ fully deal with a hammer or brush with a brush in walls , these days apparently belong to a minority .
for Britain is becoming increasingly working tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who possesses the tre@@ ach@@ erous chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to underground prices has now been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
hence , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other screens , who are working on a builder and include 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men were silent .
she said it was necessary to establish itself the growing demo@@ graphic trends that are more female Single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move it more strongly to a balance .
generally , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of all decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 , listed among the Top Teams to reflect a same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies just 50 percent of the team , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - Di@@ versity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group owed the cost of closing of the shops .
because of this trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function of a@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt District Court on Wednesday , Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball player a@@ I / DO@@ B must have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and consent .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with official abuse .
he was acquitted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the prosecutor &apos;s prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , it was cryst@@ all@@ ised that the accused in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 of the money of the United States , concerning whom they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
he counts the damage with around 400,000 euros .
the sport@@ s@@ men are also charged with money pass .
this Fak@@ tum was divided into the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it must be negotiated at a later date .
at a time when in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity appe@@ aled the defence that there was not a reference to the association at any time .
the sport@@ scar had only been mis@@ counted and the sports club , for which it had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and invested in that they invested much time and money , from the debt - the liabilities were approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us go further up to the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the daily bread department of the financial system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have given money to give our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the dispute .
have been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts .
moreover , by appropriate financial success , the payout of allow@@ ances declined retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the post@@ p@@ ance damages only years later , namely as from the year 2003 , when an increase was paid on the account .
therefore the l@@ ump and non @-@ detailed studies seemed to be explained , the former homeless , explained the processes .
the accounts and spar@@ ks gover@@ ned the two accused together , saying the other accused .
why the withdrawal for the association did not have been addressed in detail , the judge asked .
the organisation has not been interested in detail for financial interests , it is important that the debt relief has been , so the answer .
when in 2011 against the investigation , a functional investigation began due to official abuse , an amount of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
they were all back , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran on the names of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards , the respon@@ dent man knew not an answer .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor dropped in his room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants would have been inform@@ ing informed , the function took place .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as a &quot; compensation . &quot;
why are compensation for damage ? , judges and public prosecutor wanted to know .
there@@ on , the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never materi@@ alised .
but what shall I do if the lawyer tells , &quot; You are all of you out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a law ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the paper said that he has never taken a cent salary , he only has o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at Di@@ ets he was charged € 1,000 a month in di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
these may be judged correctly , according to an operating check , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer been kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter had also included the second accused .
all containers are exchanged in cash , with which he had to drive from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ burg , in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard service adds more 30.000 jobs
in addition to the three @-@ year job loss , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese become further jobs in the development of the company further jobs .
there is no end to the monitor hou@@ set@@ ters from Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US @-@ based technology Group plans to reduce the mining of 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate clients .
as a result , the company will be saved at EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) , the company distributed on Tuesday .

death shake at Delta State University left no justi@@ fication
after ar@@ cher@@ y and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted to make it uns@@ ure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , teacher for Ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , announced the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , Some@@ one shot , and someone was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plan@@ ner said to the staff of the emergency department , that the police must send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but he could not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but he probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry that I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing this note , Count 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , one professor for history , killing him before he eventually took his life on Monday night when police officer him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he caught nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship also with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there should be no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three inter@@ relationship . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was described by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years married as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s from Sun Herald .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called relatives to a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police captured him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled to the woods , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a PhD degree in spring 2015 by the University of Delta State University .

the Euro@@ wings premium line should be as independently as possible .
managing director Carsten B@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future .
the Nine has under@@ scored the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly due to double fra@@ c@@ ture
in the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester , Luke Shaw held a double fra@@ grant of his right bone during the Champions League .
while the left wing ends to the left , and closing it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a der@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Shaw was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field of playing and needed oxygen before he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ c@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United who &apos;s very hard and then fantastic playing , and then it happens .
he had a oxygen mask in the dressing @-@ cabin .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ ming , it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and a suspension of a penalty .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not condemn the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe as kap@@ ut I am , my path to recovery starts now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
herein : Manchester United has the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at the PS@@ V
the United Kingdom Def@@ enders has an additional inc@@ entive in France to recover from June to next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very gri@@ m hurt . &quot;
when a player leaves the square at this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico has played against Van Ga@@ als in the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt opponents , and if you are hearing it &apos;s a very bad violation , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like if he had touched &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also transported to the hospital - following a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely , David Cameron doesn &apos;t know the bay ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost extravag@@ ant .
unless you are , you may be David Cameron .
being asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favorite child@@ r@@ ens book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to die in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it seems to have missed an image or a message which we missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph describes the story of the book , instead of adding a summary of the 2012 film version , adding the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ua @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , who had to see his desire to see a real tree , &quot; read it . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage had been , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that still hadn &apos;t been susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron featured just like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films to be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , which is all artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams .
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron sees the story of the book so little familiar , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees for@@ getting , Th@@ an stri@@ ped Once @-@ ler despite the protest of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snor@@ ing that &quot; that says in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR challenge was deleg@@ ated to one hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times after a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson suggests that the text had probably come from the Cam@@ er@@ ons Elec@@ toral Plan .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the German team from England but it is still hard .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the ca@@ des that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series does not stand on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing Dis@@ order , and the shared spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a young positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th dropped out of the England test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th to be hard for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , is of course difficult to analyse .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ te@@ amm@@ ate are aimed at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ee , because - and I said that - players are their own best choice .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
when he hopefully beat other purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he had not achieved so good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives , to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to get home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation , which one can rise , was that England first put down Jonathan in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales are coming in , and he is a striking man which I highly acc@@ u@@ sts .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must pay at least the same chances as those prior to him , but this depends on the team &apos;s order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook , bringing a Extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , appeared on , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a striking man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has shown already that he is a devil player of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps does not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no major difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he re@@ signed as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred inst@@ ances immediately and did not look back .
afar Abdul@@ ari is coming in the ca@@ des as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the b@@ acc@@ user and 35 with the ball - and think that it is a P@@ unt , but there &apos;s no huge numbers of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who rise their hands and the trainer have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team , England has made some smart ad@@ ditions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup .
he is one of the most delicate guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful commitment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket @-@ Competition as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the changing cabin , even if the messages stand in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ate &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ work do not define the schedule .
and you have to remember that , as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain from the EU ) could win on cash if the economy starts into a flat set by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ issued re @-@ negoti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of the Labour Party or the TU@@ C who suffered violent because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ bu@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend explains that some member states , as deeply ro@@ sp@@ ed into different crises such as the EU it is now and not always out of own fault , Britain itself created agenda with spl@@ itting conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contrac@@ tual changes , which they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like this , although they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call him Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who desires a great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Leave me alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and letting go through that more and more short @-@ sight@@ less ministers and officials present in some capit@@ als of the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we will stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is cau@@ tious but she has been on power and wants to leave the office for 10 years before it looks po@@ or@@ ly for her , as is done in the exagger@@ ated way such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or its replacement by 2017 .
it is also a for@@ b@@ ating force .
Poland may possibly have a nation@@ alistic righ@@ tist government , Spain , one left .
it is hard to imagine that they will become a leg that will help themselves to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better made to prevent the UK exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most other separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may also not plan more helpful remarks , especially in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s train@@ ee campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , guess it is my friend .
&quot; the new trial was a ple@@ a , &quot; and &quot; Britain has nothing worth of ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ on , however , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who assisted our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may remember being weak on Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opport@@ un@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name , who has made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all his dist@@ ast@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ car@@ ing sha@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners and the p@@ seudo non @-@ intu@@ ple who possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar to her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , they are better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he was opposed to himself as a cam@@ er@@ man refer@@ end@@ le , because Bl@@ air had put the principle on the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps at the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to dev@@ ote to me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch fired 80 @-@ s years to repeat a mistake then and today .
it may take time but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll just print it out - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ u@@ rea @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild@@ est battle of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ on can be said Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week , said when the boy sc@@ outs in him , didn &apos;t admit that Cor@@ b@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
he remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s and his old father worked in television to his Labour cabinet @-@ mate to his Labour Commissioner without going too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
but to fight at &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said that what J@@ C told its fellow collectors and M@@ EPs from all reports on Monday night .
whatever the curved bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ bit@@ n is always trying - remember that he even has touched me - News Search remains in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of the social media , a breeding plant of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no open card to Europe , which allowed him to keep his Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ al campaign for a self @-@ comprehen@@ sion like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is thinking about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ ners are fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ sions to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite har@@ p @-@ economy , the anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of an es@@ ot@@ eric debate on left dis@@ sidents for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of a small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ity on Nato - Tom Watson , it is convinced that J@@ C will not allow a campaign to the outlet - will be obliged to try foreign diplom@@ ats to find in everything a sense for their superior at home .
why should Paris or Berlin ab@@ stain political capital - they also have mis@@ erable elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this could be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the U.S. have already been disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was remin@@ ded of a little reminis@@ cent of the start on Monday , which was named British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking was made of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , the researchers said .
experts that write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the power rating of the data and sent out to connections between some experts and tobacco industries .
an article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month touched the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily short basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write to BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims to build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the general claim that the claim is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions about the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting of a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health was , whose Managing Director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .

the research work of the group &quot; stands marked &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; wrote , wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; were prohibited .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director for health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that it had already been re@@ acted on the claims of BM@@ J .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot;
every second lifetime smoking dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are small in comparison , but that we still have long @-@ term effects to study .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to the public information about what the evidence occupies , and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die yearly in an illness with reference to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system $ 2 billion a year .
through the clear resolutions of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our independent authority .
BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders , former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fees should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent via other UK @-@ channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to publicly critici@@ ze the fact that they are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , highly controversial window of time against the most popular shows of their rival and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson that he tried to come in contact with the BBC in his time for six years in his time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or sends you to clearly not sub@@ sidy ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations@@ Committee under his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the circuit fee , which I do not think medium or long @-@ term , it should be at least for programs that do not make any other or commissioned .
they will send The Voice In a first @-@ class time@@ frame , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is natural nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a ruling tax programs financed , that could also be financed without a subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both its own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I stri@@ ve to see how this public @-@ legal TV should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is due to the hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will again give up what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal agen@@ ic programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where they cannot measure the audience , but they can orient@@ ate when they go on their seem@@ ingly holy missions for a justi@@ fication of $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody wanted to see them ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the radio fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ ress@@ ful system in terms of conditions , who can receive the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ , if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former sky@@ - and Channel 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David El@@ stein &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which also announced in front of the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should review their zip mission to educ@@ ate , form and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said only little by the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . and it should be an example to change , elabor@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels , Alli@@ ances go online to make everything online .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cell through sound waves
the video shows how to change the nem@@ ato@@ des direction in the moment they are pun@@ ish with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically @-@ changed nervous systems which can be controlled by ro@@ aring of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses , which are radi@@ ated for the human hearing , to be heard .
impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ ound .
next to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California said the Guardian , that the procedure for one day could replace the depths of brain stimul@@ ation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of human symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ ul@@ mer normally did not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound shafts , then penet@@ rate the worms .
the increased ultras@@ ound safety impacts on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic cells and found in membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves carry the opening of these ion@@ ization channels and enable the cells that they are associated , such as Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen will carry out TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
if it turns ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro bubbles and transferred to worms , where they change the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic tics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows researchers to change neur@@ ons with stimul@@ ation of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound technique can be hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily hal@@ ve the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still remember the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ sion@@ ed smile of those who have off@@ ended me - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the residence halls / residence halls ranges from slightly oppos@@ ing up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell you where you come , if you stand in terms of Cor@@ bit@@ n and why you don &apos;t love Y@@ m@@ ite neither love , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find people who like to find out in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were burned in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages recipes , film @-@ night event venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attached to their under@@ wear .
referring to : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um @-@ culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life long friendship .
that can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing can tell you about culture : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship , but you must go away , so that I get the energy back , which I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a pe@@ dic@@ one is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send SMS to him instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos hur@@ t@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with baking .
since you begin the Uni at the cli@@ max of the back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking to the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange when the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile , if I have a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain , enter@@ tain , and will perhaps associate your face with a tasty surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad missing cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make sure people sleep sleeping , if you drop anchor .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
naturally , the cla@@ ws of hen &apos;s chicken , but is it a drop of milk in your tea too ?
check with the owner of the milk .
chances are , they say that they themselves want to operate even if they cook inside the inside .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my fellow @-@ ro@@ omm@@ ates that added to her milk an washing machine to pun@@ ish di@@ vines .
she is now in prison .
you should not do any noise , keeping people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in gl@@ ass@@ aus .
a girl on my door@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something out , Drum &amp; bass had a little qui@@ eter around , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they acted out loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbors two hours , before they left their own music , shut their door and went to their three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be a found@@ ly embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses to move to them and then see them every day and see how they move all together common friends ?
of course , the heart is its own ways - but if a hot co @-@ hab@@ it is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
at the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its not open room , the border is between a gr@@ ind and mo@@ b@@ bing , as it seems .
a good soldier is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but you will never reconc@@ ile someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
do not close their door , and place your keys into a glass of water which will put you in the freezer - but do not tor@@ ch their poss@@ essions in the ceiling not more than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , All@@ ent@@ ails , Ger@@ lingen @-@ earned
the real estate agency Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is built in the Medi@@ terran@@ e Bas@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need room for refugees , but also the only attractive mother and a well @-@ earned mother . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old at the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees rush to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner imag@@ ines how quickly a cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees thro@@ ws on the homes market .
what solutions do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the massive accommodation in containers of containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugee stream , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a whole ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a very f@@ ew@@ ter needs space .
it makes easier integration .
this is different if people sub@@ s in blocks of homes .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then , the houses can be changed easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without a plot .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
do the requirements have contrac@@ ted out their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I successfully passed the project right away .
the only complicated Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert makes it very complicated and the parking space order system .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still sub@@ divided , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three places .
only in the cities there is room .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but are you not tigh@@ tened the competi@@ tor to pay affordable flats ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : indeed , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years but were built in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , including ordinary people , living room .
not only refugees , but as well as the only attractive mother or the low @-@ earned mother .
I show how one can still build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

some have encountered problems following the installation , since they get an error message , telling that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users will be recommended to either wait until the rush will go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ bable by adding the updates . likewise , it will be easier to er@@ ase it when you set up a special tool , and then re@@ install them , once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the up@@ dating or is near a charging device , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple fails to assume that the update is continued , as the phone may turn away on half @-@ way and could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of updates .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ center Anton@@ isti@@ cians have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social Foundation and opened a new open place at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
besides consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social Foundation attracts up from the mountain into downtown .
more exactly at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ leben was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , from now senior citizens and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as care insurance , or to care services of the nur@@ ses and care products .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service , that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone .
there are countless many questions .

the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ leben also offers prevention , health care and wellness in addition to the consultations .
Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or a physical therapy treatment .

&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new Qu@@ arti@@ ce office in the city center is seen in demo@@ graphic change .
because this creates a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) also dedic@@ ates himself to the inauguration ceremony at the age of the inauguration . there are numerous events and offers on the program , and these shop invite one of regular sponsored support . &quot;

when you no longer saw the car , the injured off the building was smoking to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male child .
under the cap of a hit @-@ hole , one gets on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured ex@@ hal@@ ation needed to be hosp@@ itali@@ zed in a hospital .
up to date , only one age of perpet@@ rators occurs .

Dr. Frank Müller continues to take on practice Fel@@ low and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ a and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Z@@ hang@@ ausen .
furthermore , also for example , Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the land there are doctors - As@@ endorf are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller continues to work out the practice Fel@@ gen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still present his successor in the next few months with half a half point to the page .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then it inv@@ ests 3,@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance , when the maid met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ at@@ oll , who currently complet@@ es their specialized veter@@ inary education at the Hospital hospital and will also invite to enter into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller should fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was ready , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller was pleased with the idea of running his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .
and so one was settled , the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
it continues to be resident in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the second @-@ time father , Frank Müller also grew up there , with his media instance in Hannover , followed by stations in several surg@@ eries , as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel .
he is currently active as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was ordered to conducting an executive doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lows worked as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as in@@ denti@@ sts .
&quot; the final copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller .
after the refurb@@ ishment , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examination as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EK@@ GS together and need more consultations .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of 50000 euros will get the m@@ iller in the context of a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses Sam@@ ir par@@ ody by Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 2,000 patients come to the practice of Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ at@@ oll every quarter in the practice Fel@@ low@@ ausen , in the northeast of Germany around 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home rule .
Frank Müller : a positive side effect through Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel rock breaks in As@@ endorf .
if not a successor had been found , she would have gone .
he who visits the talk hour , he is still looking confi@@ dently in confi@@ dential faces : taking over seven medical specialists and the cleaning charge of the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell end in the village of As@@ endorf , the medical practice was practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen sm@@ iles were re@@ members .
a little melanch@@ ol@@ y understand it after the long time .
&quot; but we are going to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and are often seen many patients often , &quot; says the Inter@@ n@@ tin .
their husband are compl@@ aining : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pressed myself against gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are driven off at our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to that .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants an application for asylum can , of course , be &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
the supply and security of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia den@@ ies &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously been informed that Slovenia would continue to leave for refugees in direction of Austria and Germany and restore cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
but this did not see the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; in Slovenia rather I will intensi@@ fy the supervision of the fron@@ tier , especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already strongly checked in the outer space of the Schengen area .
as the minister empha@@ sized , Sloven@@ ians will have its limitations for refugees , but not abri@@ olet .
&quot; every EU member must fill his comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system could not work , &quot; says Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ an .
as the Croatian Government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to pass through the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d at the border crossing on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to retreat .
the Croatian police was able to attack them in the neighbouring corn fields .
since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , a police station with new refugees meet in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
mostly Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are even in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have agreed to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , followed by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government denied it , however , that it was to defeat people certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; says it .
according to the media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived at the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the morning , during the day a further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the occup@@ ants were on the road the whole night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia around 500 kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this is how it might actually be even predicted by ob@@ serving the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
in Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic earlier st@@ resses that his country for the event of a powerful influ@@ x of refugees have been prepared for possible exceptional circumstances .
he did not give details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member gives a comprehensive possibilities to the border control . &quot;
you lead strict controls through to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has since passed through a good report , as far as the standard of the border controls .
on a Serbian side , there are still around 300 refugees detained at the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to go further to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried on Wednesday early at a local ey@@ es@@ eye in Hor@@ gos still : he keep the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not take itself for very high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could not be said , whether they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
aid to migrants - hazardous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute country maps that altern@@ ate alternative routes across Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still no more spacious mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine @-@ gath@@ ers was sent to the border region .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ est assistance was attracted to its 20th anniversary with this action and confron@@ ts itself entirely with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life , therefore we have gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical host support is provided by the pass@@ ers as well as for questions and talks as volunteer workers .
while some pass a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k and to read the sentence , &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can continue &quot; the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; remain ongoing , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m still not &quot; and go on .

therefore , this public effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds would be good .
that not everyone should go out on the tables , however , that it was understand@@ able , ultimately , it was a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death can be hair@@ y according to Tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ est showed a lot in recent years that people will open .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ result for@@ ged , financial outlook for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the final quarter , and the supply location was limited to a full year owing to the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approx . 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this point in last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share ran over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. predicted a $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in financial year , ending 20 cent less than at the previous forecast .
analysts were expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prosp@@ ect comes from premium price increases which amount to 4.9 percent , and will be effective on 4 January and , despite a higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ goods transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it still expected that the result will rise above the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and account for growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company will bring solid earnings when you we@@ aken the we@@ aker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later as the rival UPS , plans to set 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex has ended 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research said analysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of them were expecting analysts at 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has shown a decline in the past few years for an international priority sign that disp@@ at@@ ched up sales in his unit Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales advanced to 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat with higher costs for greater par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result because of higher labour costs , fell into the cargo sector .
at the Pre@@ market Trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares amounted to 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , it included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spent two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z for the first time since almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey Se@@ als is located in the United States .
the card is a reminder of the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues to the economic interests of the Nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission statement : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices keep stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ riv@@ alled third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be spo@@ iled by an un@@ parall@@ eled inc@@ entive by the close to zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the figures show that they grow solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might make this vol@@ atility by the lifting of interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they are ob@@ serving , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ers and Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty on the global market enough to maintain , continues to wait , &quot; said she .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , what keeps the financial market uns@@ ure .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
but the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows just a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the equity market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition it is because the strateg@@ ists are decre@@ asing the impact by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so they won &apos;t fall in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate hike would calm down the financial markets , because it is the uncertainty when the F@@ ed should act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that it would be required this year despite the complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , enh@@ ancing the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and in the proximity of the levels which the F@@ ed sees as full work .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation went constantly under the central bank of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can tackle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension in the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world woke up the end of last month after China had upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Group fell by more than 16 % below its peak when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , what the Dow is now about 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives , market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation when you should increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the messages have not occurred over the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former staff of the US @-@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is lots of uncertainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable sources that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the principal subjects of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere poin@@ ter of the former head , Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could restri@@ ct its monetary expansion &quot; to tight , &quot; dis@@ b@@ anded cue points around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in other areas , but also discuss other central banks and experts , to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell as head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has had a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently is not associated with the economic Fund@@ ament@@ ally data . &quot;
L@@ acker , right @-@ owned member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed itself as an example for interest @-@ raising decisions in 1998 @-@ 1999 , as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its head in three sessions in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ iting effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability within a serious crisis such as the 2008 market launch , Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the committee on interest in the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence come not close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation , in which she was afraid of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of the time .

Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ at@@ rics Company Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women on this way , how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all nutrients that they need to establish a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment , the mothers should be conducted .
a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet would actually lead the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the con@@ greg@@ ational Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ desired gy@@ ne@@ pl@@ ets at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are step by step forward : in recent municipal conditions , the revised building application has been cut @-@ by without large discussions .
previously , the panel , among other things , had decided to requ@@ esting an application for a statutory public &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; by the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form in the roof structure .
the saddle is intended to be a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ tious first and roof@@ top . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully big South &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger said in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , about the roof that is written for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is therefore significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof , no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der family rule is rather restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with gy@@ ms , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; such as St@@ eigen@@ berger .
gy@@ ne@@ tic@@ ulture on the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
in the cost of costs , around 2.3 million euros is calculated .
grants are expected from school and latitude support .
the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the land@@ lord &apos;s office of testing for the 18 x 36 meters .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of the employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the mira@@ cul@@ ous plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kre@@ ises , in front of which Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board , will take a decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans should be converted , all of the nearly 50 staff will continue to be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved to fishermen and the existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the staff , which cannot be offered with g@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice near the hospital .
on the question of who should follow the lead , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came in the game , who was willing to take over from October 1 , and changing his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and an extension of the offer within the scope of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fis@@ her@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Ro@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the center for gastro@@ enter@@ ological illnesses .
the next two years to become a fisher@@ man with his team , if the member of the Supervisory Board is to be raised to both houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ic@@ ity , which still has 35 beds , will eventually be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
previously , the County has planned this for 2018 , when the current restructuring was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , re@@ signs to contrary to what the house that is owned by the federal government , in the future as a shelter for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as the real estate continues , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say there are several consider@@ ations .
there is currently a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ sa@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry , as well .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer on the Le@@ ch &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; by his employees .
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked as a director for more than 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked to have been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take up the position of the medical director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened more and again from closure , departments became closed , for example , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
today the hand@@ bags of the Rhine @-@ Neckar Lion is at the Berg@@ ische HC this evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) tonight .
the league leader in the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , but there is no reason for the su@@ bl@@ ance .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener at B@@ HC have a painful defeat and there have some rub@@ b@@ ish in there .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of H@@ ousing
the situation on the German residential property market is ten@@ se .
over and more refugees seek a paid lead .
the pressure on the residential property market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaign on the German residential property market have long begun .
more people are pushing ahead with the refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income @-@ income citizens in order to have the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing structure &quot; comes to this result .
for comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
therefore 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter .
many hit the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the apartment rentals .
according to statistics from the Federal Office , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
the negative development of the apartment market is , however , not only to the rising refugee numbers .
the study also represents significant cuts in residential construction policies of recent years .
Germany sho@@ ots a residential deficit in front of itself , which becomes bigger from year to year .
currently , in the metrop@@ olitan areas there are already approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many people , living in large cities , were living in flat share rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel M@@ um &quot; due to the floo@@ ding on the residential market .
in the major cities , the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing structure &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives are to boost the social housing market again .
so the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for funded apartments may be suspended .
according to the alliance , there are attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options .
the sponsor@@ ship programme for Refu@@ gee Agency of Kf@@ W has already been well @-@ employed in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was Monday evening , with 184 million euros more than half of the available amounted to some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are forming a corridor
there is practically no coming to Hungary in fact , more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the journey through Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia &apos;s neighbour through the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slov@@ ene household , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the German TV RTL has reported .
on the eve of Hungary , Hungary had sealed its borders for refugees .
new laws which came into force on the same day , do virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we are preparing this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
people , however , are people who wanted not to live in Croatia .
Croatian police arrested the first fu@@ gi@@ tives at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia .
most of these media reports reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were both with the bus and a taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not encounter a border f@@ ences .
for this , the border breaks down other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mining metho@@ des now should quickly create a secure passage .
after the closure of the border , after the closure of the border , there are hardly more refugees .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 han@@ dic@@ ated people .
shortly before the opening of the Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws put the over@@ coming and damage to the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
in this case , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the South Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the sentenced from death ranged up to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers have made a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the main passage of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees standing there .
however , there is no longer a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ sat one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered .
workers began to cut off workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage , which had left the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
lat@@ tice were disman@@ tled , and one of the lifts are rebuilt at the boundary .
no one wanted to express itself to the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still faced in the country , however .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was hal@@ ted on the German authorities in the morning .
regularly groups of refugees met regularly in Freil@@ assing .
Mayor stepped through the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge @-@ festival on Sunday with the hot@@ test , and suddenly there were ten people with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au with the train .
because Germany surprisingly only had the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; as Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we had the un@@ wanted score , then , with a snack and drink .
as we have said , we bring them to Pass@@ au with a car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not take him to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this was very happy with us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the train passes were on Sunday night in W@@ els by a ICE in a regional train heading towards Pass@@ au , to try it after the short @-@ term announcement that the train traffic to Germany was discontinued but still on the border .
however , before the boundary , the regional train was shut off at Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before , a twin @-@ brood @-@ race - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends for further Z@@ ig@@ en@@ nia , a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy politics :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help the construction of structures that ensure human , our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has officially opened the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the Dun@@ ge District of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering of these politics are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refu@@ gee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which invited them and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a major challenge in view of the continued refugee flow and the approaching winter , which make up decent conditions for protection of protection .
and there will be another greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 35,000 shopping districts
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee space .
Christian Konrad is always familiar with his word .
the government has used to set up the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to exp@@ ose qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ record center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen have already received a grip on .
&quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turbul@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ stick situation . &quot;
altogether , Konrad is reck@@ oned with an average of 8@@ 5,000 quotes in the year .
in order to fulfill the number , 35,000 pensions have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led to talks with the government officials .
they would have safegu@@ ar@@ ded him , even for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it &apos;s going well , &quot; says Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar does not support Konrad .
tomorrow we will give a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born , making it clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations put the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator to the ORF promotion &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer simple accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels , who are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ ler@@ ors must have a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the lift .
for a temporary time , &quot; Emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior at the accommodation , Conrad is with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , which one doesn &apos;t even say un@@ truth in his face .
persu@@ asion is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
our own family @-@ search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of urban sp@@ urs and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design centers for the accommodation of refugees are planning the city of Linz .
this is at the moment not necessary because the affected parties can present themselves without such measures , says May@@ ors Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
further locations will be insp@@ ected for emergency , but further locations should be tested .
cri@@ tique of the city boss in the division of the refugees within the federal state .
also other districts have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not blocked &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ wick@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in refugee issues on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not blocked .
further continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
but there is now the appropriate border controls .
there will be no more refugees with refugees to Germany in advance .
however , the seek@@ ers would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once demanded more enhanced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria will res@@ ume the controls again to its borders is a logical consequence &quot; out of the existence of the German .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the complete refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and building facilities the stock market IT @-@ group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies of the New shi@@ pyard and , later , to acquire them .
from the beginning , S &amp; T collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
an investment of EUR 1.7 million were invested in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ centres .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter remains in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent increase it .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ su@@ er opened a second shop in the Arctic
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are central in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to put a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year old female owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ben@@ markt magazine : in the end , it has now been an increase in the form of another business location .
Fur@@ la @-@ Shop is found in Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , in which it sells bags , bags , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , now all revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
the first several weeks had been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long wondered if I am going to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , are inspired by the idea of a self @-@ site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only designers in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that have Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ concern has been filled with her mother in cra@@ dle .
I am conscious of the most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the specialized woman with their last safety .
maybe it &apos;s about that a beautiful bag is utilized for every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer &apos;s ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose citizens called An@@ ders .
this flag also connects some people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he comments on foreign @-@ hos@@ tile , journalists Ruben or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential campaign will kick off the campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
that will also be registered in the K@@ all@@ an@@ ese K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ ard would come from .
many of New Yor@@ kers with the we@@ aker is a term in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants location is related to -@@ zig corners with it is related .
his grandfather came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ atine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del has turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers still think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these are somehow exciting , but they are not so impressed with their own urban class , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps , in which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump who is not known for prot@@ ru@@ th@@ iness , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to King of heart .
though there are respect for the performance of the family , but also den@@ sit@@ ell the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the k@@ all@@ ish city within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in German : the gi@@ ver , says she .
the pump comes from the village of the An@@ gli@@ der .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened in the US a restaurant for gold mines .
the foundation stone of the real estate company were first principles in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their wish to return to the homeland , the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was active at that time .
he did not attend Tr@@ ump because he was once home without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ a@@ eg@@ alese history and folk music , Roland Paul , declared the film star@@ tup .
tr@@ ump would be the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal out@@ mig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes prominent statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
the had repeatedly ab@@ le@@ ased about Mexican immigrants in the US and asked the construction of a border wall to d@@ eter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the p@@ added is not such a lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant Mesopotam@@ ia ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always a few thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
Pen@@ sions zi@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came to an attendance at a visit for the Church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they may find it better if he won &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
if those , who were at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ w Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without pre@@ sidents Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , interviewed for Tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 kin@@ ks , including interest in the USA .
the upper Bavarian village of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
the vice @-@ president of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Society , Ludwig Wu@@ er@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 inhabitants in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria , there are 20 &quot; mountain climbing routes . &quot;
the unique alpine society is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in neighbouring countries .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 people .
at least one @-@ fifth of its surface must be recognized as protective zone .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son writes to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no large shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Malcolm saw with the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the stock seemed to play any role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators during its five capit@@ als , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase across the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number left behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
in the last months , Today the gap to sunrise was closed .

so far in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators on 3@@ 14.000 in today .
this is the most interesting , what happens every morning .

the great news for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of series to the Raf@@ ary Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently we@@ wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the shore of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were asked whether Thomson could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and beat the block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 people .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators , enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour from The Chase Australia Group achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia will strongly agree that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that failed to over@@ wings the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
a mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might be un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly evident , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood , finally lan@@ det at the bach@@ elor &apos;s , has been covered in the greatest secret bal@@ ances .
and none of the three left @-@ left girl will certainly not give up if she is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we are with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows a day , before three are taken , you may have noticed an indication of who will be the vic@@ tor .
Sam Wood continues to sealed his lips by the Fin@@ ally on Thursday
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood the perfect man is , and called his sense to humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as the reason why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the last Rose ? &quot; could their answers be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki made both of them fast - besides itself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a great relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Samuel &apos;s energies , I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is at his feet on Earth , making it so much fun with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay stated that the visit of the house was clear last week , that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and her family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m so worried about it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries according to his impressive open @-@ day training Day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost an angel so lost as it did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League conver@@ ts on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt Return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to appear his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies at the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press brief@@ ing after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched in a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings .
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian sales hopes for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field , and he later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not present a wor@@ sen@@ ing start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happened now , and only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the cuts with its Origin debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .

free voters want to challenge the 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee movement .
party and fac@@ tional President Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the FW @-@ autumn cl@@ ause in major wall@@ place in front of a heavy crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there are no such teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get contamination in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Free Sec@@ tions of Free voters declined by Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , different main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of Asyl@@ um will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not possible , we have to understand the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free Elec@@ tor boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want free voters to slide the Free voters as soon as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also asked more staff for the administration courts , which are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW body critic@@ ised that several German states are not consistently critici@@ zed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need the national standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is post@@ p@@ inn@@ ate , others not . &quot;

but this is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police ra@@ mmed in a crowd that demonstr@@ ating the proposed new constitution , one officer on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Sales Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters have assembled outside a police station , some of whom cast stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have used lac@@ ri@@ llas and shot down into the air before it re@@ handle upon rubber .
20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber plane model employed by which is known to be able to kill it , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously to produce such a high death rate .
the confron@@ tation was the last in weeks of non@@ violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ en@@ i say that new provinces are formed in the scope of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ esis , who want to own a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were violent cl@@ ashes since the age of 10 .
killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a controversial issue in Nepal which was gover@@ ned for centuries .
work on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the leg@@ islat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ islat@@ ure increased this week through certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

for months , behind closed doors have been negotiated , ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and dra@@ gged .
now there are plans for a new holiday estate on the small sea near Em@@ den at the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the city development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point was standing on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
in 1990 , under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf Behr@@ inger went out of the system &apos;s construction management board in the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council &apos;s members and more than 50 visitors .
but it was good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the debate has been carried out in the discussion around ten to 12 million euros .
fier@@ c@@ ely reactions among the owners of the owners , who were come to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
on the committee of interest in the semi @-@ advoc@@ acy of the semi @-@ tra@@ ilers , pro @-@ ieve , Roberto Schulz : &quot; this will be a giant sl@@ ot@@ z that out@@ performs all the others . &quot;
moreover , he fears like some other project critics , that the traffic would strongly increase by the intended size of the plant , &quot; that whole bus would have to come , so that says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well @-@ hectare estate of the former inn is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger .
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google will start collecting donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise the thousands of refugees benef@@ iting the thousands of refugees to flee the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ c@@ ements the donations of donations in his blog .
instead of leaving an manager who made the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee that was fled with their family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences .
&quot; for our journey there were many dark stations and buses , like hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; they wrote .
I was lucky .
but because the refugee and migrants are grown in Europe , many people are desper@@ ately searching for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / was to be doubled to $ 11 million .

for easy @-@ to @-@ weight diabe@@ tic , weight @-@ loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easy @-@ weigh@@ ted people with type 2 diabetes can last a new study of at least five years .
it &apos;s too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote an article for the new study in j@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight @-@ loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
for the years , obesity has proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in humans that have been overweight in ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng , General Hospital Data , who have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ go the operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments remained approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go surgical procedure dissolved , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely in@@ different and in part with 28 % .
the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group dissolved itself completely by only one percent in comparison with diabetes and in part , at only about two percent .
moreover , the results were subjected to the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
researchers also overs@@ aw the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the glucose levels throughout time .
in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is considered the best among the 7 percent .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this improved &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - not the mortality rate in five years , so the head of researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also understand the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and larger reactions in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) had a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not have a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ going rel@@ ob@@ ese people who underwent an O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s soo@@ thing for people interested with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this low BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should take their weight seriously when the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated the genetic changes that have joined their body with obesity and diabetes , the reverse is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not pick up all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to stop violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised to start the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he requested that , among these circumstances , interests of humanity are to be submitted before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of the West European countries sought to visit the refugee crisis , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to conquer the crisis , he empha@@ sized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to address the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and discovered that violent response to the USA went to a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush ; and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he translated violence and caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rise in four @-@ times increase of dis@@ infection products by children during the past 4 years
tox@@ in centers in the USA report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , the highly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants swal@@ low , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased to children under 12 , from 3@@ 266 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lopez CNN .
he said that some children should drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ agen@@ ic in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of cheap experience .
adolescents have reportedly mixed dis@@ infection with non @-@ alcoholic beverages to obtain harder drink .
younger children can become attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lopez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are rub@@ ber@@ ized .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes , and or@@ ang@@ es which are very attractive for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in infants , some sy@@ ring@@ es are able to lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ call centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and if children come to it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from following strawberry pul@@ s@@ ine dis@@ infection in the school was taken into an emergency treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered by an adult she said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor that she treated at the G@@ w@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked their words and was not able to leave when she arrived in the emergency review .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl fallen by alcohol and pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .

it would have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has recommended members and teachers recommended to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ est@@ ry using and hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , there were a number of disinf@@ ect@@ ants connected to death cases .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ infection , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product me@@ thanol contained a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active substance .
in January , three students from the fourth class in New York City were con@@ du@@ bbed their &quot; mal@@ icious &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ infection , and she named them out of their space .
the police visited the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and demonstrated vast measures to the school authority .

there are rum@@ ors of dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was dropped by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontane@@ ously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control as they prepare for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in the Scottish football bo@@ red Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National Elec@@ tor of The Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest to Celtic people , there is no title Ri@@ val@@ ity with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they are not highlights of the Celtic @-@ games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to watch these games .
I will rotate the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Celtic prince has to fight , but the Norwegian leader swore that things turn things around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent break from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stands out at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had a bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we all feel like that - but we must go on .
we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
together , it is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago that he pointed out that he arrived some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious in the signing of New Zealand and insi@@ sted that he doesn &apos;t want to inter@@ fere with the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season time to in@@ corporate what you saw with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes , more harm has been done by adding unnecessary players what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while rising in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent above the NSC 631570 level , as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( for dating only ) .
meanwhile employment was in Scotland around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the unemployment rate for Scotland decreased in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ o commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland met the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
during these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I am to be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will look on how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the Gi@@ fts .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first published in January by his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear myself .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a pri@@ mor@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is selected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , it will be more emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often when we speak .
the Pr@@ ison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ partial share .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the mate , as he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she thought she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international writer is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , one representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ dal act .
but I think that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters , in which you can turn .
what you can get of me is what it means to see a man unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police tracking out@@ ings , coming out of the Cann@@ ing River
Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z was dry when he talked to the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt to depend on a man from Perth to prevent the police , was un@@ successful when he was located in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , who tried to persu@@ ade him soft@@ ly , to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a house@@ break@@ age incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them into the Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uni@@ forms so he turned out a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people funny thing to try trying to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ sins drove his car into the tren@@ ches to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired them to the hum@@ anized planning of a Ben @-@ cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pro@@ pion@@ ate him and threat@@ ens racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables , and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he insi@@ sted on ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ a rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had been restra@@ ined 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to say nothing about it and I &apos;ve been eating for long , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that there was wide det@@ erg@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about the main driver , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had to upload the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had attempted to sp@@ ying out his pig .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked if I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my stron@@ gh@@ old , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should hold itself to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to believe me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and still are today .
should I bring me to the view that it personally will be ?
let Route L dis@@ cra@@ w strong behaviour and perhaps do people in charge of coaching responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now .
but I am at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it levels of train@@ ers have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt test in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could have &quot; cast &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ secured Master C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race tags as a &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s cart .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take on this full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ ed mud on the leg .
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday all day long , which was like that .
it had also been the same on race day .
Moo@@ dy might be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an inquiry into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people , who make these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all are seeing that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits mar@@ gins due to mar@@ gins due to mar@@ gins due to mar@@ gins
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has noted critics of his player &apos;s &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator has allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring @-@ fighting &quot; with his team during the high speed victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ ed note to the Storm @-@ Team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game &quot; sample of &quot; the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she only focuses on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of the two leaders in his team were confident that they were worried that they were worried about to become part of the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always shows up again - I didn &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring campaigns , when she had beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques all year , but in the past six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ kles on a real focus , and that made us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he probably is probably not used to lose it , it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is quite strange that this season is occurring again at the time of the season .
Bell@@ amy took the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with a &quot; boring &quot; soccer team .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that , in 2010 , St George was still a bo@@ red team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a shit about that .
but now he has a team that can play and which we are looking as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these .
I made strong confidence because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried not to play against us .
they didn &apos;t think about us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game of Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and don &apos;t points to any points ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention , it means we will meet in a phase still on them .
the Storm @-@ Team have free this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the finals in the A@@ AM@@ I Park on Saturday night . ticket sales will start tomorrow .
Ser@@ bs with 200,000 $ deposit to drug rules
a man , who may be a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the federal police passed 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for attempting to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , it argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café it could have been a harmless reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear links to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of the case , he lied to the police about his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ a &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a guarantee of $ 200,000 worth of security than security in order to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the sworn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars has a real financial burden , &quot; judge Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold it out of it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ ed from his Australian and his Serbian passport , taking on the police daily and starts at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone by girls to sing ped@@ oph@@ ile to sing images
an educ@@ ator used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to ask pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when he slept , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of unnecessary images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and found that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked through , the conf@@ using announ@@ c@@ ements and al@@ arms immediately found her mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five pictures , analysed later computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerned &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , the terms used in search of unknown images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g told the civil servants that he would have done it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave up a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson told the Dun@@ dee sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer of him , but said it was to be done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to co@@ ax them .
he said he was sick of the head when he drinks , and he said that he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson , &quot; when the girl took the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ or and on weeping .
she then looked at the un@@ attached pictures on the phone and confron@@ ted the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused were used computer and Play@@ station to talk to girls who looked a lot younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty to the indictment , un@@ attached images of children on the 14th of June of this year , to have viol@@ ated the charges brought to a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not to appear in the register of sexual off@@ ender , since they argued that there is no considerable sexual element in his dec@@ or .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael hurt the sentence until October to receive background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case ( caution but for hear@@ ings on others still outstanding ) in re@@ mand .
he was still taken up before the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tu@@ bing soft on small border transi@@ tions to Germany from
more refugees away from the major controversial attack on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks from fear of discovery and detention of men increases in smaller border crossing
to go out on the Austrian side , a national police spokes@@ man .
along the boundary of the river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been raised in the rural districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn in Tuesday .
they were on foot of bridges and dust ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
there they are taken in the position of federal police in order and for@@ warded for registration .
according to the German Police Department , on Wednesday the Main Police Station met again more refugees .
there are approximately 700 people in the capital city alone , and there are about 700 people in the country .

Stuttgart : extension of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in south@@ western Germany
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n before crash doors in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of an area of frozen rivers on Western Europe , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart .
the powerful T@@ ief is the master of the dri@@ pping tower &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled out over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda islands .
fierce storms and th@@ under@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest will also count towards the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance range between 60 and 90 kilometers per hour .
so the sun lets himself look back on Friday .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , primarily on the compact car , they are currently selling very well .
today , cars from the compact class are particularly high in demand : approximately 2@@ 8.1 percent of new appro@@ vals dropped to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Publi@@ cation date 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in the autumn .
the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice Institute of Justice given for months in a small cell .
because of the injury of their lives , det@@ ain@@ ees are fundament@@ ally entitled to financial compensation , when they are housed in small cells .
this decision was published by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can even wait for the judges when they were imprisoned for a few days in the spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in order to become an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , he was accommod@@ ated in a sol@@ itary confin@@ ement at Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man , who meanwhile had resi@@ ded on the other foot according to the information of his An@@ ders , had been laid to a larger cell .
his ten@@ ant rule was failed because of the in@@ geni@@ ous detention conditions against the State of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court lifted the judgment of the chamber of the Berlin chamber and returned the case for a renewed inspection .
they see human dignity by man &apos;s human rights .
Chamber of Kammer@@ s@@ thesis is decided on the height of the compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were author@@ itative , a compensation was given .
otherwise , &quot; a tum@@ ult of the legal justi@@ fication of the personality is to be feared . &quot;
the chamber needs to clari@@ fy the amount of money compensation .
the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they said only in April of that in@@ mate damages , because he was in prison naked in prison .
human un@@ worthy is to be a decision of 2011 , including the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
beyond that , Karlsruhe , on Wednesday , also confirmed the court ruling that an in@@ sol@@ ent accommodation was un@@ worthy in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took away from 15 to 21 hours a day in a same cell as in the Kar@@ ru@@ d case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were hit the headlines in recent weeks due to the lack of staff .
det@@ ain@@ ees would therefore always rise again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to stro@@ kes , should already come on because of the appropri@@ ated situation .
according to the claim@@ er , 21 positions are not occupied due to young people , 19 to be attacked in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to projections of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany in this year , following statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes in Germany , the following overview .
according to varying projections , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the German Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) are used every year and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatically , but above all for paid rental objects : every year 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social families are out of the lease @-@ price , and in order to apply for these particularly advant@@ ageous sites .
the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little has been seen from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 Socialist dwell@@ ings annually and this would have to invest a promotion of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal government minist@@ erial that there must be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , 55 percent of the poultry have been employed in Germany in the long @-@ term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically questioned about their qualification to help them when Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education at Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they can work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the recording method , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt , in Germany there was a political turning point : from the labour ban for refugees to recognise labour .
whereas previously banned from asylum seek@@ ers up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dences , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residential location .
in society , even because of the lack of skilled labour , the view is proved to be made easier for refugees to get access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational @-@ related language courses .
the study also shows that jobs are most often communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
the build @-@ up network is therefore , according to the position of Thr@@ ust@@ hardt from the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin School of Berlin has found that only a few out@@ dated parents give birth to their children in the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is only once more important to keep the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ bil@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kit@@ a , the administration sheets are distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly through the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the production capacity , by allowing it to access more technical schools .
students without German language classes will be prepared in the countries .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student union estimates that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State granted asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ eing the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ her@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
studies of study refugees could be facil@@ itated access to the university .
for refugees with a permit or dul@@ c@@ re , there are no performances according to the asylum seek@@ er Act more when they start studying .
the latter does not get a v@@ af@@ ö@@ v as they fall under the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ inal persons circuit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ged@@ ul@@ ate refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be eligible to be eligible for B@@ Af@@ o@@ G @-@ entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of January 1 , 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be reduced to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Schröder , Secretary of State for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ v .
Islam is going to play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important in their identity .
the state should be successive to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches claim to further develop a new state religion ratio .
the foundation of an Islamic @-@ welfare Association is important also to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representative of Islam must unite to clear , contact persons and be willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to back certain control options .
this also includes the read@@ iness to go on to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to ra@@ ve such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed the basic law to be translated .
integration will soon be much more than a topic of the whole society today .
this process will also change the majority of its majority shareholder , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination regulation and a general gender law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was learning very slowly , as the NSU trial series showed , in the police and authorities systematically igno@@ res the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ ch@@ ant@@ y@@ ish German have been demanding , and why international agreements shall become reality in the coming years if the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medi@@ cally care of the expected refugees to do so far , the doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery explains .
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money must be assigned to the system .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery , at the registration of health card , is required to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks .
the achievements could be completed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long @-@ term , it was highly question@@ able to rep@@ licate so many people with the limited performance catalog that the asylum seek@@ ers act .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors to abol@@ ish the language barriers .
even so far , so the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de established , migrants are worse than other patients to be identified .
not only in clinics , also medical practices and interpre@@ ting costs are required .
in total , many refugees too would be helped with more general medical centres during emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in the midst of refugee children there are notably more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people go to HIV education .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery serves some of the partial disease pictures of her training but clear , said Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ ill or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and what concerns the medical care is possibly mis@@ led by refugees even in sight .
the Syrians were a highly developed education system , and several refugees even were doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove its qualification and might have taken care of the ex@@ ams .
more than half of the refugees in Germany are suffering from lack of bund@@ les of bund@@ les ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable areas of refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study of TU Munich occupies that every fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering , among others , so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart nose and death squ@@ ats .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong terr@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers may pose a motion for a psycho@@ therapy , but the processing normally lasts several months .
in addition , social @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental disorders , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead frequently to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst goes back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw any age group in the B@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and making entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites in the ring on the brick @-@ wash@@ es to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie W@@ bst , animal teacher and junior youth in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current script production .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift for the delight of the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away the people from their everyday mo@@ ckery and take them for two hours to a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year old Junior College . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ bu@@ ds with World stadt @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
you will experience 50 cities on the barely 3 &apos; 000 miles long tour .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
in the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian st@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with a joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the dum@@ b films the Cuban duo wanted to take up the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s heart in the storm .
except through numerous salmon moti@@ ves the cir@@ cus of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tip and artic@@ ul@@ arity .

Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little other and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
the animals belong to our family , &quot; St. Stephen &apos;s Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus are just too often in different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also pic@@ ks up the position : &quot; if our animals are not good , it &apos;s not all good for us . &quot;
every match @-@ unit has about 80 animals from five different continents .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , is read by the eyes every request .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena .
the top commandment thus : good for the animals .
specifically on her pel@@ let jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ edge and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure , and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter if five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and always with their whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst will invite from 17 to 20 September a day at 17 to 20 o &apos;clock to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
a family day for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock is the price reduced .
in addition , the animal preview is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe is the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly via social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition that they had been anonymous and warned them against Mr. Mu@@ gabe was to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had hat@@ ched him and interrupted him during his speech in the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones which they war@@ ped before Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ les &apos;s address to inter@@ fere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after clearing this speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warns against the members of the European Parliament to end the immun@@ ity in Parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will create up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs within the framework of the company &apos;s restructuring and savings efforts .
hp will be split up this year into two listed companies and split computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ men and Chief Executive , who shall conduct the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and unified portfolio of shops that support companies with the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be concent@@ rating on providing integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930 &quot; s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and its Palo Alto Garage was called the Place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive re@@ structure to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that a very focused company provides a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger empha@@ sized to Wil@@ sh@@ er that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly want to miss at least the next four games for England and with its history its stake is certainly not uncertain at the next summer of the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ears had finished the last season after a separate kn@@ uck@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it &apos;s a bone , which healed not well .
this is no greater issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his Kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries which he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but rather recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player is trying to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developing an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses in Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 by Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 Lig@@ as@@ ar in the last five game times .
the wider painting for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 , most of the injuries in the world .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate is last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible time , a time where you must strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will have a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League events on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea du Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger will make a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia for Math@@ ieu Cou@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest a little break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started during the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby the Richter scale was 3,2 cm .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al removed the teaching of the past season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for males to open , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , such as su@@ ici@@ dal rates among young males in a 15 @-@ year @-@ high prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ amen ( CA@@ LM ) announced the year &apos;s Campaign against an inherited life in 2015 , with the aim of asking the culture in question that men are ob@@ struc@@ ting to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery had doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ consistency of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have the need to be strong , vital and successful , doubles , even when in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ gin@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all at cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can &apos;t buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on his head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler ( hu@@ gs ) , moments in swing work in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they are often back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of telephone calls it told me : ... &quot; My listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ endangered , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men that contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get ple@@ dged to be quite entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to offer long lasting magnetic mechanisms .
they presented clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status via telephone the people in moments of despair must also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit the weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ festival with the back@@ drop of the day , why don &apos;t you pick up your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent at the start of comedy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G in order to cr@@ ush Malmö .
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani based on Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PS@@ G wins in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game &apos;s report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani went on course to Paris Saint @-@ Germain to win his Champions League &apos;s season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria did less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who put the French Master on the way , but afterwards , they changed a number of opportunities before she finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish teacher , since it could not only stri@@ ve for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ 4 laps , but improvement on the way to quar@@ ter@@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they were given the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics , adapted opportunities before the gate . he later became in play against his home @-@ town team and against the association with which he started his k@@ har@@ k@@ ic career already in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our counter problems and look back , even if there are certain things we must have been perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret it , that we haven &apos;t had one or two more goals . &quot;
just prior to his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris Team , this weekend was a 2 : 2 un@@ decided to hold its own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was em@@ itted in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
on the last month of Manchester United , the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing@@ ed pillar has been called the man to take over the next level of Manchester United in the last month , and he sign@@ alled when he was standing in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis watch behind the Malmö government before he ended up in Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic voyage beat a Play @-@ off , in order to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine west players on the field and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground breaking a serious enemy .
but out of a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s role in the 3@@ 4th minute , they cra@@ ck little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G even got up , but with some failure and bad agreements , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was pat@@ ched at no less than five attempts solely in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ate to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria into a shooting shot , which was landed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
at last , the second gate fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er had its sixth year , after imp@@ lo@@ red a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all the thoughts that Malmö to find in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could low before the end player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later , gave that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion @-@ League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not suff@@ ice from . &quot;
waiting in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world Champion and European Champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago in front of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times Champions League winner , two victories Club champion , two times European champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer of the meantime , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .

&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we didn &apos;t tell anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a supply of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; people wanted me to have me . &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown did shocked , shocked nonsense and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . &quot; okay , when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened himself .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Sh@@ eb@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to think people to think about it - whoever will always handle the director - like she &apos;s the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown initially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is beaten by their white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People , the producer of Dear White People , was interested in the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film . Dam@@ on said their direction &quot; at the end of us could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;

Dam@@ ons comments are coming at a time when the exact racial representation in the media lies at the top of the social discussion .

&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning , ) he said .
like books and black life , albums are still on their meaning .

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport@@ sman and operation carrier Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which was just finished in its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could finish all steps of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finals .
on the final part , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was finished in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended up the task within the period to which he completed the first athl@@ ete , which ended the demanding phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds qu@@ icker , making it a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock over the prize of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his lot of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as quite suddenly ... as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter driving the final and why B@@ ritten , although he finished first at the circuit , not just any prize money won .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fastest time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .

he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he won the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as much as you would have changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was pro@@ lon@@ gs for a season season and fil@@ ming will start in early 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ p@@ ses to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ I , the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , however , this part played perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb in a play of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to summar@@ ize for a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Excell@@ ent .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held an early offensive support , when Detroit acted three times at the first two quarters , then in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three ranks .
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ ps every game , and therefore I will very focus into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against Seattle se@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the drums well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it right into the game .
with three rounds at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to return to play .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ xton completed the inning with a double on the left lane line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon launched his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced with Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy &apos;s left @-@ h@@ ander .
Har@@ dy handed over the wall , the only man faced with whom he was confron@@ ted in front of the newly designated ro@@ ok@@ ie guy Miguel S@@ ano who took a two @-@ run for the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w .
with a pair of le@@ vers and the finale @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the major league in the major league the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ghs has hit a double play
following Detroit at the end of the ninth anniversary we added a R@@ BI double directed against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander pointed out S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benef@@ ited the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers captured three R@@ uns in the first two ings against the right @-@ handed b@@ ans , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the injuries list , after he had been lacking for a month over a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted me , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; but I feel better when I detached and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ einer gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z passed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which was the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat them particularly well , but he has caught the right spot .
Hughes had no points in a pitch @-@ Count on the pitch , before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , we came to three hits of six hits and a walk with four sha@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez retired due to a violation of the lim@@ iting school .
he is investig@@ ating Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sán@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the injuries list , due to a shoulder blade , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the injuries list in order to win the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris started with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was first purchased with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he had been lacking for a cutting in the right th@@ igh since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target field on Wednesday

no diet fruit - man@@ ganese included a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line , they are often more de@@ comp@@ uted .
because they contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruit is still healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all , they contain a lot of vitamins A and the pre @-@ stage beta car@@ otene .
whoever eats the fruit , thus supports se@@ at@@ ability , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or firm to smell .
the form@@ work color alone sp@@ ends nothing about how ripe fruit is - so also green leaves can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within days .
then they taste natural , naturally or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives a special touch but also warm dishes .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter flavor of some green salads such as ch@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

Luther had then initiated the split of the Hungarian Church in his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main pieces made by the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and scrip@@ ted translations .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt who puts in 150 moti@@ ves his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful paints and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means , this is by no means &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the relevant topics can be quite dark .
around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt did not work on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a sub@@ jective impressions from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles , which relate to themes like crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : that is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt face on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites .
he interpreted the Bible Pro@@ files selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into the today , into current inter@@ relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible map of Martin Luther and a proposition of the artist who puts his whole personal thoughts on their respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden g@@ its .
this allows the 75 year old to double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotion ultimately became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; the up@@ bringing came together with the pi@@ pel@@ ines , &quot; re@@ members by Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out to work with the Lord my father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art in quick@@ ness time again . &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is min@@ ted today by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being p@@ ushes out there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have a mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers go down into the pictures , &quot; letting them look , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; Al@@ ways always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like he can compreh@@ end with his paintings . &quot;
old , I don &apos;t seem to understand the Bible completely , but selected for him important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; it was not a collaboration to eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; was a copy of the Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ hler , the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and cloth pictures - will be presented at an exhibition for the first time at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn arrives
plans made , place found , businesses were instructed to model@@ ed the door@@ ke@@ gel for a circuit : one year later it was completed - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was over .
visions in politics and administration were preparing for dr@@ ink@@ ers , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
thus , hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first municipal law of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , for children and youth affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still be a clear thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be done without a &quot; additional practice break &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga puts a clear signal at the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the sp@@ ying situation in Germany and secure the policy of its aid in tac@@ kling the standing problems .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; nobody can tell nobody in principle , that &apos;s nothing for me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every individual care about the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ sively want to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the law Chancell@@ ery and meet the State Secretary Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ j@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he quit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must stop politics .
the German national soccer federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 to a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains ren@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ v@@ ein will show a clear signal when they appear on the left tri@@ cot , otherwise the usual sponsor@@ ship name ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone can help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting director Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football states , no , we need to utili@@ ze our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already been so incredibly successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ pag@@ ms Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of one of the prominent characters of the league . &quot;
at the European Court of Quali@@ fication on Friday , women team charge 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a large collabor@@ ator of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences can be launched in their own projects , be great .
it is as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nir@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP directors loses an eye accident
chief of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost several reports by a fall in early July the left eye .
after the accident during his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a glass @-@ glass at midnight , which he carried on the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ eds , I was power@@ less in the street - he told us this last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could carry out his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met before the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was working with the meeting and &quot; full of work . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to show the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I became a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t in the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him that such a personal story would go to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; anyone can happen anything like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot;

occ@@ er : Bv@@ E without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller at the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the First World Play of the Europa League finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the soccer league in the Bundesliga in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t return to him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga &apos;s top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach said : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high bur@@ dening of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or in the EU@@ s position .
so he quit playing a change at the gate position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of St@@ art@@ ender Roman Hei@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion .
whether the f@@ eller belongs to the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
at high probability , he will also deny the second game .
the pursu@@ it of Brother Con@@ cep@@ ts that the final step for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League has to be the aim of tra@@ ce@@ able Julian Wei@@ gl as : &quot; thus , Marco does not lie so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
Germany , following the will of the Federal Government , should be a technological pioneer in accordance with the will of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper issued by Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less stress , the Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart , the G7 , and also with representatives of industry .
the federal Ministry of Commerce emphas@@ ises the importance of a mobile broadband design and a generous focus on digital radio stations .
to test new technology , a test line is currently being launched on the 9 highway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional port risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verify the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany aims to use some internationally applicable that the permissible vehicle for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
moreover , the Federal Government will also opt for a change in the Vi@@ enn@@ ese agreement that only sees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car will take over lead the lead , the driver will become more and more to the passenger .
technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that en@@ vis@@ es the environment and process data into seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to come far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving capabilities on location Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA study comes to a result that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent are only to believe that 31 percent do not believe anything at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed have by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital publishing area , only seven percent would agree to pass control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway we could even introduce 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the station of St@@ au 45 percent .
a good every V@@ ent would leave the car under any circumstances .

B@@ oll was at that time agreed on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the World Ran@@ kings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier doesn &apos;t feel too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wat@@ cht@@ let @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett . designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) will be presenting an exhibition about his work at Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins display , which are frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who , amongst others , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he was infected men in Rö@@ ck .
&quot; I can &apos;t tell you today that I &apos;m a fan of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very easy to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Am@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown in the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed its kind to an exhibition about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition is a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when dies , one comes into the museum .
the stunning collection had previously done before the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just nice clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s barely visible work , which has written fashion history without having ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed universal artwork , which was used for a lot of effort : to stop the dolls , a styl@@ ist was engaged for example .
14 tons of material did the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of October , there was another special treat : a leather she@@ er out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are l@@ ur@@ k than men &quot; ) , and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said .
an artist &apos;s old ted@@ dy Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender mo@@ ve@@ able side@@ ways of the designer .
when a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was clothed with Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
if his parents had not allowed him to play with a doll , his parents had not allowed him .
the dis@@ card of fashion he taught himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as G@@ aul in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ot@@ ch tip as fashion icon
it used to be on the long se@@ wing machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make metres .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips developed in great amount for customers , which , for example , re@@ worked to bl@@ ank@@ ets and gar@@ ages .
today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ir@@ ons .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the initial times of pl@@ au@@ sp@@ ies played fashion a greater part , was then p@@ ou@@ sted by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls several examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage mode , which leans against the past bull , is an increasing the potential .
those who do not operate on the textile industry in Germany is no longer available in the market .
they have already made half of our orders .
Mo@@ ck@@ yard Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ ener Pl@@ aying and Sti@@ cker@@ ries together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to bear the registered label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover are made .
private specialty stores and also wholesale are almost no longer .
our products hardly make our clients on this road .
these mass ware will largely be produced in the Asian region , and almost exclusively sold over chains .
furthermore , exports are exported to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new routes .
the industry association has also been trying to score points such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ bl@@ le in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce eco @-@ ecological and soci@@ ally vulnerable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
a diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger holding office of the West@@ Sax@@ on School of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which must mostly think of economically , is developed .
therefore , a existing design may only be easily varied to maintain a customer base .
some years ago the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ designed the historic pace of snow .
the machine sp@@ ends some small ch@@ icks in some places .
the pl@@ ot@@ ted Gold@@ sch@@ mie@@ de Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se had inspired them : &quot; I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ aying tip . &quot;
now it uses the Snow@@ ball tip for their jewellery .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure , she defines the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it is also delivered to the U.S. , to Australia and to Finland - mainly due to customers whose ancestors were living in pl@@ ets and surroundings and want to have a piece of commem@@ oration .
thus I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

XI is p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
the economy has to open its bro@@ ader approach to further growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group who was commissioned with the steering system &apos;s steering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and start reforms of new moment@@ um and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity on regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , funding of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population system .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity @-@ list will be identified , sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it indicates the market a bigger role in the allocation of resources , a legally binding business environment and the market open , said the statement .
the government also will ease controls on the firm transmitted powers , and make sure companies decide how to carry out their businesses .
the statement also said that China border areas will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , nation@@ ally controlled sectors open , further areas for private investments are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will safegu@@ ard the lawful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by optim@@ ised the requirements and the application process will be reli@@ eved .
the right to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limits in pre@@ dat@@ or @-@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ or and make consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding student paper for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and adverse events failed with full impact on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is believed to have a limit of the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that , based on the still valid limits , some 50 percent of the length must not be sold .
after dup@@ lication of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be dis@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ ley described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p mostly bur@@ dened as low as car@@ p , that they keep the planned maximum values today .
the lowering of water is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ xation di@@ ver who helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is one of the people highly toxic heavy metal that en@@ rich itself heavily in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; low amounts may also cause serious damage to the &quot; nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat of general population &quot; would not be expected .
mercury is characterized by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Green , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ gen ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of them em@@ itted in Germany .
