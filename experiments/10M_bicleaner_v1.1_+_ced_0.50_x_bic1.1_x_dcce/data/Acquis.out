it occurs on the first day of the month in force that follows the day that the last of the contract parties has deposited their acceptance in the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This additional prot@@ rac@@ oll , however , occurs after two years after the time in force , to which it was attached to the adoption , unless one of the parties have noted a objection against its entry into force .
from that point onwards a state can not become a party of the Convention without simultaneously to the Parties of the additional protocol .

a re@@ agent to the blood @-@ group assignment must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is the an@@ tigen , the antibody or the other on the label al@@ olo@@ g .
if a re@@ agent in which is recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) ugly qualities ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by ever new di@@ lution of the audi@@ ting re@@ agent to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the overall volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on the object carrier , the activity is required by the time that is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agent for the blood @-@ group@@ ing international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , are prepared at the time standards .
a International standard table contains according to definition a certain number of inter @-@ national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ans , which are observed in individual preparations . ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ ation is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tes , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution near an er@@ y@@ thro@@ zy@@ ten@@ acity .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series that occurs at a microsc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , for the International standard pre@@ occupation exists ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard policy or state of State standards ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a repository is recommended under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required characteristics should be retained for at least one year .
the expiry date of a rec@@ agent in fluid form according to label is at most a year after the last satisfactory turmoil .
the resulting exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is geared towards the results of the shelf @-@ attempt ; it is approved by government agencies .
dr@@ y@@ re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or vacuum , and in the glass container , in which they are dried , and which is locked so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dr@@ y@@ re@@ agent must lose less than 0.@@ 02 mm of its weight by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide with a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm h@@ g within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the relevant state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the use of the dry @-@ re@@ agents ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added that the re@@ agent will continue to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ group@@ ings for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for blood group@@ ings should not be colored as if possible , at least until a Internation@@ ales Convention has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents to the blood @-@ group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that in a container repository , not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity you are looking into a container must be so great that the contents may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy steps described in this protocol .
the manufacturer of production has about all production levels and checks of re@@ agents to re@@ group@@ ing their written records .
proper samples of all selected re@@ agents are to keep up such a long way from the laboratory , up to some probability , the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agent of the re@@ agents used can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintaining stability of the re@@ agents .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to their effective reference in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
on every single tank , a black on white printed label in English and French can be attached to the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid consumed .
in addition , this label or the label on the cart@@ on , in which the individual containers are located , or those charged the vessels to contain the following information : 1 . complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
