this document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ gress Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the Pack@@ ungs@@ be@@ aks ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 15 mg , and 30 mg enam@@ elled tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to setup ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and madness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high mood ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe severe episodes and the prevention of dietary episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied or the melting pot in patients may be applied to which the ab@@ stain@@ ing of tablets difficulties are prepared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are just like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bili@@ fy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dose of bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably appears mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent acts as the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to enable the recept@@ ors to activate .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin from schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents her re@@ occur .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which compared to increased unrest during a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ eb@@ i@@ dol , in a different study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been re @-@ perform at 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy injections was evaluated in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that were placed on heigh@@ tened unrest , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melting pot and the solution to take resor@@ bed ( absorbed ) .
in the two studies conducted with the injection solution patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in cans of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies were more effective than placebo .
bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , extr@@ apol@@ ation , Tre@@ at@@ ol@@ enz ) , se@@ dation ( sle@@ ep@@ tic ) , se@@ dation ( br@@ ation ) , saliva hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased saliva production ) , ti@@ redness and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes relate to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee agreed that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transpor@@ tations of bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or coma therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
having regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients should be considered a lower initi@@ ald@@ dose when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is dischar@@ ged from the combin@@ ant therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ pra mental behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or switching of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even if treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no increased risk of addiction to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cerebral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that apply for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ pressur@@ izing medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including par@@ cel@@ tic and mal@@ ignant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which were a year or less diges@@ ted , there were occasional reports of during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ id arthritis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be dis@@ continued .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with kr@@ amp@@ er in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or on states that are linked with cr@@ amp@@ ons in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a raised mortality rate compared to the placebo .
there were however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed d@@ osing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undes@@ er@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ coma or death , was reported in patients infected with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug @-@ related patients to allow direct comparisons .

a weight gain is generally seen in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic entities , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with itself over@@ lay side effects such as se@@ dation . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a ga@@ stri@@ c blo@@ cker , reduces the resi@@ du@@ tion rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered to be clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , an extremely effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) has remained the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l about 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin @-@ reductions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metals .
if you consider using a common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ectors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin @-@ reductions .
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the beginning of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ val concentrations .
in clinical trials reported doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day does not have any significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ color@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal safety studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , patients should be warned about to be warned dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than placebo or were deemed as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ism , a total reduced incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , acrylic , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ il@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ lan@@ ation therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ operated i@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term experience of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for those treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side @-@ effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch have been un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional trans@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ on sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is due to the treatment of over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plastic use .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at schizophrenia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
with gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0,5 @-@ 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the loyalty of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or lig@@ ands , on the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and by the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ ated i@@ dol controlled trial was 52 the share of Respon@@ sible patients who attended a reference to the study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ co@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the scales , which were defined as secondary education , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Stri@@ ke @-@ scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ co@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks at stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia , a significantly higher reduction of resi@@ dual rates , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ Zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study conducted with schizophrenia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients performed under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l a compared to placebo @-@ le@@ ased effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two Plac@@ ebo@@ - and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an effect compared with placebo or half @-@ operating effects that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ co@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also referred to 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia , such as lithium or Hal@@ co@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks do not affect Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , revealed the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing mal@@ icious symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , which had reached a re@@ mission ahead with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo with regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar relap@@ se , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se into the mania .
based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ cy@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ dy is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ wer@@ age is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ yn@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a special @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ mo@@ co@@ ine@@ tik revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ co@@ ar@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on impairment of liver disease on Phar@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security analysis , toxicity in repe@@ atable gift , reproduction , toxicity , and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers to recognise the human being .
toxic@@ ological effects are only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ pig@@ ment ( AU@@ C ) at rats for 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 60 mg / kg / car@@ cin@@ oma ) at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ ly of the middle Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the de@@ colon@@ isation of sul@@ ph@@ ur con@@ ju@@ gate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3@@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the results found in human genetics at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations that have been found in the study of 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far under the margin@@ al values ( 6 % ) of the vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady state of AU@@ C at the recommended clinical Maxim@@ ald@@ osis .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at schizophrenia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ Zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study conducted with schizophrenia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients performed under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , where the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form at healthy volunteers , lay the relationship between the geom@@ etric C@@ max medium value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 capsules , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the de@@ colon@@ isation of sul@@ ph@@ ur con@@ ju@@ gate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3@@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady state of AU@@ C at the recommended clinical Maxim@@ ald@@ osis .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injections will be applied to the rapid control of axi@@ om and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be completed and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the Res@@ or@@ ation and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ id or deep within the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under byp@@ assing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the drug or acute therapy required ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to setup .
there are no tests on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injections in patients with axi@@ om and behavi@@ oral disorders that were unlike both schizophrenia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines will be considered as necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cerebral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that apply for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ pressur@@ izing medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including par@@ cel@@ tic and mal@@ ignant form ) .

clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ f@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ i , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally seen in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic entities , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect and lead to severe complications and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the dation was greater compared to that after all the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , used in the healthy pro@@ ban@@ ana Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a par@@ tram@@ way in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular and at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tra @-@ muscular .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin @-@ reductions .
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the beginning of the companion therapy .

the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral att@@ aches to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS is 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long term experience of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for those treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ opho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side @-@ effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was compared with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of axi@@ om / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ co@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 2@@ 91 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as axi@@ om and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference .
the observed average improvement of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Comp@@ on@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ assemblies in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe incidence , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical summary could be determined due to a decreased patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) an 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ ated i@@ dol controlled trial was 52 the share of Respon@@ sible patients who attended a reference to the study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ co@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depress@@ ants , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ co@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks at stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia , an significantly higher reduction of resi@@ dual rates , which was 34 % in arith@@ me@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin ( oral ) group and at 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study conducted with schizophrenia over 26 weeks , comprising 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study of &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced to significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which partly do not affect Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , revealed the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing mal@@ nutrition symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study of man@@ ic patients , which had reached a re@@ mission before Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself against placebo in terms of prevention of bi@@ polar relap@@ se , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se into the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers were the mean time to reaching the maximum plastic pi@@ per at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in any direct toxicity of a target @-@ organ after repeti@@ tive gift with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which lay 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
in studies dealing with intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns for mat@@ ern@@ al exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for san@@ iti@@ ze , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers to recognise .
toxic@@ ological effects are only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ pig@@ ment ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ish @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) and an increase of renal col@@ en@@ al gland during 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold @-@ middle @-@ state @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been found as a result of the de@@ colon@@ isation of sul@@ ph@@ ur con@@ ju@@ gate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3 @-@ fold the middle @-@ state @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed according to doses , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11 @-@ times of middle @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical Maxim@@ ald@@ osis .

the efficacy of abra@@ sion was examined in a primary study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ sion ( in all@@ any administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug @-@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with abra@@ sive patients treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs received .
considering only the patients treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ related drugs .
it may also be used in patients who are silent or before the treatment of low neutr@@ ons pay in the blood .
the drug for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) noted that my@@ x@@ ane in patients where the first treatment was no longer regarded , more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained drugs , and that it must not be given to other drugs in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Bio@@ Science Limited a approval for the transpor@@ ting of abra@@ sion in the whole of the European Union .
abra@@ sion @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic disease in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ lean number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the abra@@ sion therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sensory neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 is the treatment dis@@ rupt , until a bet@@ tering is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data available to the recommendation of Dos@@ age adap@@ tations in patients with upper impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ sion is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
abra@@ sion is an album @-@ used nan@@ op@@ articles by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be deduc@@ ted and symptom@@ atic treatment should be introduced , and the patient must not be treated once again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new abra@@ sion @-@ treatment program should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ lean number increases to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased the thy@@ ro@@ id number again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( be@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sion .
while a clearly identified with abra@@ sion related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity is not proven , cardi@@ ac incidents in the inde@@ xed patient collective is not uncommon , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart illness or lung disease .
if in the patient , after the gift of abra@@ sion sickness , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ pe@@ dic@@ ine and con@@ sti@@ cking resources .
abra@@ sion should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age that do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with my@@ x@@ ane a reliable combustion method .
male patients who are treated with abra@@ sion is advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised before the treatment over a sperm reduction , since therapy with abra@@ sion is the possibility of irrever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ sion can cause side effects as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machines .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mam@@ mal car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion .
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( at 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ y ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed by 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 the side @-@ effects listed in combination with the gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy with each dose and indication occurred in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules which promotes the contrac@@ tion of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular In@@ m@@ eren and stabili@@ ze the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ sis .
these stabili@@ zation results in a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the co@@ otic cell functions .
it is well @-@ known that it conv@@ eys the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and has been demonstrated within @-@ vit@@ ro studies that the presence of Alb@@ ay@@ ax@@ el enhances the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ i@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Album @-@ counter and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ator Prot@@ eins ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the use of abra@@ sion for metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed studies and by 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study .
in a study conducted 43 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma treated in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ sive reaction 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ elled general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ van@@ ishing treatment .

the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear of 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of abra@@ sion in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation took on a multi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ astic distribution and / or past@@ ure delivery of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solution @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the abra@@ sion @-@ administration higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ sized Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at my@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the average total dose of 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance .
however , over 75 years of age , only a few data are available , as only 3 patients participating in the pharmac@@ o@@ tic analysis participated .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original C@@ art@@ on and in front of light light protected over 8 hours .

• Educational brochures • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( subject information ) , lab@@ eling and packages . • An unique display of the correct application of the product accidentally boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that inter@@ sect a biological medicine is similar to which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also &quot; reference terminology &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood circulation , in which to occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case the procedure is not possible , and at which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with se@@ wage must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood @-@ bla@@ zing company , se@@ ams is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his advisor , provided that they have obtained adequate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the skins values should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ b deficiency or by giving the body not sufficiently attached to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ sect was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , which was caused by kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia as compared with the reference point .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were either rep@@ lic@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were examined by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients infected with kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ mo@@ th@@ ie@@ ves of patients were re@@ amed on dis@@ sect , maintained in the same measure as with the patient who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , steady @-@ orient@@ ated headaches and con@@ fu@@ sions lead .
insec@@ t may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ dition as an injection led by the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been produced according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , consoli@@ dating the execution will provide information about the medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .

treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ B &#93; 10 - 13 g / d@@ l &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , not to be available or inadequate in case of planned larger surgical procedures required ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
the reduction of foreign blood can be used in front of a large ele@@ ology treatment in adults without any iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / d@@ l ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied not to participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood @-@ endemic program .
the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except with pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , where the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation occurred between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ esthe@@ tic symptoms and tor@@ tured can vary depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ ost@@ ins by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in one patient individual skins values via or under the h@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target @-@ concentration .
in view of this hem@@ ost@@ asis system should be tried through an appropriate dosage management , the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the Hä@@ ber@@ bell is worth more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent tick @-@ globe @-@ value 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % .

anthrop@@ ic symptoms and - follow @-@ ups can vary depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ ost@@ asis system should be tried through an appropriate dosage management , the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

in case of patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evidence @-@ resistant coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ genital heart failure should not be exceeded by Section 4.2 the upper boundary of the hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa at adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated .
in tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin answer ( patients who may have to be trans@@ co@@ ded ) .

the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ etine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the participation of the respective patient who should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are envis@@ aged for a greater ele@@ ology surgery should , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy examined the cause of an@@ a@@ emia and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a major ele@@ ology procedure should get an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic prophy@@ la@@ xis if they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ ban and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in case of treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a first @-@ fashioned globe @-@ value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ ban / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , the epo@@ chs did not prove that they can improve the overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our cancer .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase of blood pressure , or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ et@@ inen .

there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative effect on the overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results have been treated on the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a tick @-@ globe under 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients included with these characteristics in the audi@@ ted data included .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes up the bones ) both for women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high load risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a least trau@@ matic hip . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting in a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms resulting in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus paste , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
as the substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a portion of the data material was attracted for Zom@@ eta to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly eight 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of typ@@ ho@@ ons and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indication for the effectiveness was whether the salary of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( a enzyme which builds up the bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney cancer , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors that ent@@ ails Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the clu@@ es of how the medicine is applied , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • near post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip .
treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended to two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be Ac@@ la@@ sta only prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long run period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , an initi@@ ald@@ from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is making an Initi@@ al or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion recommended .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta will not be recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A Dos@@ age adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and juven@@ iles under 18 years of age , because data is missing for in@@ sensitivity and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences exist .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ oc@@ emia is before the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick entry of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone construction can develop a temporary , mit@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
additionally it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ted before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental attacks , no data is available , whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral area .
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect cases of alleg@@ ation occurred among patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients whose placebo received ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of accus@@ ations between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney @-@ cell Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is referred to as an increase in the renal function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) , and in rare cases as acoustic kidney failure .
the modification of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure , as well as a reduced kidney function , were comparable in a clinical trial at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years , between the acet@@ one and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which treated below the normal range of fluctu@@ ations ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in comparison to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get &apos;s treated patients .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study of avoiding clinical frac@@ tures following a frac@@ tion@@ frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , after a recently reduced hip , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a great clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral area was occasionally used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the oral area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ate , including customs cl@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extraction , or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients took charge of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the oral area with an account of Ac@@ la@@ sta and one with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved by gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once annual for 3 consecutive years has been illustrated with either a bone density ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 ) and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing ver@@ teb@@ rates or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the th@@ ig@@ h &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ rates .

Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ employed patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % decreased risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta reported a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at the handle@@ bars , hip , and dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significant to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of bone density of the handle@@ bar at 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h tot@@ aling 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.@@ 2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ographic - ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed it to be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo for increasing bone loss and maintaining the traditional bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d des Type @-@ I@@ - Kol@@ collagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in the Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ assemblies from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months substantially increased by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the start @-@ up to 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror have not been rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total income was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .

the study was not designed to indicate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures amoun@@ ted to 7.5 % to Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison with once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at referred to the percentage modification of the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ t @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined for patients aged over 30 years , especially light up to moderate mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases according to 2.@@ 6@@ times up to 3,@@ 0@@ ,000 @-@ specific upper levels of inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic , compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain strength and pain modification , compared to the output value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were specified at the end of six month &apos;s main study as Respon@@ sible ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients participating in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained during 141 of the patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 the patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , in the middle duration of the after@@ math of 18 months after the application .

the early stages of the phases ( α and β with the above ½ values ) probably represent the rapid resolution into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains untreated by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clear@@ ance @-@ concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) .
a diminished Clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic substances is unlikely because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet met@@ aboli@@ zed at humans , and because it is a wa@@ xy or even no direct and / or irrever@@ sible , subtle In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human therapeutic agents , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
an over@@ working R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on security , the phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • within 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ idal or risk minim@@ ization ) was achieved . • At the request of the E@@ MEA region .
Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class that is called on@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly o@@ estrogen made of andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone construction too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta affects the bone construction again norm@@ alized , thereby guaranteeing normal bone formation and thus l@@ ends the bone once again .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or recently taken / used even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know whether you are taking medicine , known by which she is the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are worried that you take sufficient fluid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may possibly need a further dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta missed , Set@@ zen will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering the c@@ ess@@ ation of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occurs very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , however , are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms at yourself after you received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs due to low cal@@ ci@@ dal concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amping or kri@@ b@@ aking or numb feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

continued pain and / or not cur@@ able wounds in the mouth or in the ja@@ ws were reported primarily in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , net@@ tles and angi@@ o@@ e@@ des ( such as swelling at the face , the tongue or in the throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the specified side effects you significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice any side effects that are not listed in these usage information .
if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage periods and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the quick entry of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic on the bone construction can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ oc@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
additionally it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice a day of 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ cing frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is called or@@ ically or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ gress Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) can not be applied . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in only in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ace or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; it should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ym@@ ous and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar level is sin@@ king , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ar , in addition they received either accounts or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
accounts led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels at the application of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts on existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ingredient in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study conducted in which the combination of accounts and insulin is examined at 2@@ 89 patients , patients receiving accounts in addition to insulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to the patient which additionally took placebo .
the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual defects , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( diminished sensitivity to irritation ) .
accounts may not be used in patients who may have to be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ( high ket@@ on@@ ism - se@@ ag@@ ro@@ gel - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for authorisation for marketing of accounts in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood@@ sugar is inadequate and in@@ compatibility with which met@@ form@@ ers is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intolerance ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
applying Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients infected by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician ought to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and oils , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in this study , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in case of patients with increased output liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper boundary of norm@@ alization ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to the 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes will be re @-@ controlled as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point out on a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , colon@@ el , fatigue , appetite , and / or darker har@@ n , are the liver enzymes to review .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the provision of the Laboratory parameters are led by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fat deposits , and in some cases associated with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ ties , the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ otherapy and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity there is patients who have pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or as a branch therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the launch of the market , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ an indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ generation with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular de@@ ms , if patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages im@@ desirable events regarding bone bro@@ kers from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ tures was 1.9 freight @-@ up pro 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , women and 1,@@ 1 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro @-@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures from 44 / 8@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is rep@@ licated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ologic or pharmaceutical dynamics of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with pharmaceuticals , which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase are not expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the bra@@ kes inde@@ xes of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ rises above the triple of the norm@@ als of the norm@@ als , however , often referred to as under placebo but less than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ oses .
in an out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency increased by 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or on the basis of placebo .
since the market launch has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of messages im@@ desirable events regarding bone bro@@ ther@@ es from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated in those treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in patients with compar@@ atively medi@@ cally examined groups .
in over a period of 3.5 years ongoing trial , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance increases .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to examine the time until retro@@ fitting of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy started a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ eable study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate in spite of a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - worth 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patient , which continued to be only insulin ; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on group was observed .

the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , limited examination of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma @-@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as insignificant , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ D@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .

after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the highest concentration on un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma is usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV does not correspond to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in response studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on Phar@@ mo@@ co@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral use of radio@@ active market pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the res@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all of the active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the parent is similar .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar level were similarly strong as with another human being .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human@@ eness ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ sugar ( see the full list is the Pack@@ ungs@@ be@@ acon ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ap@@ han@@ e predomin@@ ate in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e throughout the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , if a rapid initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection na@@ ve must be at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose has inj@@ ected .

any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human or insulin method ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNS compared to insulin in animal origin ) can cause a modification of the dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e a dosage adjustment is required for the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , the patient should go about several times , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travels may cause that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the treatment of therapy and always ask for others about drugs taken by them .

this document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ gress Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
the pharmaceutical is an effective component in Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the procedure of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id should not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
furthermore , doses of acet@@ ap@@ id could possibly be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin is mixed , first the amount of the rapidly working insulin must be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 if switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient a dosage adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , the patient should go about several times , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travels may cause that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .

the effect begins within half an hour , the active max is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and teenagers ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assumption that the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile among children and young people is similar to that of adults .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied by patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ lim@@ b notes ( &quot; stones . &quot; i.e. greater judgement deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary tract can still be more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg .
during the first treatment months , still pl@@ y@@ ancy may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even more medicines to prevent cancer prevention .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to a placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicinal product for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of once daily by 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary arm@@ our in the blood was under 6 mg / d@@ l in the blood of the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patient , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg recorded daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients , which took once daily 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nau@@ seas ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart defects in the pre @-@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases that have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the medical history known or currently available in Gi@@ cht@@ al and / or a g@@ il@@ arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um sa@@ ws gel after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered an increase of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney functioning , the effectiveness and safety have not yet been fully examined ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people have no experiences with children and young people , the use of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

cardiovascular diseases in patients with isch@@ a@@ esthes@@ ia or de@@ hydr@@ ated heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ ur@@ ination medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to a acute pl@@ aster procedure , because by lowering the ser@@ um sa@@ id@@ ur@@ chin area first of the ur@@ inary deposits in the tissue can be mobil@@ ised .
B. with mal@@ ignant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 , light abnormalities of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function before the beginning of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure and in the course of course , depending on clinical assessments ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was conducted no exchange studies to Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ p can lead to a rise of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line @-@ table ( a shirt of the metast@@ orization of The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .

animal experimental studies do not have a direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful on taxes of a vehicle , use of machines or the exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be somewhat certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point was in every study of the proportion of patients with whom the last three months were given certain ser@@ um sa@@ ws levels &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed significant significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um cancer ( 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were consolidated for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of the ser@@ um belts to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently on the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancers &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function limiting the AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functioning ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point has been reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration at Pro@@ ban@@ den , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid Con@@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l about 40 % of the patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the ser@@ um sa@@ ws at &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) caused a decrease of the incidence of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a gyp@@ sy type ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction of pl@@ ot@@ al code , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the poison no@@ de to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open @-@ long term studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations @-@ Time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration simpler and multi@@ pler cans of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportionate increase .
after in@@ gesting simple or multi @-@ pl@@ az@@ ed doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state @-@ department volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after in@@ gesting doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ le delivery of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is above the concentration width , which is achieved with c@@ cans of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro trials at human liver micro@@ bes showed that these oxid@@ ative metals are formed primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ x@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose occurred in urine as an un@@ changing Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ron@@ es ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion about urine , approximately 45 % of the dose were found in the chair as an un@@ changing Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ron@@ es and its Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to progression with normal kidney function .
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1,8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ . h / ml in group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ in h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

ages There have been no significant changes with regard to AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or whose met@@ abol@@ ites after in@@ gestion multi @-@ oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impairment of the Fer@@ til@@ isation For male rats has been found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary recept@@ ors ( Transi@@ tional pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ do@@ ered group , with approximately 11 times of exposure to humans , found .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine composition , and for clinical use than not relevant .
it has been found that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and re@@ production capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which occurred approximately 4.@@ 3@@ - times of human therapeutic exposure , maternal tox@@ iz@@ ations , occurred with a reduction in performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies on tra@@ den@@ ying rats with ex@@ positions that bore approximately the 4.@@ 3 @-@ fold and with tra@@ verse rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that bore approximately the 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ ting other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient is allowed to take up until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines used in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and the published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 males and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D mirror in the patient treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who captured exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data to suggest that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a loss loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , ul@@ cer , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ations ) , ul@@ cer , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , sti@@ cky abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower stomach ) as well as acid vap@@ our .
in patients with stere@@ os@@ ensi@@ tivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , Vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied .
it may not be used in diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ mia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can &apos;t stand tall or sit in at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transpor@@ ting of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following critics are to be followed precisely to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists . • The patients should not go ahead of the first intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts or surgical intervention in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except for P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution must be given ( see Section 4.3 ) .
eco @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ oms , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly this severe and required a hospital reference ) .
the doctor should therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms that point out on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out at the occurrence of men@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain down or so@@ aring pain or new or become lim@@ mer@@ sible So@@ d@@ brennen threatens the drug and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ic side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or , according to symptoms resulting in a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large there are no increased risk associated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , no increased risk has been noted ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ ul@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , commonly related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ ents were predominantly intraven@@ ous , bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to provide the clu@@ es whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ment in patients who require a jaw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is crucial for therapy planning on each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take them when using a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after they have noticed its om@@ is@@ ance .
they are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid and some oral medicines can affect the resi@@ due of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait after the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ tional studies have not been performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is not used either during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equality of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) has been proven in a one @-@ year @-@ multic@@ ultural study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and fac@@ tual evidence on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ tion@@ - study ( FIT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the mid @-@ rises of BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in proportion to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5,@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s group was a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3,@@ 2 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) with the proportion of patients who have suffered one or more typ@@ ec@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed @-@ controlled trials at which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then have been taken 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new vor@@ tices at 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15 % ) .
res@@ ump@@ tion referred to a intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average or@@ ale bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women between 5 and 70 mg for c@@ anned fasting period and two hours before the image of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability rose according to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at one or half an hour was taken in front of a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ar@@ enas , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically important change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in funding in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is distributed after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily in Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ tails , but then quickly spread into the bones or out with urine .

after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the renal Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance is not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is eliminated in rats not via the acid or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not believed to be affected by people &apos;s ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the Gift of radio@@ active cur@@ ated vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy pro@@ ban@@ kers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , amoun@@ ted to 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
traits in patients of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at that is not reloc@@ ated to the bone , quickly out over urine .
although no clinical data has been available about it , it is nonetheless expected that the renal elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the veterin@@ arians also attempt to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased har@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will be expected in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on security , chronic toxicity , for gender toxicity and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential do not allow specific dangers to recognise the human being .

the main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transp@@ l@@ ant was lowered after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , e.g. analysed how often a renewed organization transp@@ l@@ ant or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should perform this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub @-@ or immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of formulation or of the regime should be made only under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced medical person ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in a consequence of a switch to an alternative wording , a therapeutic surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ting and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot;
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ce should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a talent mirror , comparable with both form@@ ulations both at ni@@ er@@ - and le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transp@@ osition period .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ chem@@ a can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has been reached .
if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral intake of medicines may be introduced the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for producing an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca .
duration of the application Z@@ ur suppression of transplan@@ tation must be sustained the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression ; therefore , consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
Dos@@ age recommended - Ni@@ er@@ splan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
additional tin @-@ adap@@ tations can be later required , as the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ology of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ age recommended - Shift from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be res@@ ided by Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this switch in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , to take place .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation after switching from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily need to start treatment with the recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended or@@ ald@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ ade deployment .
cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are committed to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at night once .
other Tran@@ splan@@ chni@@ cal recept@@ ors there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ eling and col@@ o@@ cular patients , came in lung@@ ed patient pro@@ gra@@ f from 0,@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ants at an oral initi@@ ald@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use .
Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special care @-@ care patients with reduced liver function z@@ ur maintenance of blood tal@@ kers in the observ@@ able area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function exercises no influence on the phar@@ yn@@ co@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ ality of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ox@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the talent level in full blu@@ ef@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ting and toler@@ ability in individual cases , by means of full blu@@ ef@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror checks .
it is recommended to conduct frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent levels during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ age customiz@@ ations , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the same time application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whol@@ eg@@ ine concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dosage might require several days until the Ste@@ ady state has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of blood is not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the talent levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are generally in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and at s@@ cur@@ ated patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent occupational therapy of liver , kidney and heart transp@@ l@@ ant , blood con@@ centr@@ ations were normally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or overhead .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of formulation or of the regime should be made only under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation pro@@ vision@@ ing , which has been proven to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapies , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ ade contrac@@ tion at adult heart rate recep@@ tions and Tran@@ splan@@ ade recep@@ tions in childhood are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood pressure can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f , there was a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ y called chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur at Ad@@ vag@@ aries .
other factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ician disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid transfer and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to possible risk of mal@@ ignant skin les@@ ions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , changed consciousness of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , should a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ mut , re@@ tar@@ ded , Lac@@ t@@ osis , is offered in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose in@@ tolerant , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gra@@ absorption particular caution .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah ( z .
Phar@@ mo@@ co@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels primarily consists of the increased or@@ ically bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolic disease .
high @-@ based pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute treatment actions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is imp@@ acted .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormonal exposure , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive actions .
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can prolong their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients does not provide notice that in Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there is an increased risk of unwanted events related to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns on potential impacts of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants often can be found precisely because of the underlying diseases of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

advocacy is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII related , con@@ genital blood cells ) .
the dosage and frequency of application shall be directed to whether Adv@@ ent is applied for the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with mop@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII defect , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Re@@ don@@ ate , similarly , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe until moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cl@@ ots with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
advocacy may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ oleum or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for the marketing of Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ of events , the factor VIII @-@ activity is supposed to sink in the corresponding period of time not under the specified plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel ( in % of the standard or in ( i.e. / d@@ l ) .

injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat before the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment program , for the control of the inj@@ ecting dose and the frequency of injections , an adequate determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ d@@ ash is advised .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII in order to achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .

if the expected factor VIII @-@ plastic activities are not achieved , or if the bleeding with a reasonable dose is not controlled , a test must be performed to em@@ ulate a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be er@@ ased .
the supply speed should be directed after getting the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with mop@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ cular activity of factor VIII @-@ targeted Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .
developing the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 expe@@ ditions are the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .

due to the rare emergence of the mop@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously performed untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .

in case of previously un@@ treated patients of a current clinical trial formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the examination of the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side @-@ effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell , otherwise however , no signs or symptoms occurred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the data available since the first time the CH@@ MP opinion has been assessed as positively , but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
hence the CH@@ MP is on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the filing holder should apply for 5 years to another extension process .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited confirmed the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company assumes its application for approval for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
usually , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body combines , surrounds and supports ) .
these are a type of virus that genetically modified to the body that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that has been changed so it cannot produce copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the canc@@ erous cells to build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the un@@ broken in the human body of existing p@@ 53 gene , is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ erous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , into the bones and the brain .
after CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents the CH@@ MP an day 120 created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors takes advantage of the patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not adequately been proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients currently has to participate in clinical studies or &quot; com@@ @-@ Use programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug @-@ release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled in such a way that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly being released for some hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , by an allergy to pol@@ len @-@ like inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nose @-@ loop ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and young people aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ sli@@ ps ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be investigated on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect measurements were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ ha@@ y fever , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of all hypo@@ cris@@ sc@@ ens@@ ory symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze received , about a decrease of symptoms at 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient who killed pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ sli@@ ce was considered , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in the patients who captured des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side @-@ effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( anti @-@ loss ) , dec@@ aying , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c ingredients or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicinal product to treat allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , ur@@ inary or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension caused by cerebral inf@@ estation ) or have a risk of an ugly stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to approve the marketing of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without breaking them , breaking or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in terms of mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as in the long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can decrease in time .
according to the swelling of the mu@@ d@@ skins in the upper respiratory because the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
because aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients infected with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , black@@ amine , black@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ mel@@ amine , ep@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ iser , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been reviewed for this patient collective , and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been reviewed in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment during occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a tick , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be removed .
in treating the following patients groups are advised to be treated : • Pati@@ o patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension in patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ stick attack in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder infection or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for bon@@ ding actions or reduce their dimensions .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clinical @-@ relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation were observed in addition .
in the results of psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences were detected between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not been identified , so interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ consistency of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ous properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated that in very rare cases it may come to a ben@@ om@@ eness which can cause a impairment of traffic and ability to operate machines .
the symptoms can vary between a C@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , diminished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation ) and a C@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ m@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ ins .

a C@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children , just like dri@@ p in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ness , pl@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ gen@@ dered cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the no@@ or@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement for air performance including the strengthening of subjective th@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to flying .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a cell @-@ arousal .
there were 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nas@@ al grinding ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ons over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the detri@@ mental effects , determined by the nose @-@ sli@@ ces , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
within a single dose @-@ study of the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .

in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the removal of the symptom was a six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to those treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to approve the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole of the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ isti@@ zing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur according to the disease of the disease and may end up after the sound of symptoms and can be resumed in re @-@ occur .
in the pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time .
clinical @-@ relevant interactions have not been established in the context of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the same time the intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities that can lead to impairment or ability to operate machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than with patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly used side effects which was reported more prevalent than with placebo , fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ at@@ eness ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the common side @-@ effect headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients infected with dis @-@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ ly clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ gen@@ dered cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the no@@ or@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple users , which was administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , contained in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ x of the clinical dose ) has been administered for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement for air performance including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isti@@ zing rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively allevi@@ ates the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was acting as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ opath@@ ology regardless of e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine is a primary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria as well as in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first Dos@@ age .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ology study , where patients demo@@ ograph@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ population , was achieved in 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of dis @-@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so interactions with other drugs are not fully excluded

the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years ( see below Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with as@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory tests and skin investigations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experience a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ure ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of as@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is limited to metabolic , is identical to those with children that are normally metabolic .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the same time in@@ gestion of as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not ampli@@ fied the high @-@ quality effect of alcohol ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Sir@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than with patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ grade dosage study by adults and teenagers , at which up to 45 mg of dis @-@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ ly clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .

because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ an in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple users of adults and adolescents , used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ x of the clinical dose ) has been applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .

during a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies have no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults it came about the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol induced power , nor for an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionn@@ aires to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively suggest the by seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first Dos@@ age .
the spread of this restricted metabolism was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l officially distributed the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its approval for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A @-@ virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause a future pan@@ demic .
a pan@@ demic influenza breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus emerges , which can easily spread from person to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is mono@@ cl@@ onal antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form with a contact with a influenza virus of this gene@@ alogy .
subsequently , the membrane blades of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) , cleaned and used as a component of vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this led to the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine , not to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA &apos;s guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the Ac@@ quired Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ du@@ ase is indeed available as a solution for installation , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ du@@ ase should only then be en@@ acted when the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral medication has been taken before , and the likelihood is that the virus will address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice a day 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ gener@@ acy is based upon the body weight .
axi@@ ase reduces in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not to heal , however , can delay the immune system &apos;s immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ du@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , previously had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons .
that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drugs A@@ du@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or change the virus last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , after 48 weeks under A@@ du@@ ase more patients had a virus last under 400 copies / ml than among placebo , yet A@@ du@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ du@@ ase also decreased the virus last but by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , only very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , the viral medication with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drugs A@@ du@@ ase the viral last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer :
in the patients with HIV , that was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , it came under A@@ du@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increased waste of the virus last four weeks than with the patients who took up their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer :
the most common side effects of A@@ du@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and b@@ lower ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ du@@ ase must not be applied in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or any other components .
A@@ du@@ ase may also not be used in patients using cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are produced just like as@@ phy@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for patients , the ap@@ gener@@ acy , the risk of Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card ( dis@@ ruption of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by which reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ du@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ du@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic distor@@ tion of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the utility of A@@ du@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ lob@@ s have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ du@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the approval for scientific reasons were only limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for approval for the transport of gases in the entire European Union .
A@@ du@@ ase is combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ uer@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ atten@@ de@@ fied adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ general are to be administered for phar@@ yn@@ x capsules to pharmac@@ o@@ viol@@ ability along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to setup is 14 % lower than from am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , are generic capsules and solution for setting up a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If there are inc@@ and@@ escent capsules without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ hi@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
Phar@@ mo@@ co@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ du@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons were not investigated in children .
A@@ du@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ du@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ du@@ ase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amp@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ general or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with axi@@ om , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ du@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver b@@ umps with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the specific technical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function , including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be observed according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ du@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ one or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , which weighs over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ p and sup@@ compression of the epi@@ ni@@ ble function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ap@@ gener@@ acy with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis not recommended .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ du@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel from am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ avi@@ r may be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ ial deficiency symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of toxicity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be contra@@ indicated with caution in certain other patients .
A@@ du@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ formerly , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases such as their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer constant anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders , associated .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia patients ( Type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ ters and ha@@ th@@ thro@@ es .
an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual @-@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ tion@@ e@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression , higher Body Mass Index ) , were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of gener@@ a must not be given at the same time using medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ du@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with pharmaceuticals , whose active substances are predominantly transmitted via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and result in a resili@@ ence .
in the attempt , the reduced plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gels through a dosage increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ ber from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal supplement with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking cur@@ rants , the spec@@ kled mirror is and , if possible , to check the viral load and set the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % degra@@ ding when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
clinical trials were used doses of 600 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ sensitivity of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % humili@@ ation when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however it is a tigh@@ ter monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended because of the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ du@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No Dos@@ age adap@@ tion required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine to other proteins and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may sun@@ k .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable since del@@ avi@@ r@@ din due to the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic gels might be less effective .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ du@@ ase is given to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
Phar@@ mo@@ co@@ ine@@ tic studies with axi@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily mg Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole per day once a day with the value that was observed according to 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or , in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can occur if they are applied together with axi@@ ase , potentially cause interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with axi@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as ap@@ gener@@ acy , as it can come to res@@ ti@@ p@@ sis .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ gar drugs known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ spec@@ ca@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ m@@ ash gel by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ block such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , cot@@ odi@@ pin , Nic@@ ot@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , N@@ aran@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase considerably increase its Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ra@@ ging ( 90 % non @-@ commercial interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of map@@ le with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced spot@@ ting of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gels at the simultaneous administration of A@@ du@@ ase .
because Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ c increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ y including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ du@@ ase may not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time being offered by A@@ du@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plas@@ m@@ ash gel of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ial symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the slight gl@@ ass@@ iness of historical comparisons can currently be given no recommendation , such as the spec@@ kled avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adapted when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ants along with A@@ du@@ ase , an increased monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Agency ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predicted , therefore also alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the simultaneous gift of A@@ du@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
this drug should only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of potential use for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated rats were proven amp@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r passes over people into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study at toler@@ able rats , administered by the inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the down@@ time a diminished increase of 12 body weight at night experience .
the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ isation and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the cervi@@ cal animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ du@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ du@@ ase treatment were light to moderate , occurred early in and led rarely to the treatment quarry .
in many of these events , it is not clear if they are applied to HIV treatment , whether they are applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side @-@ effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ F@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ e@@ as@@ former were not subject to patients 1200 mg A@@ du@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which have been standing by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study media , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy has been associated with an re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) with HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and fast @-@ skin tissue , increased intra@@ o@@ inal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hies and dor@@ so@@ fter fat collection ( pins ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally , non @-@ negotiated persons , which were treated with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine on a medium duration of 36 weeks was observed only ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ RT@@ F ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually easy to moderate , inherited or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared generally during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r had to be broken .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in ac@@ utely and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as at peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of spec@@ kled against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ ing of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , were rarely observed with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ en with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant patients . patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically failure were reported in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ former mut@@ ations on :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical res@@ sion @-@ based analysis of otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the assessment of activity of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ lob@@ al @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resi@@ du@@ tion based analyses Klin@@ isch vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ lob@@ al @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed sound@@ proof @-@ Phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a reset tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to amp@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain amount resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance bond between am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ tra@@ ded patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( 3 of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 3 of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in the other way , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former @-@ res@@ ist@@ ente isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to the ins@@ istence .
the early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which may affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ du@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a lower chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with im@@ weigh@@ ted virus sensitivity to au@@ d@@ ase , at least one other P@@ PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ embarrassment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group in relation to the time @-@ adjustable average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ basement wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated A@@ du@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies a general solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI @-@ negotiated patients had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in case of therapy optimization in PI with PI the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; axi@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the middle duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the extent and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ation .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an untreated penetration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ connected am@@ spec@@ kled , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ consistent Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage percentage of the free active component during the dosage is dependent on the overall physician in the Ste@@ ady state , over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines , which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are given if they are given at the same time with fr@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
spec@@ kled is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence are as@@ gener@@ ase solution and ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ grams .
also , the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ plastic materials comparable to those that are obtained from healthy volunteers based on a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ am@@ ity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats played with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne@@ bul@@ b he@@ pat@@ o@@ cular Aden@@ o@@ sts in doses of the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily use of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , Langu@@ ages .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , there were little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings from clinical trials and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genom@@ ic tests , the bacterial test mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mph@@ oma test , were included in human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was not even gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxicity can be observed and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials no significant liver toxicity in patients have been observed , neither during the administration of ap@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , who were treated from a age of 4 days , demonstrated both with the control as well as those treated with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systemic plasma , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage among men , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus pattern and minor skel@@ eton , which refer to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ du@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ hi@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with relap@@ se or mild liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration .
A@@ du@@ ase should be placed in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and result in a resili@@ ence .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % degra@@ ding when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however it is a tigh@@ ter monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ du@@ ase is given to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ block such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , cot@@ odi@@ pin , Nic@@ ot@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ag@@ di@@ pin , N@@ aran@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ra@@ ging ( 90 % non @-@ commercial interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
with the simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ants along with A@@ du@@ ase , an increased monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Agency ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of potential use for the mother compared to the potential risks to the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study at toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the down@@ time a diminished increase in the weight of the reproductive .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ du@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in ac@@ utely and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in the other way , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former @-@ res@@ ist@@ ente isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to the ins@@ istence .
based on these data should be considered to be considered in case of treatment optim@@ isation among PI the benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; axi@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of in@@ consistent Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage percentage of the free active component during the dosage is dependent on the overall physician in the Ste@@ ady state , over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines , which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are given if they are given at the same time with fr@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ am@@ ity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne@@ x he@@ pat@@ o@@ cular Aden@@ o@@ cular aden@@ o@@ ys , which spoke to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily use of 1200 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ zel@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , there were little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings from clinical trials and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro gene detection tests , the bacterial test mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , spec@@ ulators of human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes @-@ content , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was not even gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , who were treated from a age of 4 days , demonstrated both with the control as well as those treated with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results can suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ ites are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ du@@ ase solution to setup is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ lob@@ ster ( PI ) -@@ atten@@ tra@@ ded adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ du@@ ase solution for entry was not taken in case of in@@ filtr@@ ating patients with PI @-@ negotiated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to setup is 14 % lower than from am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , are generic capsules and solution for setting up a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to cease ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , because no can be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ ec@@ ase solution for setting and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patients is to be avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is an application of A@@ du@@ ase solution to take in patient with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ ity is A@@ du@@ ase solution for setting up in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabol@@ ites of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ general or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with axi@@ om , does not prevent the risk of 47 an transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for several medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and warning @-@ color ( under surveillance of the International Standards Agency ) , are available methods of determining the drug concentration .
A@@ du@@ ase should be placed in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia patients ( Type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ ters and ha@@ th@@ thro@@ es .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and result in a resili@@ ence .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % degra@@ ding when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
the simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase considerably increase its Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and lead with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied for the enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neurological manifestations of the condition ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ cul@@ ic@@ ans , g@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and shame .
the following non neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements ag@@ grav@@ ate , l@@ apping , cardi@@ ac and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with in@@ vigor@@ ating equipment , and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by being examined in relation to reducing G@@ ag concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the genes concentrations in their urine are about 60 % , and half of the treated children ended at the end of the study a normal large liver .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( laughter ) , pain pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place .
very frequent side @-@ effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen filling ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ the ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may respond to patients who may respond greatly over @-@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be insp@@ ected every year with all new information that may be known , and will update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regards the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian ) of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is to long @-@ term enzymes for patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries it , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no wick scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and for these patients no wick scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me authorized patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , particularly these patients should continue to be eng@@ masch@@ ige inspections , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment , at the re@@ discovery facility for medical emergency .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment begins .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since little experience in relation to the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ generative ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a light or medium @-@ heavy reaction @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be en@@ visi@@ oned .
in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred to be resumed .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the pre @-@ intensive reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not have a direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data is exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns , who were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to not satisfy the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions in clinical trials were en@@ acted mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years of treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug operations related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been observed during phase 3 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ story , there appeared severe reaction , including bronze , respir@@ ation , and facial oils ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children In@@ er@@ desired drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who have been reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe post@@ ures and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby patients aged 5 years have come to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version mostly within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients no liability by radio@@ immun@@ os@@ en@@ zip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies prior to including 3 patients in which it has never been to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing up to the low level of antibody being a robust reduction of the G@@ ag @-@ level in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ sts had to as@@ certain an variable reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al to low neutral inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug operations , even though the occurrence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ lys@@ ses of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate maintenance of enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and from cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been studied in a random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ eable Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study the total disease spectrum was the majority of the patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 feet .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage amendment to the expected FE@@ V and the absolute pav@@ ement in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ ches .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to see which is shown in the following table .
in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of percentage of percentage . FE@@ V is not significant over this period and the total pneum@@ onia heigh@@ tened increases in proportion to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ ter@@ alie before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined that remained constant down to the degree of study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease , between the patient , which was taken into consideration clin@@ ically significant changes , the clin@@ ically significant changes , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study conducted mainly on the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ genetics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe form of form and 4 with the middle form of form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle form of the form are a normal mental speed of development , whereas in the older patients had been able to determine only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , studies have been conducted on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dosage schem@@ ata at the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schem@@ ata is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to those with older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not been removed yet ( by an operation alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant ) and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant cancer ) has already become slightly spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attacks the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens as single therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should take during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &apos; Anti@@ eme@@ tic &apos; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects appear , the treatment should be up @-@ up , canc@@ eled or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ xed xed therefore the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period in cancer cells .
in the treatment of mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ urn , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had been treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months during the all@@ ot@@ ation of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies patients , however patients with which cancer did not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the compar@@ ational medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each trans@@ lat@@ ch @-@ bottle has to be checked with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine trig@@ gering ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary Do@@ or S@@ IS will be taken from a cum@@ ber @-@ bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % of sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injections ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in excess of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze @-@ based chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin actions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ fraction administration , as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients must also obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ fraction dose as well as after every third type of treatment .
in case of patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , every gift should be created a full blood picture - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ on@@ ism list .
the al@@ kal@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold the upper border value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a Dos@@ age check must take place under the bri@@ dging of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood bil@@ ty or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degrees 2 bleeding .
if patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted if in patients following 2 doses reduction or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological Tox@@ ic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occur or so - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , in comparison with patients aged 65 years , an increased side of side effects is increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data on in@@ sensitivity and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance Clear@@ ance by ≥ 45 ml / min no Dos@@ age adap@@ tations were necessary to go beyond the Dos@@ age adap@@ tations for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients were examined with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ umer@@ ation of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper border value ( for the presence of liver clean@@ ings ) not specifically examined in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone @-@ friendly environment and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients prior to their absolute neut@@ ron &apos;s count once again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ mus @-@ number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute Neut@@ ro@@ lean number , Th@@ ro@@ spinal rate and a maximum @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ der@@ mat@@ ologic toxicity like Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ ised if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients need to be instructed to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction of immune @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous taking of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ fulness T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with whi@@ em@@ et@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended to avoid intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ time limit for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with whi@@ em@@ et@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid composition , accumulation is intended in the trans@@ cellular space to obtain a dra@@ inage of the result before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ fraction treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ or attack , and cerebral vas@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ de@@ fied agents ( except gel fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an irrever@@ sible sk@@ ull of the reproductive @-@ ability due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment regim@@ en to solic@@ it advice on sper@@ ma@@ im@@ itation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 m@@ ash / min ) can lead high doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ logistical ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) , causing a decreased line of effects caused by side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 m@@ b / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ tu@@ t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ fulness T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rec@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ potential as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application has to be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards Agency ) when the decision was made to treat the patient &apos;s ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ ting in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected in a treatment of severe birth defects during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ rec@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if strictly detection and after careful deliber@@ ation of use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

the use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ alized rati@@ os , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , concentr@@ ates the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the norm@@ area .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure adequate vitamins ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers that were at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental studies have no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side @-@ effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ aler and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of sensitive fat is being prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side @-@ effects were obtained from clinical trials by Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not invaluable ) .
the frequency of the known side @-@ effects that were found after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal kin@@ ks can lead .
single tro@@ users of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ grade of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days to norm@@ alized and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ zation , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals can be considered by a quick back @-@ formation system systemic effect , due to the li@@ pas@@ ating properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect works in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pan @-@ pancre@@ atic lights .
clinical trials were derived , that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day which blocks absorption of approximately 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials by adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fatty food .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a share of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the weight loss came up in the first six months .
the average change in the overall cholesterol in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 percent ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
for the wa@@ ist size , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of non @-@ metabolic Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

when you leave a meal or contain a meal no fat , take no capsule . alli can only work when the food contains fat .
if you are taking the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , risk the nour@@ ishment ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to your body to the new eating habits , you start before the first capsule with a cold and fet@@ al diet .
dietary di@@ aries are effective as you can comprehend at any time , what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
in order to secure your target weight , you should set two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Do you reduce fatty acids to reduce the probability of nour@@ ishing esc@@ ope ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • St@@ ay during the intake and also after the intake of alli physically active .

the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and thus arise that more fat from the body is eliminated .
these side @-@ effects tend to occur within the first few weeks after treatment start , as at that time , at that time , the fat share in the diet may have not yet been consistently reduced .
with following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nour@@ ishment commen@@ dations : • Start some days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al du@@ sty diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite dish and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , decreases the likelihood you can cross out your fat limit . • share your recommended fat quantity ev@@ enly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take care of them in the form of a fat primary or a long night &apos;s weight , as you possibly can occur in other programs to weight reduction . • Most people in those using these mat@@ ings , learn to control these with time by adapting their diet .

Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ o@@ therapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as a anti@@ lever ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group , not enough information is available .
this means that the substance will prevent the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapy , the moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting are 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these figures in 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki n Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval for the transpor@@ ting of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : to prevent acute symptoms and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer treatment and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one before chemotherapy given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is able to extend the col@@ on age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection eng@@ masch@@ ig .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
besides in connection with a further chemotherapy agents , alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies hem@@ med Pal@@ on@@ otic tron does not contra@@ dict the activity of the five investigated chemotherapy in the five studied chemotherapy , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical trial , no significant phar@@ mac@@ ular interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ otic tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ induc@@ tors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , Hal@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Hal@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Hal@@ ini@@ ca@@ ine , chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron at human w@@ ren@@ cies are not before , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied at pregnant women unless it is necessary by the treating doctor .
in clinical trials the most common at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with alo@@ xi in relation to headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions to the administration place ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events showed themselves like in the other dosage ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the high distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is not an effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2 c@@ cyclo@@ phosph@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 c@@ cyclo@@ phosph@@ atin , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ otic tron received , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron received that day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etri@@ on .
according to the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron has the ability to block the ion channels in v@@ entri@@ cular and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the duration of action potentials .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was assessing the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in single d@@ osen of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ cription After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ als of the plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow Eli@@ mination from the body with an average season period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally generally in the entire dosage range from 0,@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg with ges@@ tures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase from day 1 and day 5 measured size ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ osis tron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations emerge that once a daily intraven@@ ous form of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg total number ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the submission of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ron@@ es compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ di@@ C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was considered an imm@@ utable drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ in@@ ox , the total body @-@ condition was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver dys@@ functions are the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , however , a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions that are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed the evidence that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can prolong the duration of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which resulted in a daily frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , pitu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , ad@@ renal glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses used and since alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is neg@@ li@@ gible to humans .

the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data before the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , active , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on has been compared with the efficacy of the reference point of 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients responded to 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns voiced that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug will not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on Ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease has more patients back on the reference point of reference ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
aside from this , the test has been evaluated in the study on how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied for the treatment of im@@ peti@@ go ( a combined skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ arus ( R@@ iss@@ - or intersection ) , sc@@ rup@@ tions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which are veri@@ fying or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ res@@ ist@@ ente st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these types of infections may not be affected .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface at 18 years .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial strap ( the parts of the bacteria , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was sub@@ mar@@ cated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin connections Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : when the results of both studies have been collected at home @-@ hours , about 90 % of patients of both groups referred to treatment .
in these two studies however , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( time @-@ filled hollow in the body tissue ) or by infections that have been pro@@ found@@ ly caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation to the order .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ consist@@ encies , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients in which are no improvement within two to three days should be investigated once and to be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local confusion by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be interrupted , the sal@@ be carefully wi@@ pes and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen , or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary in@@ geni@@ ous wound , the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ icillin of st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected passage occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plastic de@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the me@@ ager skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not deemed to be necessary when topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity after oral in@@ gestion and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the Federal Republic of Germany ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated , between the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that apply Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation during the administration , which is approximately 1 % of the patients .
effect of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , which is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ ery ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the drug mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial prot@@ ec@@ tion@@ thesis by inter@@ acting on a specific bond of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bond rating of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ centre .
by attachment in this bond , ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ itter , blocking partial P @-@ bonds inter@@ interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
should the local prevalence of resistance to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear with at least some infection forms , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to methane .
in the case of a non @-@ reference to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
met@@ or@@ ation In a study with healthy adult was taken 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and ported skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plastics were obtained .
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and for the children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

Ambi@@ rix is applied for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of the existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine may be led out of two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is requested for Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis A@@ - or B @-@ B vaccine .
vaccines have effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can f@@ end up against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adult and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix Children agreed within three doses of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients , some of the data included the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody therapeu@@ tics one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the final injection of antibody therapeu@@ tics against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of peti@@ tions , pain in the inj@@ ecting location , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may respond to patients who may have hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) , not being used .
August 2002 , the European Commission informed the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. an approval for the transport of Ambi@@ rix all over the world
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines or with a combin@@ ant pul@@ p can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ Cs ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis type ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed up , whether immun@@ o @-@ competent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination may require a refres@@ her pattern as protection , as it may be protected by immun@@ ological memory due to immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the use of the vaccine , appropriate options for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the Com@@ bin@@ ational simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ ulating viral hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in case of in@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under circumstances there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody that may be required in these cases the gift of further vaccines .
because an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration might lead to a subtle impact success , these injections should be avoided .
in case of thy@@ ro@@ spinal fluid or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Job ) or with a combined mas@@ king m@@ umps V@@ ine vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , that may not be made sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , matri@@ ces , Gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency associated with the former Thi@@ ere and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and skill on a comp@@ utation per vaccination dose , but not on a comp@@ utation per person .
pain was observed according to the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the test after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den that received Ambi@@ rix had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % at the test subjects , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age com@@ b .
however , the frequency of mats was similar high ( i.e. over the entire vaccine @-@ cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den that received Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the test that received the 3 @-@ doses com@@ plac@@ ements ) .
the frequency of the pain and mould was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the composite simp@@ y with the 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general arrangements in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which is observed with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ation@@ material with 360 ELISA units form@@ ulating viral hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
however , at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix was a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ tape , reports .
the share of vaccines that schem@@ atic over heavy side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination program with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ ulating viral hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was not different statisti@@ cally .
in clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses were Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ation@@ material with three doses .
for the 2@@ 89 people whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was ex@@ hal@@ ted , the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ chni@@ cal rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the table 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ doses .
the immun@@ o@@ response that were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with ambient or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ ulating viral hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ mers aged between 12 and 15 years , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies have been detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation associated with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
the investig@@ ational immun@@ o@@ response against both anti@@ gens in this study was comparable to that , after vaccination of 3 doses with a compound simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activ@@ ating Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a tin volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be compared to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme , which is in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine scheme .
if the first dose is ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time with a refres@@ her di@@ ph@@ onic , t@@ ant@@ aneous and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les vaccine administered ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ chni@@ cs and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions such as the former formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ al code to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the Hepatitis A @-@ virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in the waters of waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect fully before an infection with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , although the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines that are infected with hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick , ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those according to a viral hepatitis or hepatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has been an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can vary through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin strikes , breathing difficulty or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B in your child . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you with your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A@@ - / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccination ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered for one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , suffer from the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened with a disease or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own department , or if you / your child undergo a ho@@ of @-@ modi@@ fying / under@@ mine .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response to those individuals on the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is responding to the vaccine .
21 strings you take your doctor if you / your child may take other medicines / incorporate ( including those who have been received without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / or has been given or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has it planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix not administered pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is necessary that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have once again shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
very often ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the sti@@ cking site or redness • moderation • head@@ ache • headaches • appetite deficiency
often ( up to 1 case per 10 consecutive doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single components against hepatitis A and hepatitis B is very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 p@@ im@@ ated doses ) are :
these include limited limited or expan@@ sions , the ju@@ cks can be or blo@@ om @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyel@@ ids and the face , sn@@ ap@@ ti@@ zing breathing or gor@@ ges , sudden blood pressure and awareness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for transpor@@ ts , the CH@@ MP opinion considers that the benefit risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought to traffic in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete endo@@ cr@@ acy , or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ tic encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ary con@@ formity ) in pre @-@ history .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed with all patients in which a complete endo@@ cr@@ ine deficiency occurs already in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a bel@@ t@@ mani@@ firm form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life of life ) , then there is an indication of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial encephal@@ opathy consists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ op@@ tic disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein intolerance and for the growth and development necessary daily prot@@ ein@@ ation of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an earliest a shortage of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ c@@ app@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered in patients with lo@@ op@@ tic disorders , as a risk for the emergence of oils op@@ hag@@ us consists if the tablets do not enter into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and estrogen .
because metabolic isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate occurs via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure should be applied only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and to a heigh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cervi@@ cal syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old baby @-@ child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go out with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in a intraven@@ ous form of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection , carried out by acet@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is left out over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore regarded as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , dil@@ uted sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine can be produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival @-@ chances and clinical results .
pre@@ diction of the earliest shape of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always inf@@ ect@@ ist , and the disease itself resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its sti@@ tial an@@ alogy within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium and sodium poly@@ acet@@ ate ) , proteins , sodium and possibly sub@@ stitutes by essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of newly @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) , diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac in the form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ est trans@@ car@@ b@@ bam@@ ase deficiency ) that were reco@@ vering from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ter@@ ic encephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ested diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may result in further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ stru@@ ed in liver and kidneys , with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined by using a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl at so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary Cycle , the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ ular Pres@@ ent and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined by cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous form of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plastic de@@ centr@@ ates were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ra @-@ cy@@ c@@ lical or hem@@ ost@@ opath@@ ies , after varying doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three individual cases ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate conc@@ entri@@ c seals on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the counter @-@ ju@@ g product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( inquiry 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children that do not yet swal@@ low tablets , or patients with eggs ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also or a nose .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an earliest a shortage of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ ric of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ ses .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl ph@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plastic de@@ centr@@ ates were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the durability the patient can preserve the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the drug over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use also in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ prop@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes such that they accumulate the sti@@ tial waste products that can accumulate after consuming proteins in the body .
if conducted with you laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could move into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , flavors , indul@@ gence of hearing , dis@@ orient@@ ate , remin@@ ders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states have been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or with the intake of your hospital in order to establish a corresponding treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

30 If in your laboratory studies are made , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS distributed to same sensitive oral or over a stomach f@@ ist@@ les ( hose that runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose son@@ de ( hose which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • remove from the container a bo@@ iling measur@@ er of gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife on the edge of the Mess@@ l@@ ley to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Find the recommended number of measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary cells ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ( cardi@@ ac infection ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ al@@ ination of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients which undergo from a PC@@ I , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or coron@@ ary heart in maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PC@@ I .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS and in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ a II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug to prevent blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ) with conventional composite treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PC@@ I the patient often was a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a sh@@ utter ) and they also received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ology or vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who subjected themselves to a PC@@ I , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ et@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other shepherd , or any of the other components .
it should also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PC@@ I was an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( instinc@@ ts Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ ancy ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency attack or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ ald@@ from An@@ gi@@ ox in Pati@@ ents with ACS is a intraven@@ ous shaft of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt should be increased from 0,5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PC@@ I , according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PC@@ I consists of an initi@@ als of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and is one of the subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion using a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PC@@ I intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt should be carried out from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
to be able to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney kidney cancer ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PC@@ I ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower inflation rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose is to be administered from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and re@@ viewing the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in case of patients with moderate kidney injury , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes of gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after the c@@ ess@@ ation of un@@ questionable he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low molecular si@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or other components , or against bra@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood stress . • severe un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able hyper@@ tension and / or irrever@@ sible hyper@@ tension . • severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are treated carefully during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if with PC@@ I @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most bleeding may occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , in patients who occur to a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary force ( PC@@ I ) during the treatment in principle everywhere up bleeding .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , the monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards Agency ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will be restored prior to the treatment of existing levels .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sch@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood of blood .
in case of a combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thy@@ self @-@ aggreg@@ ation@@ ers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ants , the clinical and biological skins parameters are regularly updated in each case .
the animal experimental studies are inadequate in regards to the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the disclosure or post@@ nat@@ al development inadequate ( see below Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable bra@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in those treated with He@@ par@@ in treated compar@@ atively groups in women and patients over 65 years were more common to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and T@@ IM@@ I standards for heavy bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding played by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ prints plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular blood , in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular blood bleeding , hem@@ at@@ ula , hem@@ i@@ cular blood levels , decreased by ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood test , re@@ surgery due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ ot@@ al , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6,000 patients , which undergo from a PC@@ I .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in those treated with He@@ par@@ in treated compar@@ atively groups in women and patients over 65 years were more common to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding played significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ atively group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are sorted according to system organ@@ classes ordered in table 6 .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will immediately break off and the patient eng@@ masch@@ ige in terms of signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ pump , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic Centre and the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ Bind@@ ing region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , independently of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is tied in liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is spl@@ its up by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .

if the patient was conducted in the patients following a PC@@ I , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be increased and the in@@ fusion should be increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questionable he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin insulin is very slightly different from human rights , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter activity as a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was evaluated in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin is established .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal standard .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to approve the marketing of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is considered to be sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ usion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the decreased glucose @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ esis and the diminished insulin delivery of insulin , insulin can be desc@@ ends in patients with a restriction of liver disease .
any change in effect , the brand ( adolescents ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin delivery .
3 An insufficient dosage or canc@@ el@@ ation of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ aged diabetes , may cause hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and may make a change in the dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at changing the treatment regim@@ en .
among the substances that can increase the blood sugar @-@ sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting , fibro@@ us , flu@@ ox@@ etine , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ants , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yl@@ hen , s@@ ali@@ cy@@ l@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ lo@@ osen , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ renal col@@ oration may be or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ eness in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ milk enters into human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral use .
below are the clinical trials listed out of clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system classes and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the ba@@ it data cannot be invaluable ) .

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy is missed , the inj@@ ecting location within the injection range can be changed continuously , can result in the result of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic with consci@@ ous@@ y can be treated by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to detect the general cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous fork in the efficiency of insulin , insulin delivery is done faster and the duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em .
in a study involving 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years of type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ application has been demonstrated by 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dose of dis@@ proportionate glucose levels , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose levels , just like human .
insulin is@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as rapid efficiency as normal human beings and achie@@ ves the complete draft resolution about 2 hours earlier than human .
the data was visi@@ bly seen that at an application of insulin disease in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ ur@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ dian control is reached as with human normal age that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin is practi@@ sed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ nat@@ al control was achieved as with human normal age , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is wasted in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as at human standard , the 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des are given prior to the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in Gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal age , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal standard , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
