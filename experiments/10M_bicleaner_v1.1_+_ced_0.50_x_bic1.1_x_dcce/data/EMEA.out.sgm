<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Progress Report (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the Packungsbeaks (also component of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 15 mg, and 30 mg enamelled tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to setup (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used for treating moderate to severe severe episodes and the prevention of dietary episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied or the melting pot in patients may be applied to which the abstaining of tablets difficulties are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are just like" "" "bilify" "", "the dose of bilify should be adjusted." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent acts as the neurotransmitters to enable the receptors to activate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents her reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of bilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which compared to increased unrest during a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Halebidol, in a different study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been re-perform at 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of bilify injections was evaluated in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that were placed on heightened unrest, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melting pot and the solution to take resorbed (absorbed).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies conducted with the injection solution patients, the Abilify in cans of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-time studies were more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), extrapolation, Treatolenz), sedation (sleeptic), sedation (bration), saliva hypersecretion (increased saliva production), tiredness and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of bilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes relate to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee agreed that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the transportations of bilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or coma therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients should be considered a lower initialddose when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is discharged from the combinant therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of supra mental behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or switching of an antipsychotic therapy, even if treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, no increased risk of addiction to Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease (myocardium), cerebral vascular diseases, conditions that apply for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloodpressurizing medicines) or hypertension (including parceltic and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, which were a year or less digested, there were occasional reports of during the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskid arthritis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be applied in patients with kramper in the anamnese or on states that are linked with crampons in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a raised mortality rate compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undeserrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoaciosis or hyperosmolarcoma or death, was reported in patients infected with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related undesirable events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-related patients to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotic entities, in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripigezol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with itself overlay side effects such as sedation. (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist is Famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the residution rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered to be clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, an extremely effective CYP2D6-inhibitor (Chinidine) has remained the AUC by Aripiprazl about 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metals.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider using a common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protectors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage from ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage height before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 will be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the arithmeval concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials reported doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day does not have any significant effect on the Metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology morphan / 3-methodology morphinan-ratio), 2C19 (Warcolorin), 2C19 (Dextromethylan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal safety studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, with other antipsychotic medication, patients should be warned about to be warned dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are safe that Aripiprazole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) on than placebo or were deemed as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients infected with Aripianism, a total reduced incidence (25,8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acrylic, Dystony and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with Halilidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15,1% in patients under olanation therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazolkin treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperated idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term experience of more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazolkin treatment and 15,7% for those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of the CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side-effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch have been unintentional or intentional transdoings with Aripiprazl alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a heron sis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; it is unlikely that hematalysis is due to the treatment of overdose of benefits, since Aripiprazole has a high plastic use.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole at schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors will mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and Serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT2-, to alpha-1-adrengen and to the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With gift of Aripiprazole in doses of 0,5-30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dose-dependent reduction of the loyalty of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus caudatus and by the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Halated idol controlled trial was 52 the share of Responsible patients who attended a reference to the study media, in both groups similar (Aripiprazol 77% and Halcodol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from the scales, which were defined as secondary education, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Strike-scale, showed a significant stronger improvement than in Halcodol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks at stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of residual rates, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an OlanZapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study conducted with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients performed under Aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the most valuable patients) compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazl a compared to placebo-leased effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placebo- and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed an effect compared with placebo or half-operating effects that was comparable to that of lithium or Halcodol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also referred to 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania, such as lithium or Halcodol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks do not affect Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy in therapeutic serum, revealed the escort therapy with Aripiprazole a superior effectiveness in reducing malicious symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, which had reached a remission ahead with Aripiprazole compared to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in preventing a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxycysis of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkydy is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbwerage is nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive Metabolisians over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharyntics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacoinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A special-specific evaluation of Pharmocoinetik revealed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharyncoartics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacotic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on impairment of liver disease on Pharpiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security analysis, toxicity in repeatable gift, reproduction, toxicity, and canogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers to recognise the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects are only observed in doses or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a dose-dependent secondary-pigment (AUC) at rats for 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 60 mg / kg / carcinoma) at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10ly of the middle Steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholelithiasis has been established as a result of the decolonisation of sulphur conjugate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3fold the middle Steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the results found in human genetics at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations that have been found in the study of 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far under the marginal values (6%) of the vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed according to dosages, which resulted in expositions of the 3- and 11times of the middle Steady state of AUC at the recommended clinical Maximaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and there was no collateral connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules which promotes the contraction of microtubules from the Tubular Inmeren and stabilize the microtubules by inhibiting their deolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization results in a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulary network, which is essential for the vitational interphase and the cootic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well-known that it conveys the transzytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and has been demonstrated within-vitro studies that the presence of Albayaxel enhances the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenitheliale transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Album-counter and due to the albuminator Proteins (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of abrasion for metastatic mammacarcinoma is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single-armed studies and by 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparison study.</seg>

<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after the abrasion-administration higher (43%) than after a solvent-sized Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at myxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro-studies of human liver microsome and tissue, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abrasion in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma, the average total dose of 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renale Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="573">During the first study, nearly eight 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis, and it was examined the number of typhoons and hip fractures over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, which recently suffered a fracture; it was examined the number of fractures over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Risedronat (a different bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indication for the effectiveness was whether the salary of the alkaline phosphorase in the Serum (a enzyme which builds up the bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (excluding other osteoporosis medicines) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70%.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 from 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repetitive infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitively (allergic) against Zoledronic, or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients in Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney cancer, reactions to the infusion point and osteonecrose (dying of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material for doctors that entails Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, the clues of how the medicine is applied, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="615">In the study for the prevention of clinical fractures, after a recently reduced hip, the vitamin D mirror were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a great clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion place, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reports (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosen in the oral area was occasionally used, especially in cancer patients, about osteonekrosen (primarily in the oral area), which were treated with bisphosphate, including customs cleic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extraction, or other dental attacks.</seg>

<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer-tomographic - (µCT) analysis showed it to be treated with Aclasta patients compared to placebo for increasing bone loss and maintaining the traditional bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkalatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptid des Type-I- Kolcollagen (P1NP) in the Serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTX) in the Serum were determined in sub-assemblies from 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5-mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months substantially increased by 30% compared to the output value and was held at 28% below the output of up to 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT-study raised the AclaTA treatment compared to the placebo treatment the BMD on the pollinens and Schenkelp.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Accountant treatment carried out over 24 months in comparison to the placebo treatment to an increase in the BMD by 5.4% on the total table and by 4.3% on the thigraph.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT-study were randomised to 508 men and with 185 patients were judged the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to indicate a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% to Aclasta's treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta in comparison with once weekly administration of Alendronat referred to the percentage modification of the Lendenwirt-BMD after 24 months in comparison with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined for patients aged over 30 years, especially light up to moderate morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphate gases according to 2.6times up to 3,0,000-specific upper levels of inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic, compared to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronat once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain strength and pain modification, compared to the output value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were specified at the end of six month's main study as Responsible (on the therapy) could be recorded in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronat patients participating in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response could be maintained during 141 of the patients with Aclasta, compared to 71 the patients with Risedronat treated patients, in the middle duration of the aftermath of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multi-value 5 and 15 minutes lasting incisions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of customs cleic acid in 64 patients treated the following pharmacocular data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasmaspiegel took off quickly at &lt; 10% of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast-paced biological vanishing from the large cycle with half-times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½% 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminalen eliminationary time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of the phases (α and β with the above ½ values) probably represent the rapid resolution into the bones and excretion about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains untreated by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance-concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmakonzentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of Cytochrom-P450-Enzymsystems metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not yet metabolized at humans, and because it is a waxy or even no direct and / or irreversible, subtle Inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renale Clearance of Zoledronic acid, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (area 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">From this, a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive kidney dysfunctions up to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the customs-acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney dysfunctions (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous single dose amounted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs were detached from 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal disease.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7triple of the human therapeutic exposure, related to AUC, corresponds), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated applications with encumulative expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended Human-exposure sufficiently, the toxicological effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Progress Report (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (in particular overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) can not be applied. • It can be applied together with another Diabetesdrug (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied with metformin only in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnace or insulin, the current dose of sulphylharnosis or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); it should be reduced to the dose of sulphylharnymous and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar level is sinking, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of accounts in Tripletherapy has been studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylharnar, in addition they received either accounts or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycoslized hemostin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Accounts led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels at the application of the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of accounts on existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharningredient in a reduction of HbA1c values around 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study conducted in which the combination of accounts and insulin is examined at 289 patients, patients receiving accounts in addition to insulin, a reduction of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% compared to the patient which additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects associated with Actos were visual defects, infections of the upper respiratory tract (cold cuts), weight gain and hypothesia (diminished sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts may not be used in patients who may have to be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketonism - seagrogel - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for authorisation for marketing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also displayed for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose bloodsugar is inadequate and incompatibility with which metformers is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">Applying Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients infected by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician ought to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>

<seg id="771">In case of patients with increased output liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper boundary of normalization) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases up to the 3-times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes will be re-controlled as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point out on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, colonel, fatigue, appetite, and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes to review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be continued until the provision of the Laboratory parameters are led by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fat deposits, and in some cases associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hermodities, the therapy with pioglitazon (relative reduction of 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemotherapy and insulin (relative reduction of hemmoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity there is patients who have pioglitazon as oral or triple therapy with a sulphylharnosis or as a branch therapy with insulin, the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, under the treatment with Thiazolian indions, including pioglitazon, reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular degeneration with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular dems, if patients report about interference of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="783">In the pro-active study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures from 44 / 805 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is replicated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharynchronologic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digesoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon which diminished hyperinsulinmia and increased insulin resistance resistance and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (made of this data invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the brakes indexes of the lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT-Anrises above the triple of the normals of the normals, however, often referred to as under placebo but less than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylharnoses.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency increased by 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazon or on the basis of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, if pioglitazon was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of messages imdesirable events regarding bone brotheres from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated in those treated with pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated in patients with comparatively medically examined groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In over a period of 3.5 years ongoing trial, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance increases.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to examine the time until retrofitting of the therapeutic effects (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy started a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeable study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate in spite of a three-month optimization phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the average HbA1c - worth 0.45%, compared to the patient, which continued to be only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pioglitazon group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the album in / creatinin-quotas compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited examination of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-glycemeride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as insignificant, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide contains the total plastic matrix glycemeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo under Pioglitazone no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels was found while under metformin and Gliclacide values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazon was not only the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the posturdial triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the triglyptic absorption as well as to the hepatic Triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease, were randomised over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the highest concentration on unchanging Pioglitazone in plasma is usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV does not correspond to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In response studies could be proven that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on Pharmocoinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digesoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Indus) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactive market picoglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in the resn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and all of the active Metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmaglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the parent is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys matches after repeated appointments with inmodial, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulinmia and increased insulin resistance resistance and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (at male and female rats) and tumors (at male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial omatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colonosors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the pro-active study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures from 44 / 805 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of metric therapy of metformin each study were examined in each case with pioglitazon or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the album in / creatinin-quotas compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazon is not only the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postnatdial triglyceride levels, this has an effect on Tryglycemerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target regarding its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total colonisation, non-deadly myocardium, cerebral vascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, suggest the results close that using Pioglitazone are not associated with cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages imdesirable events regarding bone brokers from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with pioglitazone, showed a increased incidence of bone mutation in women.</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study, at which 1 072 patients participated, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) compared to a placebo (hypomedicaments) and by Allopurinol (a different medicinal product for the treatment of hyperurikemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study two doses of adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each year with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, Allopurinol was applied at a dose of once daily by 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose urinary armour in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the blood of the last three measurements.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of the patient, the adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg recorded daily, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patients, which took once daily 120 mg, in the last three measurements a urinary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and in any of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (nauseas), skin rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart defects in the pre-history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that adenuric was more effective in reducing the urinary tract in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperurikemia in diseases that have already led to Uratablagings (including one from the medical history known or currently available in Gichtal and / or a gilarthritis).</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During the clinical trials of phase 3, light abnormalities of the liver function were observed with Febuxostat treated patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function before the beginning of Febuxostature and in the course of course, depending on clinical assessments (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline was conducted no exchange studies to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-Hemp can lead to a rise of theophylline-table (a shirt of the metastorization of Theophyllin was also reported for other XO-Hemmer).</seg>

<seg id="1216">The reduction of the serum belts to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor's visit in week 2 and maintained permanently on the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cancers &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function limiting the APEX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functioning (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy point has been reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There was no clinically significant differences with regard to percentage of serum-acid concentration at Probanden, irrespective of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary end-point in the subgroup of patients with serum harnacid Concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40% of the patients (Baseline) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum saws at &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) caused a decrease of the incidence of patients in the months 16-24 a treatment against a gypsy type (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gypsum).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of plotal code, resulting in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the poison node to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open-long term studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure to Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplantation or increased incidence of side-effects, including sub-or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of formulation or of the regime should be made only under the tighter control of an experienced medical person (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a switch to an alternative wording, a therapeutic surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulting and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations"</seg>

<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the talent level in full blueft The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of repulting and tolerability in individual cases, by means of full blueft-Tacrolimus-Talmirror checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct frequent controls of the Tacrolimus talent levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also change from Prograf on Advagraf, Dosage customizations, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus wholegine concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dosage might require several days until the Steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of blood is not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the talent levels of Tacrolimus are generally in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at scurated patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent occupational therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant, blood concentrations were normally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including transplants or other side-effects which can occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus under- or overhead.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of formulation or of the regime should be made only under the tighter control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood pressure can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under prograf, there was a cardiomyopathy called chamber or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur at Advagaries.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinician disorders, are an already existing cardiac disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid transfer and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the effect of sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to possible risk of malignant skin lesions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited confirmed the committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) officially that the company assumes its application for approval for the marketing of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breasts, the brain, the bones or the pasture parts (tissues, the other structures in the body combines, surrounds and supports).</seg>
<seg id="1642">These are a type of virus that genetically modified to the body that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "that has been changed so it cannot produce copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancerous cells to build the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the unbroken in the human body of existing p53 gene, is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can't be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient at the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the area of the subtree, into the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents the CHMP an day 120 created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors takes advantage of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not adequately been proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients currently has to participate in clinical studies or "com@-@ Use programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed drug-release" means that the tablets are assembled in such a way that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly being released for some hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, by an allergy to pollen-like inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nose-loop (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and young people aged 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-slips (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be investigated on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect measurements were the changes in the severity of the hahay fever, which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all hypocrisscensory symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported that aerinaze received, about a decrease of symptoms at 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patient who killed pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-slice was considered, patients under Aerinaze showed a alleviation of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26,7% in the patients who captured desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side-effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachycardia, oral, psychomotor hyperactivity (anti-loss), decaying, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnia, insomnia, insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic ingredients or loratadine (a different medicinal product to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (hypertension), urinary or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension caused by cerebral infestation) or have a risk of an ugly stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe to approve the marketing of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without breaking them, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in terms of misconception and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as in the long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">According to the swelling of the mudskins in the upper respiratory because the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients infected with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine such as Bromocripitin, pergolid, blackamine, blackamine, Dihydromelamine, epylephrine, epheiser, Oxymetacolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been reviewed for this patient collective, and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of the aerinaze have not been reviewed in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment during occurrence of hypertension or a tick, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treating the following patients groups are advised to be treated: • Patio patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension in patients with a myokardstick attack in anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder infection or bronchospasmus in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze has at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for bonding actions or reduce their dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinical-relevant interactions or changes in the Plasmakonzentration were observed in addition.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of psychomotor tests, no significant differences were detected between the patients with desloratadine and those treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadine is taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme of desloratadin responsible enzyme has not been identified, so interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-Glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconsistency of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrious properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should however be elucidated that in very rare cases it may come to a benomeness which can cause a impairment of traffic and ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulation) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with potential letins.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, complicated muslition, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory, nausea, vomiting, nausea, nausea, vomiting, predialing, tenities and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, just like drip in-typical symptoms (mouthness, plupillenrigidity and - dilatation, bonding, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the imitation of the release of progendered cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / Basophiles, as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the noorsionsmolecules P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement for air performance including the strengthening of subjective thepiness or the tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a cell-arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal-allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined based on the overall cores for the symptom (except nasal grinding), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrons over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the detrimental effects, determined by the nose-slices, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of the aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose-study of the pharynchroninetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the peroralen application of Aerinaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days, the equaling-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudo-hedrons were reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacotic multi-disciplinary study study, which has been conducted with the formulation as tablet by healthy adult probanden, has been found that four test deloratadine poorly prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A Components study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrons, according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrons, was assigned to the gift of a aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security analysis, toxicity in repeatable gift, toxicity and reproduction oxicity make the preclinical data with desloratadine, however, do not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects generally stood in connection with the ingredient pseudoephedrons.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducing stoxial studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was in the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than with patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly used side effects which was reported more prevalent than with placebo, fatigue (1,2%), mouthateness (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the common side-effect headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients infected with dis-loratadine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multidisciplinary study, where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nly clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the imitation of the release of progendered cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / Basophiles, as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the noorsionsmolecules P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple users, which was administered in the desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, contained in the desloratadine in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nex of the clinical dose) has been administered for ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">During a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement for air performance including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistizing rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistence allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhino-contivitis, Aerius effectively alleviates the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was acting as a substitute for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathopathology regardless of etiology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is a primary factor in all urticular disorders, it is expected that desloratadine is in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria as well as in other forms of urticaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving preuritus and the reduction of size and number of quaddles at the end of the first Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronic idiopathic urticaria was the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistaminika, excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching of more than 50% was observed at 55% of those treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with aserius reduced the disorder of sleep and wax, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharynchronology study, where patients demoographs were comparable with the general seasonal-allergic rhinitis -population, was achieved in 4% of the patients a higher concentration of dis-loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clue to a clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme of desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so interactions with other drugs are not fully excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-Glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) do not affect the availability of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials provided with desloratadine and Loratadin performed preclinical studies, at a comparative degree of exposure to desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity of desloratadine and by loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety promacology, toxicity in repeatable gift, genders and manufacturing oxicity make the preclinical data with disloratadine do not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aserius can be taken independent of meals, to alleviate the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and peristizing allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see below Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by children under 2 years (see below Section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with aserius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies should play a role in diagnosis the anamnese, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory tests and skin investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise disloratadin limited and experience a higher substanzure (see below Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of aserius Sirup with children between 2 and 11 years of age, which is limited to metabolic, is identical to those with children that are normally metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains Saccharose and Sorbitol; therefore patients should not take with hereditary problems of fructose intolerant, glucose-gactose-absorption or a sacrase inhibitor insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Soundically relevant interactions have not been established in the context of clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see below Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, at the same time ingestion of aserius tablets and alcohol has not amplified the high-quality effect of alcohol (see below Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Sirus Sirup group like the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than with patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-grade dosage study by adults and teenagers, at which up to 45 mg of dis-loratadine (nly clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged 1 to 11 years old, used for histamine therapy in question, received a daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin adults can be extrapolian in adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple users of adults and adolescents, used in the desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, used in the desloratadine in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nex of the clinical dose) has been applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>

<seg id="1779">During a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies have no impairment of psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinically-pharmacological studies of adults it came about the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a reinforcement of alcohol induced power, nor for an increase in the sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving the symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionnaires to the quality of life at Rhino-contivitis, Aerius tablets effectively suggest the by seasonal-allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving preuritus and the reduction of size and number of quaddles at the end of the first Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolism was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacocular parameters were observed in a pharmacotic multi-quality study with the syupid of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are limited, observed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) through desloratadine was about 6times higher than 6times higher and the Cmax approximate about 3 to 4times higher with a time limit of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no evidence for a clinically relevant active ingredient in Kumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and young people.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In different individual dose studies revealed that AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable to those of adults, the desloratadine syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l officially distributed the Committee for Humantherapeutic agents (CHMP) officially that the company takes its approval for approval for the transport of Aflunov to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect flu, caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A-virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic influenza breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus emerges, which can easily spread from person to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine" "" "physical foreign" "" "and is monoclonal antibodies." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form with a contact with a influenza virus of this genealogy.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane blades of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as body alien), cleaned and used as a component of vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">This led to the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine, not to meet the requirements of the EMEA's guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Aduase is indeed available as a solution for installation, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aduase should only then be enacted when the doctor has checked the antiviral medication has been taken before, and the likelihood is that the virus will address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken along with twice a day 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of apgeneracy is based upon the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Axiase reduces in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to heal, however, can delay the immune system's immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Aduase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, previously had not been treated with proteasons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">That with low dosified Ritonavir increased drugs Aduase was compared with 206 adults, who had previously taken proteasformer, with other proteassigns.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (virus last) or change the virus last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no proteasformer, after 48 weeks under Aduase more patients had a virus last under 400 copies / ml than among placebo, yet Aduase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Aduase also decreased the virus last but by the children who had previously been treated with proteasons, only very few in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasons, the viral medication with Ritonavir increased drugs Aduase the viral last after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasehemmer:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, that was resistant to four other proteasons, it came under Aduase together with Ritonavir to increased waste of the virus last four weeks than with the patients who took up their previous proteasehemmer:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Aduase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and blower (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Aduase must not be applied in patients which may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amspecavir or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aduase may also not be used in patients using currants (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are produced just like asphyase and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for patients, the apgeneracy, the risk of Lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonekcard (disruption of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of infection caused by which recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Aduase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Aduase is usually taken along with the pharmacoinetic distortion of Ritonavir, but the committee determined that the utility of Aduase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had no proteaslobs have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Aduase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because the approval for scientific reasons were only limited." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited for approval for the transport of gases in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aduase is combined with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, proteasuermer (PI) -attendefied adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Ageneral are to be administered for pharynx capsules to pharmacoviolability along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amspecavir should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amspecavir as a solution to setup is 14% lower than from amspecavir as a capsule; therefore, are generic capsules and solution for setting up a milligram per milligram basis not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for apgenerase capsules is 600 mg of ampavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If there are incandescent capsules without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to Ahiase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for apgenerase capsules is 20 mg of amoavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg ampavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmocoinetics, efficacy and safety of Aduase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasons were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aduase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data on inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacotic data, the dose to Aduase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aduase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing currants (hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasmakonzentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ampavir during the intake of amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Ageneral or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with axiom, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Aduase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral therapy therapy, have an increased risk of severe liver bumps with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the specific technical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing limited liver function, including a chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under a antiretroviral therapy and should be observed according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Aduase and Ritonavir with fluticulone or other Glukokorticosteroids, which weighs over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids, including Morbus Cusp and supcompression of the epinible function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and simvastatin strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of apgeneracy with Lovastatin and simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Agency), are available methods of determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Aduase can be less effective because of decreased plasmaspiegel from amspecavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampavir may be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored at opial deficiency symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be contraindicated with caution in certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aduase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms. (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasformerly, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an excitation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases such as their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug addicts factors, such as a longer constant antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders, associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In haemophilia patients (Type A and B), who were treated with proteasons, reports about an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous cutters and haththroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">An inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual-viral therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactortionetiology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of genera must not be given at the same time using medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Aduase with Ritonavir must not be given together with pharmaceuticals, whose active substances are predominantly transmitted via CYP2D6 and are linked to the increased plasmaspiegel with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin is caused by an 82% reduction in AUC by Amspecavir which can lead to a virological failure and result in a resilience.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt, the reduced plasmaspiegels through a dosage increase of other protein inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently observed undesirable effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Currant (hypericum perforatum) The Serumber from Amspecavir can be degraded by the simultaneous use of herbal supplement with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking currants, the speckled mirror is and, if possible, to check the viral load and set the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with amspecavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax at 30% degrading when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amspecavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Clinical trials were used doses of 600 mg of ampavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and insensitivity of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliation when Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Loponavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of amspecavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however it is a tighter monitoring, as the effectiveness and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacotic study conducted in combination with Didanosine, but is recommended because of the antasia component of Didanosin, that the revenues of Didanosine and Aduase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination of Efavirenz in combination with amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) No Dosage adaption required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amspecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasehemmer would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine to other proteins and existing limited data suggests that nevirapinto the Serumkonzentration of Amspecavir may sunk.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable since delavirdin due to the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plastic gels might be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough prediction of the effect of combination of amspecavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amspecavir and rifabutin resulted in a increase in Plasmakonzentration (AUC) of Rifabutin at 193% and thus an increase in associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin along with Aduase is given to a reduction in dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmocoinetic studies with axiase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasmaspiegel of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily mg Fosamoavir and 100 mg of Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole per day once a day with the value that was observed according to 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fosamspecavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor, induction of CYP3A4, can occur if they are applied together with axiase, potentially cause interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines, if they are applied in combination with axiase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as apgeneracy, as it can come to restipsis.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulgar drugs known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amspeccar can lead to a humiliation of the plasmash gel by Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of Calciumkanalblock such as Amlodipin, cotodipin, Nicotdipin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin, Narandipin and Verapamil can be increased by Amspecavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with asgenerase can increase considerably increase its Plasmakonzentrations and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors in combination-effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden, while the endogenous cortisol rose by approximately 86% raging (90% non-commercial interval of 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of maple with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these Glukokorticosteroids, unless the potential benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors like Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced spotting of the plasmaspiegels at the simultaneous administration of Aduase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because Plasmaspiec increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amspecavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabilization of the mirror, as the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of ampavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Aduase may not be applied together with oral biased midazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same time being offered by Aduase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinbitors indicate a possible increase in the plasmash gel of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opial symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the slight glassiness of historical comparisons can currently be given no recommendation, such as the speckled avir- dose is to be adapted when Amspecavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With the simultaneous use of warfarin or other oralen anticoagants along with Aduase, an increased monitoring of the INR (International Standards Agency) is recommended for the possibility of depreciation or reinforcement of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predicted, therefore also alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the simultaneous gift of Aduase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug should only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliberation of potential use for the mother compared to the possible risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated rats were proven ampavir-related substances, however, it is not known whether Amspecavir passes over people into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study at tolerable rats, administered by the inhalation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed during the downtime a diminished increase of 12 body weight at night experience.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including Fertilisation and Reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of amspecavir to the cervical animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Aduase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Aduase treatment were light to moderate, occurred early in and led rarely to the treatment quarry.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear if they are applied to HIV treatment, whether they are applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side-effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROF3006), in which proteasformer were not subject to patients 1200 mg Aduase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), which have been standing by the investigator as in connection with the study media, and in more than 1% of patients were performed, as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral therapy has been associated with an redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV patients, including a loss of peripherals and fast-skin tissue, increased intraoinal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophies and dorsofter fat collection (pins).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretrovirally, non-negotiated persons, which were treated with amspecavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine on a medium duration of 36 weeks was observed only (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTF (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) at 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually easy to moderate, inherited or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and appeared generally during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with amspecavir had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV infected patients with severe immunodeficiency therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI passed patients, the 600 mg Aduase twice daily along with low dodase treatment (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes, which received amongst patients, the Aduase together with low dosified Ritonavir, very frequently occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Spectrr binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protein and thus prevents the process of process viral and gag polyprotons with the result of a formation of immature, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amspecavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in acutely and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as at peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amspecavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µm in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of speckled against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of the HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretrotreated patients with the currently approved Fosamspecavir / Ritonavir-dosages, were rarely observed with other Ritonavir treatment regimen with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations rarely observed.</seg>

<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug operations, even though the occurrence of undesirable pharmaceutical reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydrolysses of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate maintenance of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and from cells into Lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme have been studied in a randomised, double blind, placeable Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients have been recruited for the study the total disease spectrum was the majority of the patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient referred to the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited when they had a forciated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 feet.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage amendment to the expected FEV and the absolute pavement in the 6-minutches.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where it received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to see which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage of percentage of percentage. FEV is not significant over this period and the total pneumonia heightened increases in proportion to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatteralie before treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the Gag-mirror in the harn (µg / mg creatinin) was determined that remained constant down to the degree of study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease, between the patient, which was taken into consideration clinically significant changes, the clinically significant changes, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was conducted a one-year-old open phase 2 study conducted mainly on the safety and pharmacogenetics of Aldurazyme at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the severe form of form and 4 with the middle form of form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- Spiegel in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (s = 3 years) and all 4 patients with the middle form of the form are a normal mental speed of development, whereas in the older patients had been able to determine only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, studies have been conducted on pharmacodynamic effects of different aldurazyme-dosage schemata at the Gag-Spiegel in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a reasonable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemata is equal.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is applied together with cisplatin (a different drug against cancer) in patients who have not been removed yet (by an operation alone) and "malignant" (malignant) and "malignant" (malignant cancer) has already become slightly spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attacks the epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens as single therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take during the treatment with Alimta a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, should be given before or after the gift of Cisplatin in addition a 'Antiemetic' (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a fluid deficiency).</seg>

<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed in its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothurn, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which previously had been treated with chemotherapy, compared with the effects of docetaxel (a different drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin, survived at an average of 12,1 months, compared to 9.3 months during the allotation of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at Docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies patients, however patients with which cancer did not attack the epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta longer survival rates than with the comparational medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for further 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also obtain an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first Pemetrefraction dose as well as after every third type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In case of patients who received Pemetrexed, every gift should be created a full blood picture - including a differentiation of the leucocytes and a thonism list.</seg>

<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a Dosage check must take place under the bridging of the Nadirs of the blood bilty or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predictive therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3 that apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients should develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted if in patients following 2 doses reduction or non-hematological Toxicity degree 3 or 4 occur or so - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, in comparison with patients aged 65 years, an increased side of side effects is increased.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data on insensitivity and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a creatinin Clearance Clearance by ≥ 45 ml / min no Dosage adaptations were necessary to go beyond the Dosage adaptations for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients were examined with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or transaminasenumeration of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper border value (for the presence of liver cleanings) not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone-friendly environment and Pemetrexed should not be administered to patients prior to their absolute neutron's count once again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thymus-number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrolean number, Throspinal rate and a maximum-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and nidermatologic toxicity like Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neutropenie was beised if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients need to be instructed to be treated with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for reduction of immune-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinin Clearance Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous taking of non-steroidal anti-acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindfulness Tens 2 days after therapy with whiemetxed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy with Pemetrexed is intended to avoid intake of NSAIDs with long semi-time limit for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with whiemetxed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid composition, accumulation is intended in the transcellular space to obtain a drainage of the result before Pemetrefraction treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myokardor attack, and cerebral vascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attendefied agents (except gel fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible skull of the reproductive-ability due to Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment regimen to solicit advice on spermaimitation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 mash / min) can lead high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistical (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylate in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily), causing a decreased line of effects caused by side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 mb / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Actutylsaline acid are applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindfulness Tens 2 days after therapy with Pemetrecxed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interactionpotential as with NSAIDs, such as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application has to be avoided with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Standards Agency) when the decision was made to treat the patient's ducks with oral anticoagants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetting in pregnant women, but as with ande- Antimestolites are expected in a treatment of severe birth defects during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrecxed should not be used during pregnancy, except if strictly detection and after careful deliberation of use for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible skull of the reproductive capacity is made, men should be advised before the treatment beginning to get advice on the sperm count.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied for chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy regimens, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as a antilever).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group, not enough information is available.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance will prevent the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of the patients treated with aloxi had no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients with Ondansetron's patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate triggering for nausea and vomiting are 81% of the patients treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">With a comparison with Dolasetron these figures in 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki n Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transporting of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: to prevent acute symptoms and vomiting at strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer treatment and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate-etogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one before chemotherapy given corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonotic tron is able to extend the colon age, patients should be monitored with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after the injection engmaschig.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the simultaneous administration of Palonotic tron with medicines that prolongs the QT interval or in patients where the Qt- interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides in connection with a further chemotherapy agents, aloxi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies hemmed Palonotic tron does not contradict the activity of the five investigated chemotherapy in the five studied chemotherapy, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, no significant pharmacular interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonotic tron and a Steady-state- concentration of oralen Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacotic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-inductors (amiodaron, Cimetidin, Halxorubicin, Halxorubicin, Halinicaine, chionavir, seronavir, Sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonotic tron at human wrencies are not before, therefore, Palonotic tron should not be applied at pregnant women unless it is necessary by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials the most common at a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (total 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with aloxi in relation to headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive reactions and reactions to the administration place (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of undesirable events showed themselves like in the other dosage; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the high distribution volume, a dialysis probably is not an effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2 ccyclophosphicin and 250 micrograms / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicine (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received intravenously on day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 ccyclophosphatin, and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonotic tron received, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron received that day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonotic tron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc-Intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetrion.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the clinical studies, Palonotic tron has the ability to block the ion channels in ventricular and repolarization and extend the duration of action potentials.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was assessing the EKG-effects of i.V. administered Palonotic tron in single dosen of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorcription After intravenous gift follows an initials of the plasmakonzentrations a slow Elimination from the body with an average season period of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum Plasmakonzentration (Cmax) and the surface area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally generally in the entire dosage range from 0,3- 90 μ g / kg with gestures and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosis tron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase from day 1 and day 5 measured size (± SD) increase in the Palonosis tron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulations emerge that once a daily intravenous form of 0.25 mg Palonotic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value of 0.75 mg total number; however, the Cmax was higher after the submission of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metrones compared to Palonotic tron about less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on Metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, the IsodiCYP3A4 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the Metabolism of Palonosis tron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonotic tron was found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonotic tron was considered an immutable drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolusinox, the total body-condition was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver dysfunctions are the terminale elimination of elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonotic tron, however, a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only according to expositions that are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies revealed the evidence that Palonotic tron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonotic tron (each dose corresponded in about the 30times of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which resulted in a daily frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses used and since aloxi is intended for a unique application, the relevance of these results is negligible to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns voiced that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug will not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon Retardant the disease has more patients back on the reference point of reference; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test has been evaluated in the study on how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied for the treatment of impetigo (a combined skin infection) and small infected Lazarus (Riss- or intersection), scruptions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections which are verifying or presumably caused by methicillinresistente sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against these types of infections may not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface at 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial strap (the parts of the bacteria, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indebator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was submarcated after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin connections Altargo and cefalexin similar contact rates: when the results of both studies have been collected at home-hours, about 90% of patients of both groups referred to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies however, however, that Altargo has been caused in the treatment of abscesses (time-filled hollow in the body tissue) or by infections that have been profoundly caused by MRSA, are not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small inconsistencies, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for approval for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which are no improvement within two to three days should be investigated once and to be considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitization or severe local confusion by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be interrupted, the salbe carefully wipes and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen, or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary ingenious wound, the effectiveness of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin of sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected passage occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of reapamulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plastic decentrations, which were achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant inhibiting in vivo not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% reapamulin Salbe on the meager skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dosisadaptations are not deemed to be necessary when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that apply Altargo was the most commonly reported side-effect irritation during the administration, which is approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of pleuromutilin, a substance, which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckery (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The drug mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protectionthesis by interacting on a specific bond of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the ties of other ribosomal anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bond rating of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-bonds and the Peptidyltransferasecentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment in this bond, pleuromutiline the Peptidylitter, blocking partial P-bonds interinteractions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance to the use of reapamulin should appear with at least some infection forms, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to methane.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-reference to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Metoration In a study with healthy adult was taken 1% reapamulin saline daily under occlusion on intact and ported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% reapamulin saline twice daily for 5 days for the topographic treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plastics were obtained.</seg>

<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of reapamulin in human liver microbes was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, taking small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult identical ingredients, some of the data included the application of Twinrix adult, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody therapeutics one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the final injection of antibody therapeutics against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side-effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of petitions, pain in the injecting location, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may respond to patients who may have hypersensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic), not being used.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. an approval for the transport of Ambirix all over the world</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardization plan for the Grundimmation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, the corresponding monoval vaccines or with a combinant pulp can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis BCs (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis type (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis-A-Virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monoval vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed up, whether immuno-competent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccination may require a refresher pattern as protection, as it may be protected by immunological memory due to immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the use of the vaccine, appropriate options for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the Combinational simple, the 360 ELISA units formulating viral hepatitis-A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of inmodialysis and persons with disturbances of the immune system, under circumstances there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody that may be required in these cases the gift of further vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intradermal injection or intra-muscular administration might lead to a subtle impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thyrospinal fluid or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type (DTPa-IPV / Job) or with a combined masking mumps Vine vaccine administered was the immune response to all antigens sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective, that may not be made sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matrices, Gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency associated with the former Thiere and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix compared with that of the 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and skill on a computation per vaccination dose, but not on a computation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed according to the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the test, compared with 39.1% in the test after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the probanden that received Ambirix had been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.6% at the test subjects, which were vaccinated with the 3-Dosage comb.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mats was similar high (i.e. over the entire vaccine-cycle at 39.6% of the probanden that received Ambirix compared with 36.2% in the test that received the 3-doses complacements).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of the pain and mould was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the composite simpy with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general arrangements in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that which is observed with the 3-doses combinationmaterial with 360 ELISA units formulating viral hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, at the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was a frequent appearance of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per protape, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that schematic over heavy side-effects during the 2-doses vaccination program with the combination of 360 ELISA- units formulating viral hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B- surface antigen, was not different statistically.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years, Seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversions for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year olds, 142 two doses were Ambirix and 147 the standard combinationmaterial with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunogeneity was exhalted, the Seroprotechnical rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the table 2 and 6 after the gift of 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunoresponse that were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11-year-old one month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations were either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with ambient or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units formulating viral hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of primers aged between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies have been detected at least 24 months after the immunisation associated with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The investigational immunoresponse against both antigens in this study was comparable to that, after vaccination of 3 doses with a compound simple, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivating Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface in a tin volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies can be compared to immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccination scheme, which is in the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose is ambirix in the second year at the same time with a refresher diphonic, tantaneous and 8 Haemophilus influenza type, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPa-IPV / hib), or with the first dose of a combined measles vaccine administered (DTPa-IPV / Hib), was the immune response to all antigens sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for current formulation of similar seroprotechnics and seroconversions such as the former formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (laughter) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect fully before an infection with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, although the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines that are infected with hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick,) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those according to a viral hepatitis or hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has been an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any component of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can vary through juckling skin strikes, breathing difficulty or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B in your child. • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B quickly (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you with your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A- / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis-A-virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered for one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is suffering from individuals who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, suffer from the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened with a disease or treatment in your / his body's own department, or if you / your child undergo a hoof-modifying / undermine.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases but the immune response to those individuals on the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is responding to the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix not administered pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is necessary that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have once again shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Very often (more than 1 case per 10 decimated doses): • pain or discomfort at the sticking site or redness • moderation • headache • headaches • appetite deficiency</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has been known since the issuance of the first permit for transports, the CHMP opinion considers that the benefit risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only brought to traffic in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete endocracy, or with hyperammontic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonary conformity) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps - split into several individual ins to meals - slured, mixed under the food or via a Gastrostomieschlite (through the abdomen in the stomach of leading flashoses) or a nose-sonde (by the nose into the stomach of leading flashoses).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonaps did not compare with any other treatment or placebo (a hypocritical medication that is to be compared with no substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ampmonaps can also cause loss loss, an abnormal low-loss in blood, depression, irritability, headaches, anxiety, hydration, flavors or taste of taste, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients infected with disorders of the urinary cycle to high ammonitions effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed with all patients in which a complete endocrine deficiency occurs already in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a beltmanifirm form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life of life), then there is an indication of the use when in the Anamnese a hyperammonial encephalopathy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with looptic disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein intolerance and for the growth and development necessary daily proteination of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenyl: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an earliest a shortage of carbylphosphor Ornithinimcarbylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininoscappase deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered in patients with looptic disorders, as a risk for the emergence of oils ophagus consists if the tablets do not enter into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and estrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolic isation and excretion of sodium polyphenylate occurs via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure should be applied only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neural multiplication and to a heightened loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cervical synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is left in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS stood at 56% of patients at least one undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by a 18 year old anortic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old baby-child with a longed single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go out with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neotoxicity in a intravenous form of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection, carried out by acetamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is left out over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is seen phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore regarded as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, diluted sodium polyphenylate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetyl glutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival-chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Prediction of the earliest shape of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost always infectist, and the disease itself resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with its stitial analogy within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium and sodium polyacetate), proteins, sodium and possibly substitutes by essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rates of newly-born at postpartal (however within the first life of life), diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac in the form of the condition (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the orniest transcarbbamase deficiency) that were recovering from a hyperammonteric encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium polybutyrate and a protested diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients may result in further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is construed in liver and kidneys, with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyat and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined by using a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenyl at sober healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the urinary Cycle, the Hämoglobular Present and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined by cancer patients according to intravenous form of sodium polyphenylate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylate in tablet form, 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plastic decentrates were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urethra-cyclical or hemostopathies, after varying doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning no phenylacetate in plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polyphenylate (20 g / day oral in three individual cases), the middle Phenylacetate concentric seals on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours of about 80 - 100% in the form of the counter-jug product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus test, sodium polyphenyl was treated with toxic and non-toxic effects (inquiry 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (infants and children that do not yet swallow tablets, or patients with eggs) or via a gastrostomieschlalso or a nose.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an earliest a shortage of carbylphosphor Ornithinimcarbylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium polyphenylate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metric of phenylbutyrate), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain rinses.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by a 18 year old anortic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometric is seen phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of surplus value</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle may be assumed that for each gram, sodium polyphenyl phate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetyl nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylate in granulatform, 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plastic decentrates were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary cells (ACS, decreased blood flow to the heart), for example in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardium (cardiac infection) without" ST- Hebung "(a anomalination of electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients which undergo from a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with Angina or coronary heart in maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS and in connection with a glycoprota IIb / IIIA-inhibitor (GPI, a different drug to prevent blood clotting) with conventional composite treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient often was a stent (a short tube, which remains in the artery to prevent a shutter) and they also received other medicines to prevent clots like Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, cardiology or vascularization) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected themselves to a PCI, Angiox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as heetin, except for heavy bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other shepherd, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI was an acceptable substitute for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for the transport of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronarsyndromes (instincts Angina / Non-Hebungsinfancy (IA / NSTEMI)) with an emergency attack or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdfrom Angiox in Patients with ACS is a intravenous shaft of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is carried out in another episode, an additional bolt should be increased from 0,5 mg / kg and increases infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, according to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initials of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and is one of the subsequent intravenous infusion using a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single bolus gift of Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, a second bolt should be carried out from 0,3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To be able to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney kidney cancer (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower inflation rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose is to be administered from 0,3 mg / kg and reviewing the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In case of patients with moderate kidney injury, which resulted in phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes of gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus without a dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney injury (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see below Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be introduced 30 minutes after the cessation of unquestionable heparin or 8 hours following the subcutaneous gift of low molecular siparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the substance or other components, or against braudine • active bleeding or increased blood stress. • severe uncontrollable hypertension and / or irreversible hypertension. • severe kidney injury (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are treated carefully during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if with PCI-patients under Bivalirudine, most bleeding may occur at arterial puncture, in patients who occur to a percutaneous coronary force (PCI) during the treatment in principle everywhere up bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, the monitoring of the INR-Werts (International Standards Agency) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bivalirudine will be restored prior to the treatment of existing levels.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombozytenschemmer) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In case of a combination of bivalirudine with thyself-aggregationers or anticoagants, the clinical and biological skins parameters are regularly updated in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental studies are inadequate in regards to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the disclosure or postnatal development inadequate (see below Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable braparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding played by Bivalirudine alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor and Bivaliprints plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracellular blood, intracellular blood bleeding, hematula, hemicular blood levels, decreased by ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood test, resurgery due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding locations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrootal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In the event of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudine will immediately break off and the patient engmaschige in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinpump, which binds both at the catalytic Centre and the AnionenBinding region of Thrombine, independently of whether Thrombine is tied in liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible because Thrombin is splits up by Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, young people and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm, or administered as a continuous infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin insulin is very slightly different from human rights, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter activity as a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was evaluated in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indication of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance glycoslized hemostin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin is established.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal standard.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitively (allergic) to insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is considered to be subcutaneous injecting either in the area of the abdomen, the thigh or the delusion or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose-halogenesis and the diminished insulin delivery of insulin, insulin can be descends in patients with a restriction of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, the brand (adolescents), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, galvanized, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or cancelation of a treatment, in particular in patients with an insulaged diabetes, may cause hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and may make a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the substance profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at changing the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that can increase the blood sugar-sugar activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemic acid, angiotensin-Converting, fibrous, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidants, propoxylhen, salicylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-loosen, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenal coloration may be or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproduction oxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and humaneness in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-milk enters into human mother's milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trials listed out of clinical trials, grouped according to system classes and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the bait data cannot be invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, fear, unusual er- creation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, benommenities, more abounding hun-, changes of vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed, the injecting location within the injection range can be changed continuously, can result in the result of a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemic with consciousy can be treated by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to detect the general cause of severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous fork in the efficiency of insulin, insulin delivery is done faster and the duration is shorter than at hu- manem.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years of type-1 diabetes, insulin-application has been demonstrated by 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg a dose of disproportionate glucose levels, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucose levels, just like human.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin isulisin has twice as rapid efficiency as normal human beings and achieves the complete draft resolution about 2 hours earlier than human.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was visibly seen that at an application of insulin disease in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable posturic glycadian control is reached as with human normal age that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin is practised in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postnatal control was achieved as with human normal age, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is wasted in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is given as at human standard, the 2 mi- nudes are given prior to the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in Gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal age, 30 minutes (normal - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal standard, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
