the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , making them easier available .
for more information about using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the guide to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to upload these modules in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up .... open the car@@ p card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard modules out of the package ; add @-@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , which &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click here &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if any , delete .
the module An@@ pa@@ filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M building in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root notes of the document , example : the element , all other knot@@ s are under@@ elements of this root junction .
the &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IME content in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to allow the content of your local fil@@ es@@ ystems .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , conce@@ aled folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can be easily detected , if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , the FS@@ View profile ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX , command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ emap representation is a rec@@ tan@@ gle which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ ol@@ ding corner meaningful color@@ ations and let@@ tering settings .
the colour of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched on view of colour mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the pres@@ ach@@ ings or the illustration of a different file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can determine if enough space to display is present , or if the area of sub@@ ordinate rec@@ tan@@ gles should appear ( although therefore dis@@ appearing error can occur due to restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ emap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tan@@ gle .
with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be respected that the area is proportionate to the size of the item . in the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always maintained to represent the tigh@@ tening of entries and this framework needs space , which is then lost to sub@@ ordinate entries any longer . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square .
as distribution of the area of an order for sub@@ ordinate entries is carried out , the implementation is left up . here it is intended to divide and avoid space loss by frame getting beneficial the areas that are possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimal covered area for an entry via the menu item . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the parent area , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View , was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu with ex@@ tras , ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

an easy to use camera module will be provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras . of course , each medium and any card readers are supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; together work .
&amp; Check ; contains a fast image processing with base processing tools . you can use these to view your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it represents dirt professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ting using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour work@@ flow .
improved data base with much more met@@ adata , such as the camera , via the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; b ; programmes are also available for publication ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end user . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; nbsp ; try to explain the problem of problems or improvement of improvement as easy as possible for them . wherever you use , the Help menu contains a dialog with a strict link@@ age . if you use this link@@ age , your web browser opens a page in error handling system . all required information is already listed here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; Check ; is a project which is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer come together . if you send a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tised , then we would like to answer any questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , you may soon answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , however , you should be spoken in English , you should therefore be mighty in this language .
you can also visit the publication ; homepage visit to receive news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ died ; to learn .
the best start to get involved , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the report in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ came ; .
if you have been checking out ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ alog@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures displayed as base folders . &amp; digi@@ came ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the pass of the folder you will be able to show a progression like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check : thir@@ sty , reference the reference path throughout his depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folder , unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to get extraordinary folders and checking out by placing a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums are put into mine list no photos as symbols . you can change it by taking any photo from the album and disc@@ ard it on the folder . you will then find more details in the albums section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up at &amp; Check ; your digital camera will set up . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords , to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ camera support .
how you setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy to use camera module will be provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras . of course , each medium and any card readers are supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ came ; together work .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be realised as USB mass storage device . the camera will also use the picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; nbsp ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . as photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions over the serial port are slow , this connection now is outdated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photographs 2 needs to be created with li@@ bex@@ change support . the EX@@ IF support is needed by some li@@ b@@ g@@ et@@ photographs . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will possibly be able to see thumb@@ nail or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at all , is how easy to expand their functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ graphic , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . objective is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in almost any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
pulling and drop images everywhere : you can disc@@ ard an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is the one image not in keywords , date list or searching .
- a file selection makes it possible to lift you the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbols view . thus , the fil@@ tering will appear on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind will display symbolic views only if this row is displayed , you can configure it in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; represents an organized view to your photo@@ al@@ ben . these albums are stored in a single album tree ; these albums are stored on the disk after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties , or by date when the album was created first . the date may be changed in the features of the album .
in case you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to one album . choose the album Im@@ ported screen@@ shot .
to move or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and move it . in the then the passing menu you have to select whether the image can move through moving or copying . you simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album features , you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and change the right @-@ click menu .
album collections : are a method to highlight your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you choose from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums after date .
the buttons , average , newest : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . this is first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first entered an album &amp; digi@@ tised , the first image is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . this will help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the right @-@ click menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be found only in a collection and collections can not be scr@@ am@@ bled .
&amp; checking came ; supports input of key@@ word for individual photos in the area My sampling list left at the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the top view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin cables in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can generate all the thumb@@ nails in the menu ex@@ tras .
information on each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information this is , you can change about settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ cursor one moment rest over a picture . the screen@@ shot shows the most important properties including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot top in the section introduction to the main window will show such a help window .
photos are all , what it &apos;s about all about this . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them . you can reach all the functions required with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you may have the choice between viewing the images , a slide or editing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 image editing ... or click the right @-@ click menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide how you can edit your photos . with picture editing you can view your photos and change them .
it may occur that &amp; D came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the right menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how to adapt them to your needs , if your program does not count , you will find information in the &amp; b ; manual .
you should note that after the processing of other image processing programs can come to problems associated with the met@@ adata image . some programs do not store this data with , if you save the modified image . therefore , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ aming etc .
when checking , two options are available for rotating . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . please note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ tised , er@@ asing it in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image Dele@@ te or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ all@@ ot@@ te@@ quot ; organis@@ es your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses for this either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file .
selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the file view , so you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with key@@ word provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alogues . tags are sti@@ ckers who have been assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
if a key@@ word is selected , all the photos displayed with this key@@ word are shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here you can rest your keywords . you can also catch parts of the tree &amp; quot ; mine key@@ word quot ; together , so you can find the keywords which you are looking for .
the tags are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as it came ; the pictures were noticed .
you can add new tags by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or click on an existing keywords , and then select new key@@ word . if you have clicked a new key@@ word after you have clicked on an existing one , this is the bu@@ zz@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and click on the right @-@ click menu . you can edit the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; mine key@@ word quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as the album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
around &amp; Check ; s functionality with keywords , you first need to arrange your photos with keywords , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; mine key@@ word quot ; drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail plate on the preview images and assign from the right @-@ click menu .
you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo is shown once you choose one of the keywords to grant him a weigh@@ ted tags . this way you can select a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you open the right click menu of the photo , and select from the keywords menu . the menu only shows you the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view points a time @-@ dependent operative hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can select via this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ tan@@ gle of the selection framework , which indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
og@@ nom@@ er search box is a small lamp that is green when the search matches . if you click here , the fil@@ tering will be deleted and displays all pictures again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this search here however a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can have entered this search here as a live search , which is always fil@@ tering what you typ@@ ed as a search crit@@ erion . after being saved , he got the filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . if you want to change your search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select a option in its context menu .
when you select your search , the form to enter the search will be sent back with the previously used search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog appears for advanced search to change your previous search . here you find more rules for search . more information can be found in section The tool for the Advanced Search .
if you want to delete a existing search from the list , select in the right @-@ click menu .
the extended search provides you with an exten@@ sible search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in specific fields of &amp; digi@@ tised ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to add the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are added , separated from operators or deleted . each option can link to others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... create NO@@ HT@@ C ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create .
&amp; nbsp ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . using a s@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or shr@@ inking . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the icon of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then this will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand @-@ sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; checking out ; find the matching pictures . even here it can be a s@@ ell@@ ation value .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press it out on the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , set off your images Geo @-@ data included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folders .
&amp; Check ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image files , also raw files , together .
just select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lighthouse add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ table and open windows . if you are back in &amp; check ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ aire fast with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can easily drag the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you can preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar , and perform the Zoo or di@@ versions at one of the pictures , then those with the other image are also executed . so you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to pick out quickly from a picture series . if you use p@@ air@@ wise navigate out of the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will automatically display in the ranges . use the right next image is displayed in the right range . this will simplify it through a number of similar images to work through .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions work directly from the bul@@ let@@ table , such as F@@ 4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in a lumin@@ aire . this means , for example , it is easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in shot function which you can recognize in the crossed arrows . to get the visible area of the picture , you must click them and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode preview , both images will show the same picture .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to get into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory - off the fashion management ? digital inventory is considered every part of the process following the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos exc@@ els , sc@@ anned or digital photos leads a form of digital inventory by us . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , use , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedures for digital photographers and we use . we look at the procedure for digital photographers and we use . we look at the procedure for digital photographers , remove , convert , re@@ group@@ ed , re@@ archive , optimize , waiting and export of image files .

met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is designed according to your definition data , which provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely use not &amp; digi@@ tization ; . the approach to save met@@ adata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you maintain something in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored on your computer or on a network run &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday makers can quickly find out about your location , unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you want to use enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flow , constant mapping of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % are registered and you will then not want to re@@ organise your structure for that content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking @-@ processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to be stored in the setup page of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item on the album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which changes ? to do this , a met@@ adata editor will be available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work , as you should now select each photo keywords , let@@ tering and evaluation . of course , you can select all pictures that require the same attribute and then put the value then . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now talk with keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called upon other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alogues images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree for you will rebuild the pictures in the right place . the changing of hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by adding a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are monitored by &amp; digi@@ tised , while it pursu@@ es the underground .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata reveals itself . this is a very crude re@@ presentation , since each block of met@@ adata is made up of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to prot@@ ections or comments , the third important tool to cataly@@ ze your met@@ adata .
you just want to let your photos just see your photos , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream of dre@@ ary associations , memories , the historical time span has come back , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who view your photos is the title probably more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . think of the key it is the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand about the motive it moves you has to understand what you understand .
it is OK if an image is not perfect if it only has the strength to act with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as sign@@ posting . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE produces a spelling after your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web server system . you need to tell the story so for the op@@ ener is not a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation systems ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the move of the spatial presentation now comes with light speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already in@@ accessible and will be repeated in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can open your travel virtually . this then shows the photos at the entrance . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle@@ Maps collection .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a game of words with copyright and den@@ ces the practice of copyright , to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the furniture page of &amp; digi@@ ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for instance , the name of a company or organization may be used . after that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for writer ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working @-@ drawing of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note about the author &apos;s field , this field must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer does for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a photo photo , then the group / agency gives the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic know @-@ how in working with computers can clear or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to this .
digital water@@ marks per image is unique . &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the near future there will be such a module for st@@ acking .
themes : record errors , record , black@@ out , EC@@ C , transmission defect , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ecting , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same which can also happen to traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data collection in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must no longer be trusted for more than a few years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs within archiving . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe that is in your measurable room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good recording units and put them in the right way . best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns to select the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the format@@ ting and control of control . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that does appear wonders on CDs and DVDs , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar uses the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppies , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
op@@ tic media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . afterwards , read the media with a description , date &amp; author con@@ marks and after that in a clean , dark dry and above animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for yourself . your manufacturing party will include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study on the fault mechanics of hard drives : dis@@ fault @-@ study
in brief : dis@@ ks hold on the longest when you are operated in the temperature area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at a lower heat error , this error cannot be found . some of SM@@ ART announces the immediate pending withdraw@@ als . this is especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Publ@@ ishers . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the full loss loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric case before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices may not account much , this can cause severe damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processing boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ nating , hardware boards and other defects , so you can protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is a part of the energy @-@ heat absorbed by the rest . it is usually available in the form of a St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar . however , remember that not every St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then please note that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful that it offers protection against ligh@@ tening heat and thus protects the properly connected devices .
because an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be careful that also all per@@ pher@@ als are protected by your system . some manufacturers make over@@ voltage scor@@ er which also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable @-@ cable and television card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete cut . even an exception of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ tensions , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a black@@ out occurs . if you purchase an US@@ V , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the living period of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
concern you the potential risk , which is exposed to your billing system , and compare its safety with electricity problems with the costs of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can only be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your machine is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering that you can store any amounts of data .
they are at home compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suited to a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services provided on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online , in case of Flickr dramatic more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big firms is included in the offer a backup and a distri@@ bu@@ ed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ detected , that there should be no protection to your computer . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they create interference within the data flows . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with turn@@ tables at low level and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its original fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms which uses the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . with not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the seas . it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no more sighted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ inely , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the wi@@ dened fil@@ es@@ ystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ tured data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and a defined status will be avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the principal cause of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ ces of fundamental physical boundaries . meant that while the technology further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and sound @-@ characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ om@@ eters . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
thus , a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else &apos;s losses . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strike you lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about aircraft un@@ fortun@@ es : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are for your data dangerous enough . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ge@@ ars always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup who is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ations : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . generates a complete snapshot on two periods : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time by which such a backup has been made . this backup will come to a payment system the next one with the exception that it is yields and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync just the difference of files that really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
get important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure lets you discover enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come for securing a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for every month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , find images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be he@@ eded :
because the future is due to your nature unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able , you must consider everything that is said today using caution and re@@ evaluate it while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to be compatible with caution . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switching to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everybody . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s assume that you &apos;ve been planning the scal@@ ability with you and have placed the area you want to have on a dedicated album or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; reset / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
gif is a proprietary format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace G@@ IF . however , it is loss of loss , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG cannot save many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F and has a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed free and open raw format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required for the use of met@@ adata . a handful of cameras makes DN@@ G now available and we hope to use the co @-@ seekers of Canon and Nik@@ on .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; imaging technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is permitted with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your record , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP fits separate from the image file . however , there can be problems related to the link between the met@@ at@@ end@@ ate@@ i and the image file , and as mentioned above , the shell format is format@@ ted . therefore , you should consider if you use DN@@ G as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization which supports fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , which supports a wide range of application and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on camera edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert the raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine editing process you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were under circumstances cut off from other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web@@ galleries , co@@ ding you in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; check ; in section adding a photo to an album you will find a description , as you have photos , which you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for storing images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the machine , turn the camera on display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an item or its met@@ adata .
this dialog displays files properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera . an icon shows that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available all the information .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufactur@@ er@@ rati@@ fication , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata page bar , from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tised ; or picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata is not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; . downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired options available with the default methods of &amp; b ; as soon as you select the photos , use the button download and then download selected . the button is installed as long as you selected , until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will of course download the new pictures .
when you download the buttons all download or downloading , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums is displayed like regular folders . details of the folder you can read in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; Check ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the pictures you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , by using the button delete all . if you only want to delete some , then you need to select them first and then delete cookies .
note that there is no way to have photos taken from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin . so you should check carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should do so much faster , as this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once the photos from the camera are deleted . therefore , it can be useful to load the date and time when the picture was made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ eline @-@ based ap@@ ort . if you use this option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens up three more options that are carried out before the photos on the disk are stored . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different format format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in the editing environment the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the Help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , which is used , for a photo , is displayed below the name , displayed by the camera in the preview . their settings for ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera records next time .
&amp; Check ; can perform all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording , not all cameras put this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic turning is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply such information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the button Advanced and select the Autom@@ atic rot@@ ations in the bottom of the window .
if your camera will provide information about the date , where the photo is made available , it can create &amp; digi@@ tised . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available for this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you have to switch this option . use the button below and select the option file @-@ based lower jaw at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . select then up@@ loading . you can select the files , which you can select the files up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; b ; methods .
after the selection selection is done , asks &amp; checking came ; She , where the pictures should be loaded to the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphy an area by automated recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised , users wish to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position of a photo .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , through a post@@ processing of GPS data and images with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally about manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iPad A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on DS@@ LR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be processed with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract data from pictures and from GPS and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the anter@@ ior coordinates , which will be created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , who show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; Check ; try to give you as much control over his working procedures as possible . there are many settings to change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization ; to display at these settings , you have to change in the menu settings ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
action can be selected based on embedded preview or image editing . you therefore put the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised ; solid when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for downloading the camera point . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for writer : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. pilot photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description of the car box , this field must also be filled .
editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the image . this does not have to be the author if this is the picture other &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ eten@@ quot ; . if the picture is a photo photo , then the group or agency that is available to the picture is listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ adata is permanently available in the picture and not only came in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; . these met@@ adata stand also available to other programs and can be imported into account ; they will be imported without lost .
image black@@ s@@ ings as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images save : this synchron@@ izes the comments you want to add to your photos , with the indications embedded in the pictures . thus , your fittings can also contain cap@@ ri@@ ors , these may be over@@ written by the publication ; over@@ ri@@ dden .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window over a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to specify which data types , and video formats . to set , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list ; album trans@@ cription which has no such extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised .
the default settings can be reset you again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right from each category .
the settings of the lighthouse of clothing ; can be set on this page on the default values if possible . however , some pictures have turned out different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get better results . if you have one , then you can obtain better results .
by default , image editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with darker and brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in picture editing , this picture @-@ mode can be installed with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and will be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er explanation .
by setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can use this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option T@@ IF@@ F files compressed you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression age for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no effect on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is free .
with the setting of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can loss los@@ sy . even if you choose the los@@ sy adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ adata were not yet supported , but in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was only one image editor for photos . currently , it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the picture editing .
the default approach is that all green pixel are equal to ultra @-@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference produces a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the picture a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD standard method .
if this option is set , the white @-@ off camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour @-@ balance is used .
this setting is used only if the whit@@ ening is not set . standard it is a fixed colour balance , which was shot on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight .
this option is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ pin images in four steps will get more details in the sh@@ re@@ tention . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the default it is the nickname , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera they catch the top @-@ size results . the setting colors redeem some unusual results , as they re@@ construct the sh@@ re@@ porter in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the Spit@@ s@@ acks .
this is possible because blue pixels in general does not have to re@@ construct as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ shar@@ ks from the not yet saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when selecting the option re@@ construct , you get the option to bet a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ worth according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete picture from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered images that have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; D came ; and D@@ cra@@ b will provide you with three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you run during the dra@@ fting .
a profile transl@@ ates the color formations and gives instructions how this should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information like the color @-@ formations are to be translated into the other thus the colors are as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions , if an image is opened in image processing / color @-@ administration module with raw files .
color profile folder Set@@ ts you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / etc / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; Check ; this folder will examine then during Star@@ ts .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures coloured does not manage the entire screen .
input profiles should be applied to the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correct . currently , d@@ cra@@ b g@@ amma does not need to perform conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you have to carry out the color test itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be released from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated . you could manually correct it instead of having to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them for what is intended . unfortunately , here are a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ officially :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface which is supported by a number of &amp; che@@ que ; illustrated works and imaging works . through the willingness of this interface can be supported , many modules are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and they will then be loaded from &amp; digi@@ tised . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some also in the context menu .
short instructions for tasks implemented by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ts the time between the transi@@ tions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross@@ ings switch the met@@ adata one or off , which at the lower end of the pictures are displayed during the display .
the camera properties are on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , that is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . you are currently here the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage supported .
at the bottom end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage area . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / de@@ able , specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; Check ; you must connect the camera to your machine to switch it into the ad mode .
check out whether and checking , the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . once you set up your camera , your camera will be displayed in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; to delete a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting of a photo and delete an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly tac@@ itly , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to apply the changes to the button .
you can also download the display of the welcome imaging of &amp; digi@@ tised ; at star@@ tup under@@ tie . this will under circumstances under circumstances took the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ tised .
the setting up of Bei@@ m starts searching for new photos and check the base folders according to new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the launch level of &amp; digi@@ tization ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , asking for digi@@ tization ; you , if it is to delete them from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select you with settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; to create , you can find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Check ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and make correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the right @-@ click menu .
picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . therefore , some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; therefore you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can set up in the picture editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current date , the current date , and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top level , including the tool@@ bar to quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of picture editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you store file Save or the button Save out of the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original shot as soon as you have saved the picture .
you should therefore select a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Station Rest@@ ore or the button &apos; Rest@@ ore der Bild@@ editing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have performed on the photo since the last store .
virtually every action of image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting the back @-@ back or restored by selecting the re@@ connecting from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the short@@ cut short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the back@@ end and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift key to Rest@@ ore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer , click on the reg@@ istrar or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a right @-@ click menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started working editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have changes in the current photo , you are asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ sich@@ ord menu .
to custom@@ ize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically .
view full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you come in the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ cape key . if you do not want this , you can call this in the dialog dialog of &amp; digi@@ tization ; change this . you can call this in the dialog dialog by &amp; digi@@ tised . you can also view this section for viewing the picture editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select image in the menu and get the standard &amp; c@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . you just need to select the images from your selection . you just need to select the pictures selected using the default methods and select from the menu Ex@@ por@@ e printer . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; D came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions available for the selected photos . the same page bar is available without the Navig@@ ation@@ sp@@ elt , also available in picture editing . it is shown when one of the five riders is clicked :
multiple clicks on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or will disappear into the edges .
in the description of resolution you can enter or insert conf@@ is@@ ations with unlimited size . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC feeding field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented on , you either use the button application or simply switch to the next picture , the signs are then stored .
besides the user @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also send the met@@ adata to the files . however , this is always performed if you chose a met@@ adata default that is always written into the pictures .
the section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the right @-@ click menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keywords show a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keywords @-@ tree and a selection box with the before in this &amp; digi@@ tised ; session shown key@@ boards .
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word fast . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you typ@@ ed several keywords , they will be stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding attacks in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , and you can select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire range , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the page bar stit@@ ched filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords , and view@@ points are used . if one or more key@@ b filter is used out of the right side , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag tags and disc@@ ard . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view , to provide you with key@@ word . if the keywords already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and on the selection . then , a dialog appears , you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper case , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keywords filter is written on No keywords , which has been chosen with C@@ tr@@ l + a and afterwards a key@@ word was drawn from the right spot tree to the selection and set there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be subject to settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or its , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and the rules .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a complete search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just need to use the cross@@ roads at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited there on 1 GB , and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color@@ full @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors available from your camera or scanner come a predictable devi@@ ation of the actually photographed and sal@@ ted colors . using a color@@ full @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor , those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web that match them from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everybody wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information on colour management . in addition , you will provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all the criteria below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB version . ( further information can be found below )
your only other pictures are via e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works as well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and make your thoughts about colour management ?
a visual example of Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ bre@@ w , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on info and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to kal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ bre@@ m ?
yes ! whether you are working at s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ ms or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , da s@@ R@@ GB , you need to work out the circle . if you work as in the Far@@ use of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual process .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automation , and contrast extend from the menu Kor@@ rigi@@ dly automatic correction attempt to automatically make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values about the whole picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shades . this feature is often a magnet for pictures that are dark or washed out .
same : this method j@@ us@@ hed the lighthouse factor of colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ olog@@ ram of the intention is the same number of pixel . sometimes it achie@@ ves very good results in improving the contradiction of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful surgery that causes either miracles in a picture or it is destroyed .
automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the rot@@ - , green@@ - and blue channel . it defines the dark and bright border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hed the rot@@ - , green@@ ish and blue @-@ channels on the entire hist@@ ograms .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in out@@ ward images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ b@@ out of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ like correction is a bit limited because of a color @-@ bit with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can perform the white @-@ bit in the raw mode , which in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better displayed .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent de@@ generation of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu @-@ containing colors white @-@ off of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target picture . if you want to see the original white sand , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the h@@ olog@@ ram .
right upstairs , a h@@ olog@@ ram is shown that dynamic when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as soon as you have one parameter . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow of alignment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even download .
An@@ stat is to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the cap@@ tions to use selected color for the calculation of color @-@ temperature of the white @-@ layer . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally you can set the white @-@ off with the pres@@ ets list . the following settings are available :
the Over@@ view indication increases colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will get the combined result displayed in the white @-@ screen . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this . any adjustment of the white comparison you have set you can save in a text file and load later again .
the default settings sets all fil@@ tering values back to their default values and the associated neutral whi@@ ps . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you store this image your original image is changed .
you can adjust here the code @-@ loop per colour channel of the working image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding requires also more disk space , computing time and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ si@@ can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the brightness of color profiles . detailed instructions for the use of colour pro@@ fil@@ s can be drawn to the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu with colors sound correct . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for the key correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool f@@ lange effects puts you four folding effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter available .
in times of chemical processing was solar , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of this was created when one completed a partial pressure of a short flas@@ h@@ light . this had the effect that the ligh@@ tly ranges were inver@@ ted and the colors inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fin@@ ely .
the intensity controls the solar ization . at about 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates an neg@@ ativity that so did not produce at phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar impact . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation effect that it has a stronger contra@@ sting effect , which makes colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the aw@@ ame for one on day@@ light optimized paint movie produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors at day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a movie of choice for natural photo@@ ograph@@ s . Vel@@ vi@@ as heavily saturated colors are also some photo@@ ograph@@ s , especially those which hardly any landscapes are inten@@ tional .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ indications . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can pick the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the tools in the menu with colors . all your adjustment can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a picture with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce a good choice to increase surgery . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma is the tool audio @-@ correct to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated , you need for the application in use only the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms .
the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity values , a hist@@ olog@@ ram , the active canal or the selected range . below the graphs are three sli@@ ders into which they can change in , and they can be moved to change the intention &apos;s values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to operate the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear representation is frequently dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear history is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic inser@@ tion is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ m .
the three colored pin@@ p@@ allets can be used in the sne@@ ak of the original image to automatically adjust the input @-@ rated of shadows , middle and bright notes automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
exit status : the selection rated allow the selection of manual value for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators who can be used to change the pay@@ roll inter@@ acting as with the input points . for example , the compression of the pay@@ roll can be used for example to create a sealed image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the image of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem can be saved and loaded later . it will be used to Gimp the format .
if you use this mode and use the three color tubes , the input @-@ rated is automatically re@@ activated for all shadows , means and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for the input of the hist@@ ograms for red , green@@ ish , blue and lumin@@ ata channels .
the option over@@ loaded In@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display more exposed pixels and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input areas applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the exit status is unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modifications Channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the module changed by the module :
besides this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of sensory mode . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps you further .
if you &apos;d like to post@@ p@@ one a cur@@ ny to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright sounds with darker spin @-@ ga@@ des and that the image pixel darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each bend that you have created can be saved in fil@@ es@@ ystem and loaded later . file format is the Gimp format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ets buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , central and solar tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the rot@@ or , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ escent curve .
the option over@@ loaded In@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ load pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ l@@ acked pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and white picture which was corrected in the lumin@@ ous canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixing mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change color shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors canal bl@@ ender of image editing .
using the canal box you can select the color for the h@@ olog@@ ram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window will show you a preview . the original can be seen in comparison with the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you can position this in the picture a vertical line in the h@@ olog@@ ram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve the appropriate color components , since the channel bl@@ ender can also enable the option to generate great black and white conver@@ sions for your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise which occurs from the col@@ ts . color consists of small rou@@ gh@@ o@@ des , which looks different from the same spot . if that is the case you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion through which you can reduce the color test first .
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting you can save it for later and then download . the used file format is the Gimp Mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ loaded In@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display more exposed pixels and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the Blue canal became new . the original image is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , as color images can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
Grün@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a green lime filter . this looks good , with all the scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
Oran@@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a orange filter filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic economy effects and can sim@@ ulate res@@ c@@ rested on day @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones , while he adds a little bit col@@ dness into the sl@@ ump of a pressure and the re @-@ development in one S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the thrust of an old master , a pop kind of portrait made of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper text effect was applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping an eye on the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to sc@@ rolling eye . under picture frames can add the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired course type for your image . throughout the image with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide framework ( ideal for black and white images ) , exhau@@ sts handle it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a ornam@@ ental with patterns .
width : sets the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio is important for the printing of images , especially if you have used the mold after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image of any position . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from the color size and the character set with its features as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . the picture is ready .
each setting that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture was once saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil apply you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Picture Sch@@ abl@@ one can be used in image editing , in order to put messages about a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to re@@ vis@@ ing the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your Sch@@ abl@@ one of the template database , so you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mailing list checking came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you must put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil template . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils was set out , a tree @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil template . selecting a folder updated the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils automatically .
among the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button aug@@ mented the image below . it is cent@@ red around the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ red around the mouse position . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must re@@ scale the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; checking , three different tools are available for raising . each one of you has advantages in other areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ ks . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask is working at the contrast of the edges to look at an image shar@@ per . you can use it to remove atmospheric dark and it is here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the edge . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus and most digital images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to that the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be summ@@ ed up with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more down@@ stream than normal cameras for private users .
at JP@@ EG images often a camera has been applied internal boo@@ ths . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner should turn to the focal filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable them , you get control of your picture .
in some situations , you can get useful results by raising up a photo with the edge of shar@@ pen . this allows you to call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you should deal with this , however , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ens increases the edges of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image re@@ focus on . you can reach it via the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ dity . below re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ ks .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is much easier than shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool to switch to the soft@@ ness with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ dity , and experiment with something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter in@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview look at the image . the preview display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask become strong , ru@@ stle and the impression of fre@@ ats will produce near sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a can@@ oe hit by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ os . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image one that is added to the original . this will put the strength of ac@@ ut@@ eness .
the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference between the difference . it can thus define a minimum difference for a can@@ oe of filters . in this way areas are avoided with a soft switch between the tones of shar@@ ks and hence beauty errors in faces , Heav@@ ens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the edge . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted unfolding for the algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ ing quot ; in which there is a better approach than just trying the photo . it is used to focus on a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technology to sharp@@ ens images is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask . you can usually start better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can start it out of the menu by viewing colors re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung leads to a very long tail , that depends far from the source pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular acu@@ ity : this is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most pictures the default value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red , but should pay attention to Heiligen@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 rarely useful . if the smoke filter is too low , the filter quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further lubric@@ ated .
gau@@ ze &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ze &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equ@@ aled zero , you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoke filter .
mould size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational atri@@ x . an increase in the size of the transform@@ ative size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular acu@@ ity or gau@@ ze &apos;@@ schen sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module will be very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitrary parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and intention @-@ points on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that plenty of operations changes are not immediately visible , but which later left un@@ convenient ar@@ te@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress pictures , more than JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ cara produce better results than shar@@ ks . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood used as ac@@ ut@@ ov@@ ens .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of un@@ shar@@ per filters . for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter . virtually is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in treating small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp paint picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to unlimited light for the car @-@ focus Lin@@ se .
for more information on the methods of raising visual correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ tte continues the sharp@@ ness of the area of the bot@@ tled water to produce a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool @-@ failed tool is one of the most widely developed tool to remove no desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm has been developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ E@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets than starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
in case you want to use the fil@@ tering settings to a j@@ us@@ y you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
deta@@ il@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a smaller value leads to an even more homo@@ geneous regions smoo@@ ther and details bl@@ ur . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is in@@ toler@@ able . please note that the details of the details of the machine addiction should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
traction addiction : alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film body , or C@@ CD Rau@@ e will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best removed from 1 value near 1 .
gl@@ az@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximal smoo@@ thing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , put this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thes , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm goes through . usually , here is 1 or 2 .
Win@@ kel@@ o @-@ long da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should also be small for a long term . therefore , you should therefore choose to have this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de wide into pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation uses : the more quality you get through choice of this option is only low . it doubled but the run@@ time . we recommend it to you .
the buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this . each adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
images correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking at any time .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected using one arti@@ facts . the module is made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad filming during the trip ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; D came ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease imaging . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable cap@@ tive filters available to remove stain@@ s and other ar@@ te@@ facts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor det@@ ectors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ char@@ ute ; remove effects of sc@@ anned images made of books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor extracts from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ny smoking that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large numbers increase the time the filter per pixel and can blur@@ red the image . the area covered by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thes and hence minor errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focal point . this value sets the pixel filter to as@@ certain . if it is lifted up , smoke det@@ ects will change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image can no longer receive and smo@@ ker or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the fil@@ tering . if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise , if you want to remove it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a narrow smo@@ ker or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or energy @-@ density to improve a picture . these settings don &apos;t affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour @-@ intolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or energy @-@ density to improve a picture . these settings don &apos;t affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker areas , which typically become stronger , but he also performs the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up , the edges appear smoo@@ ther . if he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . he can remove spac@@ es@@ p@@ tips and is the recommended method for it .
save under and loading : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for the smoking reduction that you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the reduction of smoking was applied with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to exc@@ el the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than an image to sharp@@ ens and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; nbsp ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to show Gau@@ ß &apos;s sound , film @-@ based , compres@@ sive and local mistakes that emerge in digital , original or subsequently digital images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the picture cont@@ ours and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the algorithm can be used for colour and text replacement . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression age , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; ar@@ te@@ facts ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude should correct these problems .
the buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ like noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film@@ makers on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , textures was reduced to an old color photo , which has been read with a scanner , which was caused by scanning lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression of hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixel quot ; to remove a photo with a dark @-@ image method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you have the dark picture directly after you to discover new hot or bright pixels through c@@ CD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark &apos;s image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant picture the last dark picture and it will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture . the preview display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all areas of view .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pin this pix@@ el@@ blocks . this is the available Filter :
Dur@@ ing : there will be an average of the neighbour pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pin the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn up to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then is used to inter@@ pin the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ o : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be approached to comp@@ el a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then is used to inter@@ pin the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; D came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ merged corners , an image .
fores@@ een lenses , particularly those in medium and large photo@@ format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achie@@ ves the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses also show this behavior .
however , it also has disadvantages . many center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ een lenses should use , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the sharp@@ est effects caused by movement arise .
with the big expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tering and / or gray @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equi@@ valence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three rec@@ tors you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ ktur filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : these parameters checks the degree of light stimulation at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ates a optical filter with a speed adjustment of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a density of vig@@ net@@ ting to a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ance , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the loading of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will provide you only positive values , as you need to increase the settings only .
if you want a better adjustment of the exposure of the goal , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . a lumin@@ ance and contradiction time was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; D came ; Lin@@ ked distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des covers the general geom@@ etric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ exe form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ wed but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , any geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of second gra@@ ins . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected , and positive values cus@@ hion @-@ shaped distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of Gra@@ des . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has gener@@ alized the reverse sign of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value sc@@ aled the image size , and thus leads a correction of the first Gra@@ des through . negative values increase while positive the picture res@@ cent .
brigh@@ tly : this value j@@ us@@ ates the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tions correct . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as default values .
the ton@@ n@@ - or cus@@ hion correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . the best result is to cut this correction as of all first . if you make a picture anew , and then , a t@@ onal correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction is provided to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place like e.g. the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can correct the ton@@ n@@ - / cus@@ hion wi@@ ping with the help of the lines .
when you rec@@ ti@@ fy a gra@@ dient , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers from the image processing or over z@@ oom rep@@ el of this dialogue .
for most pictures the tone @-@ shaped correction is drawn . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. photographs from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ n@@ form correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate inf@@ rar@@ ed film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ o.@@ org website that is accessible from this URL . the filter reproduced the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ed movie , see this URL . this movie has a Sensi@@ tive area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to sim@@ ulate film gra@@ ff@@ ness and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of the body gran@@ ules and the dominance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter channels make to reproduce by inf@@ rar@@ ed movie , especially the green channel , it doesn &apos;t make sense the effect on black / white photographs , as the color @-@ formations are missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ rar@@ ed filter effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ tention .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filters film gra@@ ins is an easy to use tool to reproduce film@@ makers on your pictures . this is known by classical high speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , the manufacturer of great silver gran@@ ules of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ des effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , cable photographic , gran@@ ular image especially into your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ man photos , you must use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values need to be needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film body effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter Oil painting produced the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter Oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper el@@ ects the brush between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better for bigger images . smooth the glasses or , viewed from the other side , the magnific@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the working is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush @-@ size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and Tro@@ se@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; D came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensive gra@@ dient to create a carbon dioxide . the lines that change the cont@@ ours in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator chooses the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ ts the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved further through adaptation of the intention .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was be@@ amed in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; D came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and this processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it is used by protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ flo@@ cks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of shar@@ pen effects . it is used by protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the picture along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness an zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in the sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sol@@ ves : blur@@ ring the image by rotation of the pixels to a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removing p@@ onder@@ ings : caught the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
mobility sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal moves of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographs , camera .
soft@@ ness wir@@ es : blur@@ ring the image soft at the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or for adding a warm and subtle bul@@ b .
s@@ ut@@ sh@@ un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : blur@@ ring the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent im@@ measur@@ ments : finds the color@@ ations in the picture and cat@@ ches it without changing it without the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pix@@ el@@ wert , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dro@@ plet size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the dro@@ plet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish stocks changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; nbsp ; picture editing a area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter drops , the area will stay free of rain drops .
this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirror or turning into the correct orientation . the tools you can find in the menu trans@@ former or trans@@ former mir@@ rors .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ubs is simple . the big question is how can you zo@@ oming an image and bl@@ ur the details ? how can you inv@@ ent the missing information again ? how can you inv@@ ent the missing information again ? how can the missing information be used again ? how can you use the missing information here , make a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to change size uses a linear application method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio maintained : if this option is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thes , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons are saving as and the shop will be used precisely for them . each single unit for photo can enlarge as a text file and loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and drag a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color screen to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard increase in comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequent run @-@ run operation , but also a commonly underestimated tool to put an image . image processing allows you to just use the rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rec@@ tan@@ gle . you will then see this rec@@ tan@@ gle while you are moving the mouse while watching the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can draw the size of one to the cutting area by creating a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the dis@@ section , use the button &quot; Add @-@ button of the machine editing in the tool@@ bar , and the photo is designed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file saving under the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the view , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
in the mold after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to width .
the tool Up conver@@ gence uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in dialogue , you can set the area with the Max . relationship button to cutting the maximum possible , depending on your chosen relation and orientation .
the tool Up brack@@ et stores its settings dependent on the orientation ( horizon horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables and not the original image .
the settings of the combination assistance allow help to set up your images , so that you can better set your pictures better . these aid are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of the similarity . like the third @-@ party gel , the harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to ran@@ gle a rec@@ tan@@ gle into the same harmon@@ ic triangles .
Golden Center : the golden middle is a division which sets out different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us snail or the leaf @-@ blades of a sun flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two for@@ ego@@ ing numbers . the origin@@ ating divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that this rule is seen as visually harmon@@ ic .
the golden middle puts li@@ minal auxili@@ ary lines if you put an image below . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third watch , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the picture . this type of composition guides the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etrical visual flow .
another rule is called the justification of the golden spiral , also Golden triangles . these rectangular corner are used to create the golden spiral . this can be something or different objects . this one can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles are also guided by the golden spiral lines at the top . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equivalent to these lines . di@@ ag@@ onal to put on these lines can be a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame , create an effect of professional photo@@ graph@@ ed dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ontal flip and Ver@@ tically flip can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic parts .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any corner .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things have turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose to convert free rotation and j@@ us@@ se your target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are stated in degrees . with the button preference you can set the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
for your help , the module will provide free rotation and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the visual inspection to position the two lines . once you move across an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you describe the angle as described in previous section .
once you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transform@@ ers cutting from the picture editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all spec@@ ulative transform@@ ers are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area .
angle right upstairs : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area .
angle right down : displays the current angle to degree at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
depending on the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little bu@@ zz@@ ling . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create an twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible .
after which you fit the perspective you get un@@ welcome tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to do this , it &apos;s the image with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing .
the mould tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the picture in one direction and post@@ p@@ one the other parts to the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle will be turned into a parallel h@@ olog@@ ram . you can launch this module about transform@@ ers .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and display the new dimensions of the target image to the right of the thumb@@ nails .
your help will be vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of one building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the switching tool to adjust your image .
after having performed the she@@ aring , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots produced twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing .
&amp; Check ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write tables . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ lied with . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all files available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F under them .
&amp; Check ; shows only files in formats that knows . this will happen on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the picture editing . you can change this list of file exten@@ ders , which change . in the section configuration you will find further information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select even the used format . a ful@@ ler description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smooth results than JP@@ EG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save los@@ sy when it is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw material , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert the raw material pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ ani converter . in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised ; .
&amp; Check ; support the charging of Roh@@ ts supported only with the program d@@ cra@@ b which has been included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of Roh@@ formats supported by &amp; digi@@ tised :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; however , it does not understand film processing program and therefore does not have a film @-@ editing program and therefore does not have a video file to display or edit . if you click on a movie file and checking out ; the settings to play movies to start the program to play .

( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left side shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected preview .
vertically split . the left side shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to over@@ - and sub @-@ exposure . the colours used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and disc@@ ard it on the part of the picture from which you can preview . the preview to the left part of the dialogue will be immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ tion from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties displays essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originates from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press it out on the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , set off your images Geo @-@ data included .
&amp; c@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit colour pal@@ et@@ les and to check and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either apply to the whole system or only one operator . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; kiss ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can choose from a list of the p@@ allets , or browse the files for files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to pick out . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to the cursor . subsequently , move the mouse with tra@@ ded lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the coll@@ ar plate is activated in the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected to write . this mode , you can set by selecting the coll@@ ar @-@ field below by@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and inser@@ ting .
&amp; c@@ color@@ edit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ line character , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; c@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the color @-@ click on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; is a KDE program for viewing by &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene . graph@@ ene programs are free layout programs . graph@@ ene programs are free layout programs . graph@@ ene used to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs , the &amp; graphic ; includes , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ en@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; b viewer : -@@ project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; is a KDE programme to view the viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene . the graphs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; box ; programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graphs re @-@ expects and co@@ graph@@ ed ; ) )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graph@@ ene in &amp; kiss ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
load of large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to present more than this no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; is a &amp; b ; -@@ program that requires the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ ene required . needs to be required in detail :
the main window shows the open graph , each in an own sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; col@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list re@@ fin@@ alized files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is shown in the corner when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the wheel wheel ( high and down without any special , left and right at sup@@ pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has been changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; may your decision also be noted , so that later it is going to change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings box ; use ... see also .
if you open a Graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i outside a current &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance opening up , or on the command line , you have the choice to open whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; for instance , or want to represent the graph@@ ing graph@@ ene in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the program start you can open all graph@@ ene of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later .
you can also define how the Grap@@ h is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be adjusted to a page , then the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages shared graphs without head@@ line and with another font .
the page again loading the opportunity to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , and eg . from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of a graphic viewer . you can set a standard behaviour for this case ( the graphs in a new window open or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site administration gives the option to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) or dict@@ ate , in each start to be asked .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphic ; Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the default for targeted graphs . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few can@@ ten@@ ders as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . he produces depic@@ tion according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimension@@ ally sc@@ aling sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spr@@ ink@@ le graph@@ ene a spr@@ ing@@ board layout . it uses the fru@@ ity Rein@@ gold pi@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ wheel@@ er for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the knot@@ s circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ cli@@ c structures .
opens a dialogue in which you can indicate a layer command , which is then run by a shell , and the comp@@ uted layout of the graphs to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format can give you &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms allow specific options , or even the graphs with a filter to change before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read and store new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner that is supported by the SA@@ NE project or other source such as video streams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
if you scan the menu images , a dialog appears that you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the picture here . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to select your image appropriately , to select your image accordingly . see the video preview and adjust the area to your needs , before reading with the button scanning the picture . the estimated file size is displayed on the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings otherwise may not be displayed .
after you have pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until scan completed and the window will specify the type of image file . here you can also choose the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; choose or create the image saved .
screen photos can you generate after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ tion@@ - &gt; screen@@ shot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work space , to read a single window under the mouse .
if you select your own program window , the call @-@ up program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have chosen the complete working surface area , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long the screen@@ shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image to add and edit . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the picture and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available to loc@@ alise images geograph@@ ically in sp@@ her@@ ical coordination system , used by GPS and Galileo . altitude , length@@ wise and lati@@ tudes are used .
to cor@@ related your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
Bild Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above mentioned dialog appears then . in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , this file contains of course data included in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation is carried out by the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera process needs to be revers@@ ed with the time zone . this can be done with time zone . place your camera zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS period and camera results . however , the devi@@ ation below is combined with the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one location for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate dates . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a large period difference between camera and GPS lies , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pin .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog coordinates from a call to the next , you only have to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found and placed in the map and enlarge it . select the respective region and enlarge it . the height can always be selected manually , the height can always be selected manually . the card can switch between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums on the right . you can quickly select a large number of albums on your right . in the area below , the show @-@ look and the text of the HTML page will appear in the header page .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely explained for each image . if you then click on a picture , a new page is displayed in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture is shown directly with your default picture , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider &apos;s album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have written permission . a sub@@ folder called K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ 5 , which contains everything it will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color @-@ depth , you can change the standard color @-@ colored . the settings naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allows you to show some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails which are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Ab@@ break for breaking the process .
if the module produced the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore start the programs to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press Connect to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Illustr@@ ator is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Illustr@@ ator allows to look at a selection of pictures and run on them basic operations like rotating , zo@@ oming or distor@@ ting . the viewer is du@@ ly using short images and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss loss module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JP@@ EG format without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color @-@ formations occurs . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format again .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera cli@@ ent is a tool to enable you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera module currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function in the main program and then call on the import function . this will then open the file dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data is copied after you hit the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported while writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module also uses the packages of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Sli@@ deshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slide bar . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ CD / SV@@ CD / CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images packed into MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then covered in image files in the portfolio . here you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that is shown a picture . the speed of the picture process will be defined . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as possible as possible .
if you specify an audio file below the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you adjust all settings to your liking , you can now go back with the button code . depending on the speed of your machine , you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a coffee while you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right bottom .
the printer assistant allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with imaging Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance your or use the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your data stored in one of three formats of JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM respectively .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original district of Him is : expect you from d@@ cra@@ w not that there are the same results as the software developed by your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get cra@@ b better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image window window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now rev@@ ise the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option is to use the camera settings for the white sand . the key parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG Con@@ version can be selected so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the enhancement is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a loss of loss and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free LZ@@ W compression .
in case you are planning to deal with your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JP@@ EG format since it allows only a limited number of operations before the picture quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ adata that contain in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start installing the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can break off .
the stack @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier trial . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can reduce the image or enlarge . four types of images are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , chosen . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is subject to change in this option .
printing preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected photos with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the previous images before . further pictures can draw on the list of images to be drawn up and disc@@ ard it .
after you have started the module , the images -@@ window with the images you have selected will be displayed . you can add more pictures to the button below . for the last displayed picture , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and put it there in order to add to the list of images to be used .
with the icon images , the selected photos will be removed from the list of images to be found .
once you have selected all pictures you can OK with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are attached already as app@@ endi@@ x .
be sure to send out too many pictures on one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and each time is used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are put together in a text file and the mail was laid .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted among loss free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG below images file format and are the original files in JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the missing images .
if the process is ready , the window will not automatically closed the status of status , in search of errors , can be seen automatically . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button s@@ lic@@ t you can sh@@ lie this window ?
after Star@@ ted of the module of Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to have your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation use very elegant image transmission through OpenGL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , because otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an End@@ los@@ s@@ loop . you can then manually break up with Es@@ c .
the option pictures randomly select is that the images are shown in random order . so it will not be used to order the pictures in the album .
under delays between images can be the temporary distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should have fun before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions , between which you can choose . by chance you choose another effect in every transition between images .
during Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ se currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background to your KDE work@@ flow .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can watch with &amp; c@@ photographs ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries for viewing after EX@@ IF based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for themselves .
if you press the mouse to the entry people , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by some thousand images on some single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your host .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before their name . you can store with &amp; c@@ photographs ; however , for each person you can save his own pre @-@ image , this is of course also available for places , keywords , and other categories that you have self defined . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button , which is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that if you choose to apply for the current category . please note that if you choose to adjust for each category you can see for example symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must determine which image is to be displayed for each individual person . here you can open the image An@@ sich@@ ts window ( in detail ) and select in the context menu the entry categories editor . here you can choose the picture for the appropriate person . in the An@@ sich@@ ord window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialogue for the feast of the picture qualities . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of images are searched for this text . if you want you can also enter a date , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photographs ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photographs ; and check out the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; box album ; and choose in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; box album ; for the first time , or select in the menu for the menu item record ; -@@ demo start . then , some example images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; box album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photographs ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of the main window ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of these sign@@ posts you can see here : . as the name suggests , this Le@@ iste displays you data statistics about the pictures in your base .
the tim@@ eline can display several different periods of time . each listing shows then another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the Le@@ iste only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline you can use on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview video ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button depressed and the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the time information , draw . if you select a range , you will only click images of this time@@ frame . you can select the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar .
&amp; Sp@@ photographed album , puts you two possibilities available to create HTML @-@ websites with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; conc@@ ub@@ by ; described in the following part of the user guide ; integrated version which you can create about the HTML File menu .
before HTML pages are created you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , every area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the stream and a description that the HTML file should contain later . at the photographs ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; box album ; export file is to be seen on the lookout page . nutritional information on the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information displayed on the HTML pages will be displayed . so , you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer is obvious . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . note that all pictures are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images before specific considerations .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically made to them .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . this way , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can be downloaded for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , place the different folder and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to choose for all your HTML files , and for every subsequent set , select a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible for viewers . if you have created your URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages you have created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will be launched in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files provided by you are not in the final target folder , you need to copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three to base folders or URLs , in which a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder .
if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; B photographs ; however , you may want to create a HTML @-@ page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already applied a lot of time for considering the pictures , location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; sp@@ lin@@ album ; this work does not even make .
with &amp; Sp@@ photographed album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the Bil@@ is@@ sions are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored with in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images . the advantage includes all images together , and that file can be distributed as independent . however , the obvious downside is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in a double way . first , the images are not found , so the images are displayed in the URL , which you specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog for the export of images described you can call about the menu Ex@@ por@@ e ... call .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when you make manu@@ el near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photographs ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not use the files to comp@@ ress . if you would like this , simply select the option export file compressed .
the last option of this site is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with an extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ters ... , it is released , the exported database as described in .
the assistant to impor@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the images are to be copied .
it can be that you &apos;re called to the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called on your base . that &apos;s why you are asked in the third dialogue window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported , and which categories they correspond to your database .
the fourth step allows you to merge the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures and view : when you look at pictures you often want to look inside different picture groups and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this guide you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , above ( 2 ) the way to go through ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book it is spoken about pictures , but frequently this also closes the videos with one .
&amp; Point album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file which you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in CV@@ S , where they can .
&amp; album album ; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future start album . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start the photo album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
about the menu output settings , set up ... you will come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; box album . in the following section of the user guide , the different settings are explained .
the links you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings , preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed aid is available , which you can call through one button to the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can set up different properties for each image , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on view the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a medi@@ ator like in a group .
in view the settings that are available to you for the rest of the membership groups . with the above listed selection list , you can select the category which you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; album album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . nutritional information about this can be found on the site of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; Sp@@ photographed album , but are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
because the modules are shared between multiple applications each one with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with the demo database . this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo file , before you call it to your own pictures , demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t tell you , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; box album ; not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; conc@@ ub@@ by ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; c@@ photo album .
thereby sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photographed album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all pictures , which shows you at the moment at the moment .
apart from the current album &amp; album album , the modules also pass a list of albums at all . this works &amp; photographs ; as follows :
if &amp; box album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have defined in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category people will do , so do if you would have selected persons to view and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; box album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the field modules which modules are loaded .
in the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you start the photo album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE uses , you can see the window at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . in the section we don &apos;t have a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , now click on the entry pictures that shows you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photographs ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box by typ@@ ing people , places and keywords , these are a very important part of the photo album , as you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures inside the list : if for example , you have a family celebration and are listed on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and to arrange .
if you prefer to have a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected suggestions for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and provide those pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the images before and back buttons , which are located underneath the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multi@@ er entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California lie all over the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
the picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as an overview group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry in one category and disc@@ ard it in order to sort this sub@@ category of this item . caution , this requires that you can just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it here .
you can move the individual elements of the area of interest by clicking the Le@@ iste , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by setting it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the button Options ... , which offers you the option of storing the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also release a frame completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and here you can see window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will receive an overview with thumb@@ nail images of the currently selected photos , or of all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple .
when you make an image in the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it is displayed at the picture of the picture . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture panel , a new ad window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image gallery . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you would like to delete , and press either the Dele@@ te key or select in the Edit menu . now you can view the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; Sp@@ photographed album , offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures , without you saved on your hard disk . of course you have to record the pictures somewhere , so the photo album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; box album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper hand is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so you can display the thumb@@ nail pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image editor .
as you may see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it . so far , it does not support you to ask the inser@@ ting of the respective CD . if you would like to avoid ag@@ gra@@ vation as the mess Br@@ ing of your images , please purchase a larger disk , in order to save all pictures on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures that you want for other in@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also view all pictures that may see your little sister , asc@@ ending and choose the menu item all out of current view .
in order to set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to unlock the laptop with your little sister , simply select the pictures you have locked up . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be inserted to block the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture guard is by no means very safe . for one of them all pictures on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone who can read on the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml , can read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this kind of password protection serves only those who are familiar with &amp; c@@ tural album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; c@@ photographed album ; and of course you spend hours on hours with it is natural that you wish to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; photographs . this is why you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , then you can easily drag them with the mouse and disc@@ ard elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right click of the viewer . the right @-@ click menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and move back by using the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; box album ; then invites a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image by pressing the str@@ e button and Plus or minus press . started and hal@@ ted the slides through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; anec@@ dot@@ album ; it is in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can drag the image in and out zo@@ oming . at the minus button you can easily drag a rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse . the Plus button is zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the gender @-@ key sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel appears on the screen to a pixel screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and M@@ inu@@ x .
with the screen@@ functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can see an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch the image and enter the configuration dialog of the picture . however , you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark it as good or badly , while you see one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer provides the opportunity to provide images with features , while you see them . features are the letter A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view , you see an image where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set characteristics on your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you choose , so add one module to copy the images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be shown in the thumb@@ nail . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply selecting the letter to the characteristic after the picture was chosen . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you to paint &amp; photographs ; on the picture to paint .
the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can re@@ vert your gem@@ old later .
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted picture . to turn off the painting mode from the context menu ; just select the picture from the context menu . to quit the picture , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ell@@ eler ; you need to work out the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation regarding &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the lenses and display the object in the wire @-@ file views .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following folding menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the correct position :
with er@@ asing either from the menu bar or from the right @-@ click menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click on the user to adopt these changes . have the invali@@ d values indicated , then you can correct the editing mistake and again click on the user or the changes with abor@@ tions .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by calling .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ al view .
press the thumb@@ nail in her own view and a small example of the scene is made with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture is rounded , even if you want to choose a sub@@ ordinate element . if you only want a portion of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , add locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and spin as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual level as a wire level . you can indicate this value relatively to the Visi@@ bility level of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; it has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the lenses are left and the four graphic views on the right are shown .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different order , you can adjust it to you . you can also save several wind@@ ings and simply switch between different agen@@ das .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the top @-@ card top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to resolve a view out of the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click the little to the left top arrow in the coll@@ ar bar .
in order to close a view , click on the small cross in the coll@@ ar bar . to avoid the lock , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement . it is displayed a dialog , in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ame them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ell@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is released in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to capture the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ate the symbol Ren@@ ate in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full quality images .
if you click on the icon at The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View menu R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , however , useful is a name that leaves the characteristics of the mode .
in the car@@ part map size you can add the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to ren@@ ame only a small area of the image , select the cross section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality you can select the properties available &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering use . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rounded with only one beam pixels , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or stool @-@ effect effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details do not appear if they are in the representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is constantly being divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sively increases of the calculated color values .
when you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray of pixels . if the difference between the colour values to the preceding pixel , both pixels will be charged by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you adjust the depth of 4x4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between colors values the pre @-@ determined threshold , the pixels becomes divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be followed separately and on additional sub @-@ pixels . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set up with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of drugs for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch j@@ it@@ tering changes , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light@@ re@@ flexi@@ on . it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this property .
on this car@@ p map , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent if the associated rays made no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ ation . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly ends , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu item impor@@ ters ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command @-@ cat@@ cher of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or warnings occur , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Be@@ gin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can move objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to export objects in the text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ell@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ oun@@ ce . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the Fe@@ atur@@ al view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ell@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high @-@ ups ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you want files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also add the path to these files here . if a file is located in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type mark@@ er .
you can set the object catch the points on the button @-@ click menu of the wire model views . you can set the r@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values provide an accurate wire model , making a better approach for the objects shown , but require more time to Ren@@ ate . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the details level for two directions .
when you cross the High deta@@ illed for advanced projections , all the wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in better approach for projections , but requires more time to return .
when you display wall signals crossed a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you display bottom , a ground beneath the objects is removed . the ground is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you disable edge @-@ edge methods for ren@@ ders the scenes , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ oxid@@ ant method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can set you . more precise information about parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window arrangement or create new window arrangement . in the window arrangement rules , you can create and store window arrangement .
the default box standard @-@ window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangement . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list available window arrangement displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be added with the button add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window , with the new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor your window under the existing window , with car@@ tei@@ es you get a car@@ p view view along with the previous view and web@@ cast , view not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ell@@ eler ; and now you would like to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate however simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bul@@ let at one level .
but you should take the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
when you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ ders can be applied as a result you will receive a black image .
if you do not insert lighting sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have everything faul@@ tless installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ introduced window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols are now frequently used , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item to delete . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of view lenses in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is displayed later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on the box and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the button application or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree will immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a Qu@@ ader for example ( insert En@@ k body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an obvious method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simple possibility . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button User or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
now the wire model view now shows the level , albeit in the moment only as a limited end@@ setting . if you ren@@ ches the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you click on the icon for the ground if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you &apos;ll see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the properties .
in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the sky@@ line lines , so that you will get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
just select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases there is a dialogue where you can choose how the object is to be inserted . the pig@@ ment will then change in the object tree . you can view the name in Fe@@ atur@@ al view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment looks right now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a mat@@ ted black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest .
if you are looking for a color on the Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button user @-@ button only and then call for the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the color you expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ och@@ ro@@ e . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess@@ board list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree every time mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the lenses :
you should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can just as easily create as the ground :
in the view of the lenses you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button user ) , so the ball over the ground would float over the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit .
of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as already before , the pu@@ ffer appears like a mat@@ ted black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
when you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already at the ground , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as paint :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select then mon@@ och@@ ro@@ e and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the images below and click on the user button or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection results already in part good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not even selected is :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ ancy is a method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you play a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that reduces the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the r@@ ender is calculated , how this beam works through objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog influence . thus , the scene pixels for pixels edited .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a source of light , you also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene , which is to be removed , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard @-@ file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in the sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space .
puts the scene again in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
in this menu , you can only select if you haven &apos;t saved any other changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ al command . you can only select this menu , if you have used them back .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for hiring &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add or add new commands with this option ; commands or add new commands .
open a dialog to setup the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the commands with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to model rough finishes without having to model any bro@@ il on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue edited to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , by using a image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image editor and browser . the application features a file browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can preview with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you search for a specific file , simply type the first characters in the browser window . then a small input box appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five car@@ p cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short instructions for the ad window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the pictures are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can continue to set down . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option , saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; passing the name of the most recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the color color .
you can create &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; enabling only some of the file types to display the program can also display .
using this option for large images the display window will be enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
changing the span between the image changes at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders , or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is placed on 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it gets removed from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders , or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here are the short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cart @-@ maps short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystems ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the part @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short version .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short version .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short version .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed , if no Brow@@ ser@@ window is opened more .
display the image in its original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling code is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the file you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; b ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast video editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of the &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to it , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; it makes you feel as easy as possible to report bugs or wishes . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the guide to post your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project which is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user interface by &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can send your questions to other users by &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , it is spoken in English , you should therefore be mighty in this language .
the best start to join &amp; in photo ; it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to change as much control over his working procedures as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show@@ rooms . to display this settings , you have to switch to the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left hand side .
in the area of exposure @-@ indicators you can select the color that is shown when the sub@@ section or over@@ loaded indication should be selected . skill wise should be the colors with what you are supposed to show , in contrast . under@@ load should display a bright color and over@@ riding a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that will provide you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same page bar can be found in the picture editing . you can view this display in which you click on one of the five horse@@ men :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; an application to scan images that do not make more fun than scan and storing images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; a simple application to scan and save images that will not make more fun than images and save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display images before the image .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard sc@@ anners is specified , then a dialog for the selection of the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner device and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
to make a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for scanning . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to select the picture better , the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview fits in the window .
if the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you are selected to store a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a quarry and you will return to the main window .
through the button settings the same @-@ name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option Before store a preview is chosen . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option needs to be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog for storing for each image opens the dialog before each pic@@ tured picture . if &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically can save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the option for storing without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialogue for storing . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image fix for automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to store . the automatically saved image receives a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when an image is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality for storing images . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button On starts the KDE About @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and scar@@ let can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to quit .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; use like any other programs short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these short@@ cut and their function . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut in the player window and set up glob@@ ale keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and specify short instructions .
you may set up existing Multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; -@@ short commands function . this makes your keyboard on the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control centre .
the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ o@@ K has many general functions which are mostly used in other KDE programmes . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP feature could be a break &amp; z@@ b ;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; b ; . additionally , Amar@@ o@@ K has some own command @-@ lines options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of any missing dependence . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script is not running .
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE hy@@ ming for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the necessary functions . you will soon notice that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ o@@ K and Amar@@ o@@ K . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should be attached .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be inv@@ oked . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; sends noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . to this reason , str@@ ings are continuously monitored on the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore events if it has no use .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ K sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script should now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information to the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the pieces ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu one image , ab@@ uses the path to select the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be used . to remove the menu item d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) Al@@ co@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; stops , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. re@@ conditioning data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; z@@ b ; downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archiving name like this . such packages , for example , the user can detect the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ K script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sion amar@@ ok@@ Script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages just right .
the main script needs to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining on @-@ charging modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wiki script side of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; attached . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ , Skri@@ ll .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ o@@ K ; has many useful and powerful features , and is still surprisingly easy to use .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to install K@@ delicate packages ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; needed some of them to find for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instructions on how to compile K@@ delicate .
some features such as OS@@ D are anticip@@ ating that your window manager will function the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work hard for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ delicate and Q@@ t because they represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can look at the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the cap@@ ut@@ te file that causes the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib during reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is a little mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then results in collapse of the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you are using KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then turn off . switch off if in@@ active for ... to adjust the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ pack by email ( the e @-@ mail is automatically opened to a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and send us a good che@@ er , the bug will be guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Info which is not marked as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; If $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the icon at Gray 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check whether Amar@@ o@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ de version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so adjust that Amar@@ o@@ K will find the correct version first .
there are a few possibilities . most of the installation problems clarify the ligh@@ test by means of a team of your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ K .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please fill in there only one mistake , if something is due to the rec@@ ti@@ fying of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
in order to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate items , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column evaluation . you can also use the short instructions Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ K is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Dis@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from playlist from the folding menu .
drag a playlist files to the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to add the add @-@ button , the button is located in the playlist . click on it .
probably you &apos;re missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; new . take a look for li@@ b@@ x , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar , under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
yes , that really is true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in the default no MP3 deco@@ ders are delivered ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input box
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver using the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached simultaneously audio modules ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and help you find a solution . for go@@ amer you need to specify a different rope ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ally ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; already . don &apos;t forget that media is first to be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ c@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codi@@ fy the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend direct on al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server to be operated with highest priority ( real time , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed reproduction . read this error report . enlarge the sound pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less yields respond the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a fault , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . perform G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Up@@ loading your m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the module folder by G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you can find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; .
please report it from bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and allow the alarm to run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the play@@ back start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; runs before going to bed , then you will have awakened by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how can I get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; ongoing title if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ Ad@@ dress with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; window . press this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size changing windows .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button represents a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ le sequence into the queue . by pressing the input box , after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ led functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; to the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ K the collectors database can &apos;t be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ K on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ v MySQL support .
place the CD a , then click on audio CD to play . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading you change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in an Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ C@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT display counter , cre@@ ated@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has achieved every single assessment on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by clicking on a column @-@ button in the play@@ lists window . here you mark the evaluation of a piece , just like all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit it . you can edit the review also in a dialog met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means : KDE packages have a fixed publication plan not to bring together with the short @-@ set plan of Amar@@ o@@ K .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ K , which some users can certainly find annoying . disable the option symbol to play animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create an own one . install this then on Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to similar . to avoid difficulty , it was removed .
the navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; you can browse the quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 around the navigation area . then click the button Settings ( the top ) and select &quot; Add Amar@@ o@@ K &quot; menu .
audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ;
if you want to use al@@ sa , please the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have caused a lot of dra@@ ins and therefore also caused a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine will not compile this output modules . you have to configure and install and install .
well , I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output module still does not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that is installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files is installed . you must now install the package de@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . you must now install the pack@@ et de@@ vel . then you have to compile and install x@@ ine de@@ vel . then you have to re @-@ compile and install again .
I consider the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;s &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ase , which is incompatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ ics . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you are comp@@ iling Amar@@ o@@ K .
I get the error message is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad installed .
to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , it has to be installed in addition to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will get the bug There is no element to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok new .
I have a second sound card and use Al@@ sa . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
underneath settings Amar@@ ok . ... audio output type the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ x@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ ose 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ ose @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio a , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib take care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick with sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio @-@ edition with Arts will not be looked after . you may of course welcome this problem yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed advisor for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant who would like to update your collection or the assistant simply do not like , then this quick start @-@ guide should be an aid . with their help you will have set up your Amar@@ o@@ K ; in a few minutes you have set up .
creating a playlist is very simple . tap the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . tap something in the text box . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist , save it with the help of the button play@@ lists . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists . with a right click on a playlist , you will find different possibilities how the playlist should be loaded .
to play an audio CD , select your audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD @-@ pieces in the W@@ AV format . drag the W@@ AV files into the playlist and press the button play@@ back .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here different possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . also some additional packages will be listed , which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages over a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers , with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
in this chapter explains how all the features of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K are explained , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your A @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control centre . at the top of the window there is a run @-@ text display that re@@ produces the current current piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit@@ rate and sample pieces of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of already exp@@ ired play time to the remaining play@@ time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , also under the disk image . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running @-@ text display also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q is used for setting up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the reproduction buttons , the volume regulation and the piece of position shooting . use the sli@@ ders to stop the play position or volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 preference , from classical to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create their own preference .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer view ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer field , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions which are available in no other player . but let you not sc@@ are away from the abundance of functions they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be inserted in two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , the playlist itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows are later added to detail . they provide information on the current piece on different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; perhaps you may be noticed that the sub@@ window start out there . the information presented here are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; moreover , the information collected in the statistics window can be collected ( ex@@ tras ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first part in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title you can see the album image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to tracing the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information on the current piece . they see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , the cover images may have in the same folder as the current piece . file formats can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name will be treated . the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set out which information in the music window will be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and choose from the context menu .

group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first to the genre , and below the performer .
group@@ ing genre / performer / album - This setting works just as the above , but still sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine the group@@ ing completely according to Bel@@ i@@ eben .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; your collection will automatically detect when you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar you can find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the complete overview . information about the use of this filter can be found in the section on this manual in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different periods of time starting from the last 24 hours to a year . of course you can also select your overall collection , which makes the filter practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
download - This le@@ es the current playlist and includes the selected pieces in the currently valid order in play@@ back .
attach to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
lines in queue - this function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
as playlist ... - save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
to media player , filling the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / On CD - Dad@@ a@@ quired with the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a dat@@ or or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
edit met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) To move files into the du@@ st@@ bin ... - opens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
up@@ lifting track record - changes as a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer shown among different interpre@@ ters but again under the performer .
the playlist browser shapes the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligence play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which has never been played .
even self created intelligence play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top list of the Media Player @-@ Brow@@ sers .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list . if you &apos;re done , click over . thus , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . if the transmission is finished , finish off &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; and redeem the tre@@ ad@@ mill for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in file list all the files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file &apos;s browser there is an address bar where you can pick music from an integrated URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z input and input box , you can move to music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window square , the hanging of files can be tricky by simple folding . in the case , the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : this will be inserted into the mouse button at the end of the list , and not at the Mau@@ le position .
the playlist stops all of you to play . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries into the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces are included . in order to reset the filter , press the filter so long the return bar , until the text box is again empty .
if you enter through spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that one or two or three are included ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for orders , the spaces are included , then include the search term with ge@@ ther : Mike Old@@ field . this way , after entries are sought to include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search point , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th . this looks for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something search for pieces , which does not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ ap@@ shots according to Bel@@ i@@ eben . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment .
you can set the play@@ en@@ sequence of entries by clicking the Str@@ g button , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you can add the button add to which you can add the playlist pieces . on the right next , you will also find playlist , empty and random M@@ ish .
next , the buttons follow back and Rest@@ ore . in this way , you can re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar menu is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can display in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example re @-@ output controls and volume controllers . you can set up the buttons by clicking on menu and set up the tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the overall play@@ time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and play@@ time is displayed simply by clicking the mouse twice in the appropriate display area .
you can also scroll up the status bar . to disable the status bar display in the general settings .
the context menu will be accessed by a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu . above this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ;
one click on this entry will open the window of visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ;
the Cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can launch them by selecting actions cover @-@ administration in the collection browser .
the Cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose which to display in the cover administration . choose from :
the queu@@ es administration received your great deal in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the pieces will play : 1 will first play , 2 as a second , and so on .
the administration of queue will open you via ex@@ tras . if you want to add a queue a piece , select the piece in the playlist and then click on + . you can also use the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the sequence of pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to set up those follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random sticks from your whole collection and adds further random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load @-@ load profile to make this dynamic playlist .
just click on the desired playlist , drag it into the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then choose . in this way your current playlist is replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist under your circumstances !
the two pre @-@ introduced modes re@@ fill your playlist and you can start play@@ back directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces begins with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended items are added each to the next piece @-@ change , so your playlist is only filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will be your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be de@@ activated once again .
the button New fill le@@ es the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist files open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . subsequently , the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist settings .
here you enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist is continually growing , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will no longer hear it in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are removed while paying ges@@ tures .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to a playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog you can already select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you add multiple play@@ lists , it will be added &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the crossed playlist .
some scripts allow own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; scripts , by installing on the script . once you install the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button more scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script anymore , you can delete it . simply select the script to be installed and then un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please look for writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins will be used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use plug @-@ in , just activate the cross@@ bar next to the name .
this quick guide should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to trace the steps you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can choose which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , keep in mind that you can get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
this quick guide should show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to trace the steps , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and you have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copying your data CD , please select ex@@ tras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to be burning .
after you have made all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialogue between the so and looks like this :

norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for the volume of the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and MP3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different chan@@ ts can lead the different albums of the various albums to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces will be reproduced differently according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s Dialog Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open @-@ opening projects . this is the same as if you were calling for every single project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project changes and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what happen to happen . you can then dis@@ closing between storing and changes . furthermore , you can also break down and hold the project so open .
includes all open @-@ opening projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project is asked what to happen , just as if you were invited for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project is asked what to happen so as if you had called it .
when you access this entry , you can choose to select files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn . &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , der &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be consul@@ ted with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you merge files from a previous session into the current project . the data of the previous session will always be involved , even if this function is not used . it is more likely to be used for you to see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set aside &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature does not remove files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files back .
opens the CD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD which you then can burn later later . also , there is also the possibility of buying a CD instead of normal copying . you should prefer ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD instead of normal copying . besides , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD with the help of copying , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing of writing and incre@@ mental .

burn a previously er@@ ased DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressures of burning push button .
a DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialogue window appears commonly after reading a DVD in the index view , but can also be used all@@ ot@@ ted . it contains information about the video , enco@@ ding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the attached medium . this information is displayed in the index view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ ing of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small void is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switched off the folder view , or out . folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents have been activated , its contents displayed in the contents display . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locking and locking of the running or dig@@ ging of the medium .
folds the index view one or off . the ingredients allows to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
det@@ ects the copying list in the project view , or out . the copying list is a narro@@ wer range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the copying list has no real function , it looks very pretty and separates the project view clear from the remaining views .
this will open a dialogue window to change the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the keyboard order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . this allows the correct cre@@ denti@@ als to burning CD and DVDs . for this , system management rights are required , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on An@@ xi@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and for the maintenance of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; kis@@ ses ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ Interface is equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled by using a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are essential in functionality , so it is more of your taste and the type of your assignment is decisive , which of the accompanying programs you give the passing .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions to generate new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP Re@@ ference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b C@@ 3@@ b C@@ 3@@ b C@@ 3@@ b C@@ 3@@ b C@@ 3@@ b
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates an data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT cream ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der able / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT C@@ co@@ p / home / extru@@ ded / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the Encoder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface provided by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ Free compression ) will have to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed in the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step is to be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ ed ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely to be installed to compile something yourself . however , if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- C@@ file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction about co@@ ding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word on copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware version of the CD ; / DVD equipment is not intended to handle any copying file ; in any case , it is not possible to avoid any copying recording ; avoid simply buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while inser@@ ting only must be done ( the setup dialog but can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , will be explained after daily handling of a &amp; CD ; to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ves programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can / CD ; get information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can completely work without network , while everything is manually captured .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step further information , how this program is used , and display images with descriptions of tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD@@ DB data according to the installation of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet must first be established . )
start the read and - if a Encoder has been configured in the edit code settings in the furniture catalogue - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available en@@ coder , so that the choice can be read with another Encoder as the standard . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured in the template settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already borrowed file is selected to codi@@ fying instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and de @-@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programs ( such as read the &amp; CD ) .
opens the main activ@@ ating dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different car@@ p cards ( as en@@ coder , to the setup of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co @-@ enco@@ ders and compres@@ sive rates and helps you with the right co@@ worker .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and few available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information is lost due to data compressed depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG might have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers will produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions free but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG equipment is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo plants . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio @-@ quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most pieces of music acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compres@@ sive rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex pieces of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more and 256 c@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music by teenagers , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ystem . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo plants .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or replaced by the program from the free@@ DB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files .
in connection with code programmes , there are frequently a combination of programs for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters . the manual or the help to Ko@@ di@@ ans explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : to read on a free database in which people can download audio CDs instead of publishing information instead of text : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( Note ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music business can be added . all information can be done in case of a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; an active object to choose ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address as well as in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used by the server ( This may only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , geograph@@ ically it is needed to be used in the nearest mirror @-@ server . this provides bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ r@@ vers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which le@@ les@@ bian program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that are used to cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more precisely in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to consider that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution needs to be installed first , if this has not yet happened .
for storing the borrowed W@@ AV files the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; console ) . in doing so , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; needs to be replaced by the name of the code .
this can have many causes . check the installation of device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading disk , and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; use &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 K@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords .
you need to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which of course you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have a write on it ( eg . by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that may be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each inclusive &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ding co@@ ves for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) and which structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program with that to use the free@@ DB data to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any read of a &amp; CD ; change when the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the read @-@ reading programme so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the true device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , the effective device @-@ drawing can be accessed , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ lange and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the mapping card of General settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything is shown / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only with incomplete information can be requested , so that you will be informed if data is missing to the witness of keywords ( tags ) .
the car@@ tei@@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily modified and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , further note : if you want to enter everything manually , then disable the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . to use free@@ DB in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following cart card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it all as it is shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the Mo@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server nearby . however , on this path the load between the machines will be distributed . however , this attitude will work as the first attempt .
both work equi@@ vocal on the server , as many fire@@ walls will drill the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surfing the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; out after reading the last piece : cru@@ ising this to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this cross , then the path / folder can be specified in which the W@@ AV files are stored . this field is not crossed , if only space on a different drive is provided . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
everything as input as it is in the screen@@ shot . the command is a little long , under circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is average approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of W@@ AV files at the same time : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ rant or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than one W@@ AV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; ended . this configuration is being used as a standard for any read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is stored on the hard disk , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to collect . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each remote &amp; CD ;
as we use a &amp; CD ; use the screen photos a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully removed from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn to manually insert the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than pick them out of the internet . comments are indicated in the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD has to be put into the drive , which was defined in the main window , be ins@@ ulated .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; be identified and could be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the free@@ DB could be picked up successfully , all the songs of the pieces are already filled out and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be entered , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the cross @-@ field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot : the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data on the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; updating title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ac per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( for example if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary sector . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field @-@ length ; at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the &quot; tab settings &quot; tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ans and / or file formats . see the code as a code to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which is obvious to the style of the displayed CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do the &amp; CD ; data anyway does not transmit ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are among rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album have already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you typ@@ ed all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted in any of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the part list .
note that there is a check @-@ mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece , or pressing the button you select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button Select from the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons on tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example here . did you check if you have a writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is unclear . however , the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem during con@@ current reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
if you &apos;re talking to CV@@ S ; CV@@ S known as part of the collector &apos;s package , however , you can download an anonymous copy there . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in pre @-@ compiled package . most distri@@ butions are already included in pre @-@ compiled package . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons who compile data files , and not for users who use an pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs when it runs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different other programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different car@@ p maps of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the way for the first time , without any clue as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts not an audio CD ; on drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s what this is about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is thought it should be something useful to add or change , may it do . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has loaded this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if it has done you the source file from the &amp; b ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ ok@@ ers of &amp; kis@@ ses ; in addition to others he has not got some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; b ; it also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ tic@@ ulture project drivers , which is required for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is involved once there is a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the sup@@ pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move to &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you stop &amp; kiss ; during the play@@ back of a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also let a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and bed the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece , or to@@ iling the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically , once you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays out , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that a song gets too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and so change the recording speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played out , a pressure on the space bar like a print on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , thus break the play@@ back . bed the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use textiles , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be represented , and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ yp is automatically determined to activate a song . so if you choose to activate the entry Autom@@ atic text list , you will automatically have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set a Ere@@ id type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or rec@@ itals . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ise . these will be played in series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to attach a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find here in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the same songs as the original songs .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the shelf manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concerns the if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button add @-@ in , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and maintained . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Dele@@ te .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence according to the menu item , the songs are played in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button dart right .
to make a song back on the other hand , select the button preceding pieces , the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the drawing collection and click the button Dele@@ te .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ compatible . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of Type Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of Type Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl@@ . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required terms for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ alization is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional M@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all notes that need this instrument to support the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . to do this , you carry the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so , if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun powder ) it takes over 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term Tum@@ el patch the patch is meant , with which every sound represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drums , pel@@ lets &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the tone means the sound height of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to form sounds on the Per@@ c@@ ce Canal . check out the key@@ maps included .
this section can be used to create some channels on others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , just make it the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion to have on a certain channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns :
n is the channel , which is shown on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will of course use the name for this channel . if you &apos;re using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , there will be always patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ c@@ ce patch on the Per@@ c@@ ce Canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der event will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this will be credited with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only then . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ imal values are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM is required to play a key@@ board that is a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find the menu with settings , point MIDI @-@ settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of cla@@ vi@@ ons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ ons , you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view , to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button is not green , but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the edge view has ( until now ) two different views to show the played notes . view in the menu settings under the point of edge view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , De@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all the files individually .
agree , backed &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
before you need to activate the setup automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to dec@@ eler@@ ate the play@@ back . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double on the LCD screen .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file , merely in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file only , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setup automatic add to the collection and the new ; file becomes added to the temporary collection . opening of files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ D . first , you just want to play the first file . so make sure to add the setup to your collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then unlock , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . to all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and test phrases .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge excitement when you send me a postcard from your residence or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want to send it ) before you want to contact me , as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; c@@ mid ; fully written in my spare time and by no one p@@ ayed money to get it . I therefore want to emphasize that I can only ask for it because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Pre@@ aching the bug that the pitch at A@@ we @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the A@@ we support , has Pet@@ ter Bie@@ ker , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notified or just a supportive email .
and of course , my thanks also includes all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , it can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his home page , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can trace the development , information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer , as sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had sound card , except that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; c@@ de ; e @-@ mail lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please review the site of The KDE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; Co@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . either , there is a window with the central view . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window , which is only displayed when information is to be restored in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category durable playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical recording . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups is copied to the current category and the play@@ back starts with the clicked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists may also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it by direct editing the XML configuration files , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category C@@ click , select from the menu view and next editing mode . by the cli@@ cking of a sub@@ group , the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the same with play@@ lists and choose either from the editing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without equal to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during start @-@ up and moving can be disabled by the Edi@@ ting ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player , the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during start does not need to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be disturbing during the end @-@ animation however the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the advertisement of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; in@@ quired &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ quired ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the source package by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL to be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache &apos;s size from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ amps @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ IME type 1 / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog file mapping of KDE .
the quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; starting in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . the stri@@ ped process is cr@@ p@@ player . if there is no error occurring , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus , a pre @-@ determined back@@ end for a certain M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this was obtained ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner must be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configuration of the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there you should be recognized , of which one selected code has to be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ linux extension must be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by KM@@ player for sources of different names . at the time of emergence of these documentation , this is dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source source , trace source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they begin to play with the play@@ lists of the playlist .
is there any indications as I can turn off my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is as user root after installing the device . however , it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slow , why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time to check the CPU .

l@@ atex ; : a professional writer application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be accessed on package &amp; textile live ; or &amp; device ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux operating system . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation disc should be included .
the &amp; D ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ ilers and are included on the rush ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for the documentation are considered . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the tile ; web site should be made .

&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the reproduction of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile , there is a simple problem search function ( for example ) : if you have noticed some mathematical environment . however , you may not save it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you can save it through the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic processing of environments is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to lock@@ out the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . l@@ atex ; change the submission of the document in the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ cut@@ est element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and watched by a click of the mouse .
if you create your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex files . once an DV@@ I ; file &#91; more remote file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font , and also other information like the font . there are many tools to view conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; -@@ files for various systems and sizes .
when using the data search , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the Editor has been shortened and once on an element in the DV@@ I ; source code was embro@@ i@@ dered . once a section is clicked on a section in the l@@ atex ; source code is clicked , becomes the corresponding place in the DV@@ I ; observer notes .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up by project project settings .
quick @-@ installation : the l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if no errors in the source code exists ) .
file growth : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file on the de@@ x@@ in@@ ations@@ â si@@ del@@ ines are de@@ activated on@@ - and there is no call by &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the rapid construction .
when selecting the mach@@ ining tool@@ bar , the three great selection boxes should be developed for the fast and complete common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick outline of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The objec@@ tion@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for submission are :
the selection field is for example of articles such as tags , fox , notes or references .
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection on a selection box ) .
while sending a quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . during &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works when the file is going to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand .
the last drop @-@ box with the name is used for defining the fon@@ ts . it can be set by the fon@@ ts for the main text , the joints . they are set . the following scriptures are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices are available for the preparation : 1 . the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document art and proof settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . if the fon@@ ts are fixed at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the above source code has to be entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code will be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu , or the quick@@ ening installation .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iler . &amp; b ; for the storage is automatically stored .
closing the comp@@ iler of the document , should be searched for the errors in the logging of errors . when using rapid construction should be started &amp; oc@@ ular ; it is not the case , the log should also be observed .
an environment ( English . environment is a text , which is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } can be assigned correctly .
changes are only within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the changes within a setting .
there are many possibilities to create the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ ant pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ t } : this command is for the cures and is long as long as he is closed down with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be illustrated with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source text with the l@@ atex ; sign @-@ speaking language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; b ;
once in assistant a bit of text was typ@@ ed , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better legi@@ bility of the document . to do this , there should be at least a quote , a few places in fat and spa pressure and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor using Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ E ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window needs to be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DV@@ I ; is an extensive file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ age ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - can then printed the document printed by file ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is properly adjusted ) .
the tool@@ bar set the transformation of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin into flag@@ ging other formats through the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar .
to search for the direct leap from the editor to the current position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . for this purpose only modern is to set up the settings ch@@ ile ... tools which are selected .
in order to exp@@ ire the provi@@ denti@@ al search , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text , and fell asleep . the jump to the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; observer is then processed .
with this feature in &amp; oc@@ ular , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding l@@ atex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; available and corresponding line . for this there must be set free ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as a text editor , set up ( settings oc@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
should when using quick @-@ installation of the &amp; DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator , there may be an error . if an error is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file inv@@ aders the error source in the source code . in the editor you can look at the errors in which the error appears . in order to consider the error message , the error must be clicked on the errors in the log and &amp; b ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the aforementioned options are :
when selecting le@@ eres document , a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document . for more information about this is included in the section .
business users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , must be either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; -@@ file created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of drawing up an existing document and selecting file template .
when creating a new document using the new file , some character chains can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables are set up in settings default ... settings can be set up .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering documents class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the following commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document , you can then use your own template instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . a simple way of creating a template should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and writing of many different types of text files ( including bal@@ l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for Kate ; can be done in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about Kate ; and his possibilities to learn should be attracted the manual too Kate . users of &amp; kiss ; you can start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; a command reference which can be accessed by the vehicle &apos;s help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may find an exhaustive description of nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with master@@ ed Str@@ g button , to rule the &amp; tex ; that means that by clicking \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ \ &apos; .
when drag@@ ging the text with engra@@ ved lin@@ ker mouse , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , you can choose parts of the source code in the editing window .
&amp; C@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the most diverse types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants can boast one &apos;s own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ ades are highlighted the jumps on the last or last spr@@ ing@@ board . this ski marks also highlighted the jump , so that in the first input of a sign it is automatically rest@@ ated .
this is probably one of the main aspects when contacting a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent possibilities for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source texts have been added . &amp; l@@ atex ; use always many environments and groups and therefore support their selection . under Edi@@ ting soles are the following commands contained in the text selection :
included a complete paragraph ( group of rows that included on both sides a blank line ) . this extended importance is not meant by a text containing the above mentioned tables , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only indic@@ ative thing in &amp; kiss ; therefore , that the paragrap@@ hs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current curr@@ ent@@ position . this selection also has an extended significance , since this command also l@@ atex ; commands with a valid star ( \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
for example of a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by Dr@@ um@@ ing the button Dis@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; kiss ; offers with own commands , for a faster mixing . under mach@@ ining , the following commands include as part of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of the soles of the paragraph .
it has already been noted that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore provides &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF other commands under mach@@ ining environment for easy work with l@@ atex ; .
with this command , go to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to prepare the environment .
with this command , drawing to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to end the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ round@@ ing } , will be sung to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many f@@ aded environment commands , quickly the outside view can be lost rapidly . this command slept the most recently paved environment , so that the wir@@ ing structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also includes special commands for l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . by editing Te@@ X group are a few important commands that meet from mach@@ ining .
this command leads to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the gra@@ zing brack@@ et .
this command will go to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the gra@@ zing brack@@ et .
if the cursor in front or behind the gra@@ zing brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is , becomes the other end of the group j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many disgu@@ ised groups @-@ brack@@ ets , quickly the outside group can soon be lost . this command slept the most recently paved group , so that the missing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups do not dis@@ miss .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; they are used for the pur@@ pose@@ ful implementation in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; used for two simple application characters . also for the termination of application the character is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and serves two neg@@ li@@ gible characters for l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic shut@@ down of double the characters can set up under the settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be eliminated .
many other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French can be used . there are also many other languages available .
while transi@@ tions from Shift ; input keys , the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is available , not only a poin@@ ter but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a table area , slept &amp; c@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a grace@@ fully rever@@ ting direction .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support . these can be added in settings , set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users open the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; amp ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the most important tab@@ ulator in the following line . although this tablet is not the scene @-@ hungry , added &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has already been completed , these are in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually , for l@@ atex ; ) still extended . there are three modes available for the automatic distor@@ tion . all of these modes can be set up for different working methods with settings ch@@ ile ...
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ round@@ ing } , automatically the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
in the Dr@@ et of the box , the last letter of the input is removed and allows for the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions can be followed by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping brands are included , so that an easy jump to these positions can be noted by means of the spr@@ ing@@ board , and the selected parameters can be upgraded .
below settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ hurry ; Ver@@ sions can be made to these lists . there are different ones for the list &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ hole of the general language used to be used .
the command mode is for the distor@@ tion of environments not normal . on the other hand , the environments are often used with ambient temperatures . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments to worship .
when you call the full @-@ user mode , the whole old + Shift key , the command to complete the environment is automatically frozen and it does not appear \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be completed in the easiest way and by wir@@ ing the input button .
since this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once again , realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is being frozen .
below settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ hurry ; remove all the settings for these lists . this mode uses the possible list of all @-@ time mode , for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of dra@@ ins , which can immediately be set up by default strings . the lists can be set up by settings cl@@ assy . as an example of a remote list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , where for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
is entered into the letter L by the letter L and the word processing mode , the Men@@ g + Alt blank button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character .
large legs are not helpful for the automatic distor@@ tion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ators are written more than once in a document . thus , it provides compensation ; the completion of all already written ones .
this mode can set up the settings default ... no hurry Ver@@ sions . here also the s@@ ell@@ ular value can be specified for the display of completion .
the full @-@ like files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the private home folder . mode is available for plantation , Dic@@ tion@@ ality ( lock@@ ers ) or tex .
the dialogue graphics are designed to cover graphics as simple as possible . to provide the basics of the foundations for graphic formats , the sections should be observed and observed .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for clear@@ ance and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF file can be re @-@ arranged , and then the pages are newly arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to watch the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all components are group@@ ed together in the categories to create comp@@ iling , converting and converting view .
for the comp@@ iler of the source text for viewers like &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be the short@@ list of the Alt ; 2 . then the DV@@ I ; file is converted to a HP file by old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; -@@ file into a PS file , and by old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command of the command , it is usually called a spect@@ ator after the comp@@ iler . should not be used in a brow@@ ned observer , each time a new window will open .

a complete refer@@ encing board for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â s de@@ void de@@ priv@@ ation . this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a certain form of format@@ ting . as it is a very large document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks .

here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project for several persons in a kind hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project @-@ Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and is used for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and expresses the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text .
nickname and attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on remarks .
in addition to an overview of your team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it may be an event created for the information to the team leader when something particular happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific occurs in the project . an example would be seen how much a person worked on it , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that will play a file to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project , etc .
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the addres@@ see list of selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see can be a team @-@ team or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i can be set up such guides .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
input notes is simple . it can be either the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in an commentary range followed by appropri@@ ations to be entered .
notes can be sent a definite member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with top name of the first nickname of the team leader , should be introduced into the departments and sub@@ project names , as stated in the following examples below .
nickname and roll names are independent of large or short @-@ term , but spaces for the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages , which supports D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will only talk about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be setup via settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be handled in one another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including auto@@ complete communication can be changed . the entries are :
large / low @-@ payment of tags : large / micro@@ payment of automatically included tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ spelling means , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / low @-@ payment of attributes : large / low @-@ payment of automatically created attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ spelling means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if hal@@ ogen , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this instantly after the level ; added .
optional tags automatically shut : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
starting and finish tag automatically update : when switched , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding code during installation .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . using the standard the default values can be restored .
standard string code : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other ways than using open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) , but this option here will be extended from the same in the projection screen if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . however , this attitude here will be extended from the same in the projection screen if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that with a power out@@ age or lap@@ se the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as the store of the file . even for not saved documents a backup regularly , according to the specified time , created .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a body @-@ setting ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views have come through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ reset @-@ line parameter .
the warning messages area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings through attacks by non @-@ queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be defined the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode . regarding the various modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible , which by clicking the struc@@ turing , to change the sol@@ dered action by clicking the structural tree .
in the area of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree can be automatically opened at editing and how deep in a change of structural tree should be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the area to the fixed of abbrevi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) which can be deployed in editing to large text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can apply for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ App@@ lications of the third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; using a plug @-@ ins must be stated :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not on a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refused the store . only tick @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store if this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the requested information is correct . select also if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug was completely re @-@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary @-@ built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was dis@@ continued , as well as support for the db@@ g Debug@@ ger . instead of this a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins .
currently , only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adjustable .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger Plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - UI :
a view where the content of arbitrary variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ hand Dock .
a view where all the brack@@ ets , with poin@@ ter numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin with , on de@@ bug needs . this action is by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP server to the server to submit a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger issue .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently introduced line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution happens before a debit card is started , the script starts with the request .
displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start using the script , without information about monitoring variables and the current poin@@ ter number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution runs further . if this happens , the execution begins once a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement at the script without entering into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement at the script , whereby if possible in functions and can be cleared .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next , as if there were the current ones .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or phrase can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ sized value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable , or set up a new value of variable .

this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help better become better .
document type Edi@@ ting pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to give support for markings and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car completion and no@@ dal trees ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS . tag folder contain two file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ ging tool , the text and instructions can fit faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details of the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ ing . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags , as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ ing enable a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations is outlined in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about yourself or nothing else .
the type of the tags is a script function . when it is used , att@@ r &gt; an argument to the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for conference class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for type meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Commons Attri@@ but@@ or and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags , describing how this attribute is to be shown , etc . this is a single element type element .
indicates the source used source for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and on the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for the achievement of the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ p @-@ method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name , which means the name of the current tags .
a tank @-@ tag group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can happen for one attribute of only once . it is a mere @-@ element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags inside a dialogue . this day can happen for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( eg for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be there for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is a only element type .
specify a list of elements that end one day . this item is a single element type .
all conference files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be gre@@ ased and closed correctly .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; Text &gt; to be replaced . this will not cause any leg , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the conference files , the tools dialogue at the top in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and audi@@ ted Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check takes place at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 meeting file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schem@@ atic . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP script is described ; the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; func@@ name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Be@@ ars D@@ T@@ D settings . this can be edited at des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one of a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D / / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ names .
an action can set up with settings options ... created . click New action to bring the same dialogue :
this action weigh@@ ted short@@ cut . with clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; using K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in detailed settings and in carrying out the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but this is not limited ) to change the document or input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start -@@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be stated . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ ard / my@@ riad / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting You Vari@@ able in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is uniqu@@ ely added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above included methods can accept a script from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default one . in the selection field input can be determined to send to standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually recommended only with this attitude .
according to the input , the output of the introduced application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types issue : normal output , submitted to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output written text should be specified by the value the selection panel issue is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure . select settings promotions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
simply complete all the necessary fields and add it to the suitable tool tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes , and you plan their use , enable you to process a dialog &apos; Day when available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
ignorance ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use it from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose your size to others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting kno@@ b as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ day in the current document will fit .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue using other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar or it should adjust this to better overview by some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog via settings tool@@ ing . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by making all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its tool@@ bar ( s ) loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might consider within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository show whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create a existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then , you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you , the second we treat here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the document HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html 1 = spotlight 2.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html Day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation is something like that :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc yourself = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level item = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Test@@ ing Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction = Ac@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own contents . there is no known fron@@ tier for the shaft winding ( except through reason ) m@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources are replaced .
the ingredient section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended for the design of the context @-@ context sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script can display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . for context aid the documentation would be directly indicated . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ acts List ) and the file lines .
a simple list of self @-@ rich context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not become rich , but proud to have worked in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the stored resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) and others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or other people . at different places there is an email menu , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in scripts .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as correctly and user @-@ fully prepared for publication , for what it needs a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can choose an exit . in the dialog New resource you need to pass out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking of OK the high load will be started .
the high @-@ load can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and scripts , can be started .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files will be necessary in the tag XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to automatically convert a D@@ T@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D charging and Conver@@ ting a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .

tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first get familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use of tool@@ ing over actions is all that is defined as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure tool@@ ing , promotions and patterns in the global tree that can then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ ing . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ ing with special promotions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the building views , the car@@ tei@@ re@@ ite with information and the tool@@ ing . please suggest you in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the car@@ tei@@ es with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , like closing the current , other or all car@@ p @-@ rated , re@@ charge , delete or re @-@ load the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document .
rec@@ las@@ hing in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , processing the tag under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , when the string , under the mouse cursor a file is referred .
at the top of the Edi@@ tors you are the tool@@ ing of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional acts as standard to which a set of tool@@ ing is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar are adapted to the new features and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ ing is really light . if they want to insert it simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which represents the day . now , they can enter the data for this just one day . if they want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with car@@ tei@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , sample positions , documents , attributes , and documentation designs .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the ste@@ ward of files in the project by using right mouse click . actions like Add , Dele@@ te , up@@ loading , or Dele@@ te of the files from the storage medium can be performed with the right @-@ click menu .
another way of finding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole site &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective user and templates , in projects , can only be used in the project . more to templates is available .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send using email .
in this view you can view the internal structure of an active document . through links to a element , the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of a element you will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other building views . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces may change . it can be adjusted to the content of all available attributes with just a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc for a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two body @-@ rated at the bottom of the window , about which useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this car@@ p @-@ rider displays information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document used and all changes to D@@ T@@ D are shown .
this car@@ p @-@ rider shows all the errors in the up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ ing are comprehen@@ sively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of tool@@ ing is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as un@@ zi@@ pped T@@ ar archive over &amp; b ; . if they get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , like any other secure and load !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to give a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; b ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; b ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for swift web development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor , the developers started trying to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a peculiar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up @-@ Language Editor would be ? well , this would make him an absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; kiss ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then there should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim to be de@@ tained , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; b ; developer &apos;s community is based on why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; b ; -@@ Sc@@ st is not only this everything possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; thus to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , allows web inv@@ aders to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program compres@@ sing them can expand them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand without getting to remember a scrip@@ ting language course . ( more about it they find in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and developed rapidly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way inter@@ connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta . the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information in the details of the details is : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta roll ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervis@@ es by Eric L@@ aff@@ ine sequ@@ encing @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project pre@@ condition , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts in inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board there , a special character to &amp; HTML ; statement , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting reference .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; notice that the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
unlock the block selection and select from . this allows you to select text messages with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script errors are out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window to or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education and turn on the problem of problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ er . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change a structural tree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the tool@@ column left of the main window . this column permits you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if it prints book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the proceeds of previous or neighbour@@ ly , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed by the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file . web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialogue on integrating files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project managed . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
invites a project @-@ tool@@ bar . these are stored in the project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . these actions only need to set the name . actions need to be added via tool@@ bar tool@@ ing , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens up a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ ing to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you or anyone else did and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / stri@@ pped the entities out of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful if the entities are going out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew it . if this global , and a spelling in the global KDE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are available in up@@ loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , the tag menu contains a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar den@@ ies if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins under the menu listed above are listed below . click activated . click on a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ tax@@ able mode for the current file . the list of available databases depends on the box ; download version .
choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D , by means of an external application .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some restrictions in the KDE library , the switching can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the car@@ p mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu contains an entry . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
turns the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influenced every application that use the HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
judge the behaviour of the Edi@@ tor@@ to@@ ers . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ ing , or which will change and change the sequences .
this should generate a help accordingly to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from the top down , as for example after filling the project called the whole directory @-@ structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . in entering Name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without space @-@ marks with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address that you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem to the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ ations you can download and change . if you want to change it . you have to proceed differently from ser@@ vers@@ atur@@ ized script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; ) Python , &amp; etc . ) .
if files are involved somewhere in the main folder of the project , if files are started somewhere in the root level of the project , if a project is started anew , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all files and folders inside the main folder and you can make an exact choice to be made .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project characteristics in the menu profiles in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( wild@@ card is possible ) , which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mental option on top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at opening the project . in any more information about project views can be read .
this can be selected by the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the button options . in the case , the de@@ bug is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles can be up@@ loaded , high @-@ profile profiles ( see in ) are set , as well as the display of a client @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , by displaying an own building view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub @-@ window event , one can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . events will be executed when a previously particular event occurs , like the sick@@ le of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior is currently not able to influence .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management gives access to files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , however , lack the entries open and open with ... within the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can select various profiles . the profile contains information about the location of high @-@ up files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be dra@@ fted to prevent removing the removal .
the password is kept in memory and forgot about program@@ ing . this possibility is useful if common high load files is needed and the rather unsafe password on the plate can not be found in question .
this will stop transmission or simply exit the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ profile profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server , to which files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
transfer protocol for high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs can choose .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . password is stored on the plate so it cannot be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text .
one project view is just a set of files and tool@@ ing . it can be done in a project many opinions , that is , by simple exchange views , various files and tool@@ ing can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ ing .
views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ ing Project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ ing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best using the menu tool@@ bar . use and add can be distingu@@ is@@ hable . adding tools to be added below in the section section of tool@@ ing tool .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set out either using the right @-@ click menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , it can be set out other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar which results in a dialogue where actions can be displayed on these or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context @-@ text to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , entries will be removed and action packed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ ing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ ing ... and set up settings options .. set .
templates are essentially document@@ et , code sni@@ p and files for short@@ cuts . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used in principle such as a nasty fil@@ es@@ ystem with advanced organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any of the existing folder into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , in about the limitations that you imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included designs have conditions for their use . please read the conditions performed at the beginning of each template prior to using .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ aries are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ site under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available .
documents can be written from any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in the forec@@ asting tree under global templates . see in for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted over again on a template , but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
design a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template save as local template ....
once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out the curtain @-@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with pulling and cast on the man@@ oeu@@ vre .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be applied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and cast , or inser@@ ting the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right or in the project files building on a folder on the right and secure website template . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global templates .
project templates enable a very expe@@ dient . you can give head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or connect them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when testing templates in projects very profound .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder in the template , click on the folder to select the right @-@ click menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is slo@@ ped as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes have cre@@ ed .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the stem folders . if a regular folder would be set in principle , except they would be explicitly activated . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder .
allows you to set up or read text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders and foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special he@@ aders and foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have the right @-@ click menu ( show the right mouse button ) to add a complete command collection to add folders or copy , and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and the second , the Edi@@ tor@@ window will divide into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ision of &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . to process &amp; PHP , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode functions exactly as the first , except that simultaneously changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ized . using F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the button pressure puts the active cursor from a window to the other , while the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization rate between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; view , one can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time period can be set . basically , the recommendation applies : a small span@@ iel for fast calcul@@ ator and a wide range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is possible . the documentation dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor , which is used to transform the hanging co@@ ding . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. key words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added below by drag the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords key@@ word ke@@ d@@ 2 on the content -@@ column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the drawing of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is as possible as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style setup by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is as described in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is beha@@ ved as usual . text can be used as usual . text can be inserted through a type of type , and can be deleted by means of taste or removal bar .
inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way over tool@@ ing , as in the source code editor , it &apos;s to note that the inser@@ ting tags before previously existing identical tags are not removed e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , any other surrounding anchor must be removed .
some tool@@ ing such as the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists may need to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; a tool for the examination of styles are possible . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ les@@ ions , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style results can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile them , need except &amp; b ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; b ;
simply set in a template , in a position in a string of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or x@@ ml file or at the current no@@ des . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , you can set brack@@ ets on a certain file and line number and will be activated later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame of a file name , with relative path to working folders con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , for example , a period file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , it is checked on a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace of the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules , defined by the name defined in the X@@ SL code file . x@@ s@@ l : checks to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools about comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had changed many changes while at the same time corrected it in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts trying together .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within this line . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps the setup had changed . that , the result of these changes was a small nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ atively window .
a function that made a lot of work was the verb@@ ose and run by folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way compound is fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the rest and merge complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if you are working together :
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve them with the possibilities of hypo@@ critical color monitors . if you often need to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle more if Yemen and the setup changes . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the type of animal work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file completely . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ ner@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ ner@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ ner@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
opening dialog allows the manual type of file names , the selection on the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a recently opened file from the box . opening dialog appears to specify your selection and displays them next time . you don &apos;t have to specify third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the distor@@ tion is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the other folders .
if combined , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file immediately . you can do this step later on store .
the setup @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will start immediately . in Open dialogue , you do not need to select files you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and cast off : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains such a similar effort . if you want to find out how similar to these features , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can easily copy , paste and then compare .
note : at present you can &apos;t pull nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the subject of text in a compar@@ ision window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and cast off text into another program as cutting and Past@@ ing ( instead of copying and Past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each word window is the info line . the info line from the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the index number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the line . then , a small b@@ ail@@ able window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see on the color that file differs . if both files differ , the default colour is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s next section ( lead ) well .
links next to the text there is the abstr@@ action column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programmers where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the proc@@ ession and in few , rare instances . )
the vertical line that divi@@ des the abstr@@ acts column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the poin@@ ter is activated , the line is shown to the broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparative edition ) also has a info line with the booklet issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; geography &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains through the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ inge to find the most detached / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find even remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the column is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted the color scheme for current area and each other on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes the automatic merge or by manual do not have any line left in the group ; then it is indicated in these lines of the text ; it is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; introduc@@ tions conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature around .
note : if you select the options to ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters .
this is mainly navig@@ ated with the image running and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the windows , you can use the arrows to the right , beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the sur@@ name column next to the vertical cap@@ side@@ bar can also be used for navigation .
in the Aug@@ abe@@ window you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between one and over@@ load mode . ( default , the inser@@ tion mode )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns will sync the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already described in paragraph and declared the edi@@ table window display ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ ward / Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it has to be considered conflict between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Copy -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and dis@@ locate the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
po@@ inters are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a poin@@ ter sign @-@ sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ ingen + Zei@@ len@@ vor@@ box \ \ r . K@@ wi@@ 3 keeps the drawing line of source files not with , therefore you should use &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ ars .
the options and the list of the last used files is automatically saved , and restored when the next start is restored . ( menu Con@@ stell@@ ations@@ - &gt; K@@ wi@@ 3 )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog presents also writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive script are shown . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be wi@@ ped out . on these systems the button @-@ settings is automatically an odd colour .
when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button , the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you express or return the input of the previous row will be automatically used for the next row .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which poin@@ ter type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system .
while the comparisons of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es any line . in this step white characters are not ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon string &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; in the end of a line , others only store a poin@@ ter sign , but as a white sign be treated . while connecting , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after still looking for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atic @-@ rout@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need it from time to time , then use better the functionality voters A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts resulting in numbers or comments when the options numbers ignore or ignor@@ ori@@ ze C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and through@@ s of mer@@ ging . see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merger .
when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further assurance .
adap@@ ts the language of user interface . you need to stop &amp; diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted global over the Control Center . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries the upper setting .
about the selection fields for co@@ ding appears a short note of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the co@@ ding is adjustable for each file individually , can be compared and assembled by different co@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not be able to function with your co@@ dec , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . with this option you can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to sup@@ press lines of changes in white characters in the text or review page . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options numbers ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . according to selecting A &amp; lt ; s ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ ed ; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second sur@@ est column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . you simply click the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window side by side , or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merger and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the final source file as pres@@ et name for output file . ( when this function is used to re@@ boot the file , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that correspond accurately to your needs . you can use this function e.g. to cut disturbing parts or correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the command of the command is given to the input command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated output line .
the thought behind this is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however an external program is needed , and most users want to program that not themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l are fully sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processor command to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This is therefore all characters in one line . \ \ 1 in the er@@ tification string , refers to the found text in the first gear pair . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generate character chains ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ $ / \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ ft@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ user \ \ \ &apos; \ _ BA@@ R _ user \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos;
while you are experimenting with dressed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ app@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for poin@@ ter . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hand is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; However , per@@ l requires some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and to merge . further operations only change the data , which sees the poin@@ ter @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the poin@@ ter process will see the version of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the proc@@ ession commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst event .
often , programmers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate that sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it really carry out ,
... deri@@ ve selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the comparisons and merge from individual files very similar . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three files are gathered together , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder was specified , it used &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not to merge it . to run it , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
during boarding the folder you will receive a small message window on current progress . if you break scanning the folder , only the files are listed , that were compared to that .
if the scan of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ...
each file and a folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can double @-@ click on the + / - click on the + / - click the arrow buttons , or by folding the arrows for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , folders and view all sub@@ directories that you can charge all folders and folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the inter@@ connec@@ tive action may not be automatically chosen . if it will run together , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the picture above , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their overall content is identical . then you have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant to its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y , which is only green , then yellow , and later when it is old , is red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target , if there exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the objective , if there exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( such as A folder and B ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that can &apos;t run together .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( such as A folder and B ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that can &apos;t run together .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the output copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folder are assembled and selecting the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsafe ) , then analyzed &amp; diff@@ usion : files are different , but the same date appears , then the exact date appears , but the date is identical .. if such errors will not be eliminated , the files can &apos;t run together .
during which collapse a file is processed after another . it status @-@ column signifies skill , when it coinci@@ de , and according to other noti@@ fications when something un@@ expec@@ tedly came up . if that comes together , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right .
if in the dialog dialog , the file comparable analysis is selected , K@@ wi@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ der , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for rede@@ em@@ ous conflicts is only displayed when three folders were compared or merged . )
you can combine either the selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connec@@ tive actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring it together .
please note : if you do not specified the target folder , then the three @-@ folder mode is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder , B is chosen as the destination and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options passing by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasantly surprises :
to run all entries : choose directory @-@ together / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types there still exist invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty items . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you run all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options transmis@@ sions , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting .
select sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then it opens up a composite window ( please note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you &apos;ll see some error messages that may help you to choose the cause of the problem . so , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed together .
if some entries have been individually circul@@ ated , this entries ( in the current session ) and brings them together at the later collapse of all entries . even if this has been ski@@ pped up or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries are once again brought together .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ wi@@ a set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree ; multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folder do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary @-@ tree ; it can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary @-@ tree ; it can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be submitted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a distor@@ ted point . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a file can be hidden as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on default .
with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
with links to folder : when the option is switched off , the links are turned out . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively . a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a fin@@ er loop , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text . ( insert an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder about a slow network , it may be faster , just change date and file size . however , this speed test will cost you a certain level of security . please use with caution . this option is default in default .
similar to the familiar date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they &apos;re equal to the same . for example , it can be useful when copying the chan@@ ger date . please use with caution . this option is un@@ folded in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals for connecting files are identical . also , the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain as it is assumed that the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file already exists with .@@ t@@ g extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal composite of individual files , not just the collap@@ sible folder . this option is switched on default .
normally , the folder @-@ together view is visible at the collapse of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option folder &amp; text window to switch main window in the window menu and switch off between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , you can connect a single file by double @-@ clicking . so once you save the result , the status file will be completed and the file will not be combined once you run the folder .
this status will be lost if you read the directory again : list menu : new to read
KDE supports network more transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archi@@ vs with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ ashed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder is shown . then a file is assumed as a link goal . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option in size . ) ( This is only possible in local files ) .
the main purpose of purpose is currently used as differences of observer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to launch K@@ sten@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ wi@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a cage file , the input file is a patch file in Uni@@ fied format . then , the input file must exist in the Uni@@ fied file . then , the names of the original files must exist . then it starts &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ wi@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or the con@@ cord of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( well , it is comp@@ are ) already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 points already pointed out that it can bring together like the program diff@@ 3 from the slide tool collection .
I use GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot that I looked at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or get it like that .
you have compiled the program from the sources and do not notify the correct Pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default , configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines de@@ file the next to each other , this res@@ is , but this is the case on the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is much effort to create extra a file format that might store this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process more quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c linear ; published and the text can not be er@@ ased . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors for the highlight of differences . even more si@@ pping would be confusing and lacking the purpose . use for this please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug@@ ging reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need free &amp; c@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ V@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .

KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system to be installed in the KDE . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nonetheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; b ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift key ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current curr@@ ent@@ position and replace the current mark@@ er .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current version you have to read and read the folder after changes to these options . )
only entries are shown to have the differences . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target directory contains these files , it is likely to be copied after that . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on selection of the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window is attached to the end of the selected group in result window ( if they are not already there ) . if the lines already exist , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in the default , this option is disabled . under@@ sho@@ ots in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ ature of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , to quit or move it . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces as well as the applications running on them . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and another .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other surfaces .
the context menu depends where the right mouse button is clicked , if applied on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , the right @-@ click menu has only set up the two entries . if however , the context and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on working space and loading . the commands bring the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appear only if applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appear only if applied to an application .
is this cross field marked , can window inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also shifted to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ space are shown .
cross @-@ crosses of this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual spaces are displayed . it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ figures , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space .
if this field is crossed , the background of every work@@ space is also displayed as a background in the &amp; c@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the blank spaces are displayed to allow the selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple justification with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and pix@@ map displays a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic can be known as P@@ ager applications in some other wind@@ ow@@ els ; wa@@ xed displays all virtual spaces in a horizontal line and vertically in a vertical row , which is very well suited for representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and enter the switch from the switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not have any spelling for the file , you have to register as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ ell fashion and assign a value . possible values are :

&amp; Be@@ ars ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can enlarge with &amp; kiss ; a portion of the screen , so as if you read the paper a magni@@ fier for the folding printer or the exact view of a photo . these documentation include a complete manual for the use of &amp; kis@@ ses ; be .
it is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you prefer , start a window as shown above . the main window of the screen . below , displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is displayed as magni@@ fying window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , it may be enlarged ; the area around the mouse cursor such as a movable floor . alternatively , you can create a select display area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection display mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you wish to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in enlarged window will be displayed , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that it may be , currently not yet able to detect the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the default box ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with arrow and mouse @-@ buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fier and move it with the arrows .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; use or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection panel remains firm and only the lower right @-@ hand corner is moving .
&amp; glue ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turning the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the update of the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
choose the post@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , means , high , very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; kiss ; automatically uses your inserted short command to store files , opening up a new window , prints , newcom@@ er ( with the button document re@@ charging in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ gers and supporters &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen@@ shot . you can use an area of the screen so as if you want to use a micro@@ scope to use the folding pressure in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from the research or artist to the Web@@ designer or visually handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse cursor is har@@ dened a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of any mouse @-@ click pains .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor is har@@ dened a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people to em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also cause pain that is related to your computer using your computer , should you seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
in order to make it even more clear : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; pain helps to arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the case of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic arm@@ aments , the result may be different for each of them .
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click out as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the smart script is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ itting the mouse button em@@ ulate . now move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse is executed . this way you can carry out the mouse with pressed mouse @-@ button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you quickly get used to it .
this time @-@ time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if intelligent it is switched on , the script becomes different ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is adjusted , the &amp; mou@@ se@@ tool ; after downloading the mouse button wait before it leaves the mouse @-@ button again , if there is no case for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow cycl@@ ed to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can later be changed .
when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time ; open the reaction time to shor@@ ten the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you down a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
this setting is marked , is set &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment this feature is only available under &amp; b ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
put all settings on the values set back when opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button user , the settings will be reset to the stand after the latest d@@ ashed of users .
the best use you &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; initially with preference . in particular , the intelligent ma@@ ins you should first have turned off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later be able to push the smart slide .
when you use the audi@@ ble click , it will be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or on positions in the browser window , which does not constitute a link , does not cause un@@ seas@@ oned reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse rests , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can clean only the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse ball . as that happens , from mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ ape you with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; if just a different date has been started . if in this case you use the intelligent exp@@ eller , this means that the mou@@ th@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; the operation cannot end more through the release of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this will be reset to the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor in another place .
solution : use mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . but do not park your mouse on a neutral area of the working surface , if you want to create a ke@@ ystro@@ phy . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are more secure . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor and menus and the cover @-@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intel@@ lect , but I do not manage to edit text .
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there will probably be some advice here :
use the intelligent moving not only if you &apos;re just starting to begin your mou@@ se@@ tool ; instead , mark the mouse button below and hold down the Shift key , while you move the mouse @-@ cursor to the other end of the text and enter the mouse @-@ button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is the mouse button pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent moving the different time begins . later you can use the intelligent exp@@ elling also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and loud@@ speaker and are furnished them correctly .
&amp; C@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ dened . this program was designed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the to@@ iling of the mouse were hurt .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ sta@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a target process begins before the mouse button is left . in this way can also drag the pulling and cast off with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program , with the mu@@ sty user to let their computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; bl@@ unt users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes screen@@ shot ) you enter the command that will be used later for the language issue of text . further details can be found in the description of the document .
on the second page you can choose the default text box . from the text box text you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can be edited naturally .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the wording of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can cover the list of wording using a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the wording of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ boards of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the propositions you want to listen to . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select from these propositions which are to be discussed again .
with the menu @-@ associated settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two car@@ p cards , voice output and settings , the side of Vor@@ ter@@ rier , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language version , enter the command to call the language @-@ generator . in the selection field below the input field , insert the character enco@@ ding , with the text to the language generator will be passed on .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types , to pass the text . select the cross field , if the text will be left untouched as standard input to the language generator .
if the cross field is not selected , the text is given as parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using as a language service as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings is available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d @-@ language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text box , you determine which action by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text box in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the gro@@ in for text @-@ selling text@@ books is triggered .
with the selection of instant , the chosen text box is spoken directly and added in addition to the memory memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text box is first entered only into the input field .
with the second selection panel provided by the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ ic book , you can specify whether the text @-@ fitting manual for the editing of the editing pane should be automatically saved .
by selecting text @-@ in @-@ book store , the book will be stored . if you have any changes , the text password @-@ book is not saved . select before saving , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text box should be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ rier contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording of words . in the main window next to the input field , k@@ mouth displays ; a selection field where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can select the dictionary currently used for wording .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to the order of the books or export them into a file . beneath the list , you can set the name and language for the dictionary available in the input field .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; box ; documentation is displayed . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by dis@@ counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; c@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and how this weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , quieter dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly built words automatically added to the dictionary , generate in the course of time a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ agen@@ das is divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are shown as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text box , you can change the text box or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text box , you can change only its name .
actions like new text passages or books to add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text table is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text table is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of the disk .
this menu item has been crossed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing window , directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the smar@@ ter left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu item is crossed , a narrow down list is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; cas@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu item is crossed , a postpon@@ ing track for text box books with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged by default over the editing window , directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the smar@@ ter left and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the language issue not properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the car@@ part map language . ( see setup dialog for language lear@@ ners to further details . )
festival is a language issue system from the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license permits it to use festival for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions further .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language issue is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option is to be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wave@@ file so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to send the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples :
( Cat - echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be switched on as standard input .
the voice output of the dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; b ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
to make use of the K@@ TT@@ SD language , which appears in the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; c@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; takes about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; So@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can &apos;t speak text by the computer . it is stored a list of pro@@ chen@@ er sets that can make users again new again .
note that &amp; So@@ mouth ; no language de@@ synthes@@ izer involves . on your computer you have to be installed a language de@@ synthes@@ izer .

if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the voice system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cart @-@ top rated to open this car@@ tei@@ card . here you can set some general options .
highlight this cross field to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts successfully , the car@@ tei@@ card orders is displayed and you can generate text orders and read it . see . remove the mark@@ er , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD and de@@ activated the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this cross field marks and t@@ t@@ sm@@ s appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as it is completed .
with the buttons in this row you can start text messages , stop , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; b ; read the cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file . you can also change the speaker for one order .
click on the user or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the cart card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the top @-@ card ri@@ ps and activate there langu@@ age@@ way ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . check first if there &apos;s . then select the text which is to be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ Pre@@ vious and other visible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; kis@@ ses ; , you can read in text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . select then the text which is to be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then , the speech should begin .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications it is embedded like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of the events which you specified . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up different types of messages , for example , allowing you to appear if in a IR@@ C channel a message appears , in which your nickname can be read . with &amp; c@@ els , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; b ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu @-@ entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filter for drawing chain composition provide a good opportunity to correct it . it is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news , the k@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box as it can be accepted as provided in most cases . read also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering , text will be edited before he will be sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to select false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and spokes@@ man or to avoid certain def@@ ici@@ encies of language ni@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other orders and keeps those orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resumed .
warnings have the next priority . this step is important news such as &amp; eg . processor becomes too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after the edition of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; c@@ mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; kiss ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text messages . each order you need from the Car@@ tei@@ es orders is a text job . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text messages . text calls are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency .
all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reads , this edition is stopped and finished .
first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the visu@@ alized parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; convert from one format to another format . included in the scope of space ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with speaker connectors , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or subject to the program , which send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text of KDE news about it .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not apply , he does not specify the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a box ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters made in the page below . processing through the filters takes place in the sequence in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be deduc@@ ted from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter and it will be displayed on the following setup di@@ alogs .
if you have to insert a list of words or regular expressions , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter your filter a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character chains in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column . the list is displayed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete it . download a list of a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker is referred to as a text listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is listed here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID @-@ running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must you leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only copy of copy .
the filter chain is applied to the text only if all conditions apply to a box in the cast@@ or filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared with words the string chain filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) both sides .
in this guide you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; b ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ im@@ prints can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , also extends x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spre@@ e filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the car@@ part of the speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that texts from k@@ mail to be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; Book ; a text on the filter is handed over , it looks a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker attributes , which sets the program according to the speaker . the speaker is selected by speaker . with the speaker connectors , you can re@@ write the selected speaker .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the numer@@ ical expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; b ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Select , you can access this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , you start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the person you wished . if the text selected the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the right to show the dialog speaker .
use these buttons to save or load your spokes@@ person or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply to a box in cast@@ or filter if they apply . you need to enter at least one condition .
the language issue API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language used to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that you can use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the box ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and choose a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; con@@ sole ; window . start first in one window , then t@@ t@@ sm@@ s in the other .
none of the mentioned lingu@@ ists support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Per@@ former@@ filters set up , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you will need to do it even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will be installed and used over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause mistakes in synthes@@ izer , so that whole phrases are ski@@ pped or just che@@ der@@ hole . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option string code is set to the right value for the appropriate language . is there any problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string chain filter . see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for languages . if you want to bro@@ aden &amp; table ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ converting filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile it , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of a delicate and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source texts by &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source text@@ archive or have downloaded the Tar@@ ball for any night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is properly working with your language @-@ synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script remot@@ ely .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed that the establishment of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text will be dis@@ semb@@ led into single phrases . the user can with@@ hold sat@@ z@@ - or bar@@ red @-@ tw@@ ise , repeat the output or break off .
if an application transl@@ ates text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request a female English speaker . if you choose a spokes@@ man whose language is English and whose gender is female , this one is automatically chosen the most suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man chooses to see in after .
if you click on the cart card to add or click on Edit , a speaker can be displayed in the list or click on Edit , the cardboard card holder is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in general , the settings are made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , set up volume , travel speed and pitch @-@ height of synthetic langu@@ age@@ . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and displayed this grey , the voice you choose not to make these settings .
some votes such as multi @-@ Sy@@ n votes will need several seconds due to their size . if you mark this cross field , these voices are already loaded to the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( in a large storage consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this cross field cannot be selected , you have not yet established a spokes@@ man ( or just click on the user ) .
if this cross field is marked , it will be displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the window section . otherwise , after the start , only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this cross field marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s still does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the option to read or use it otherwise .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight set sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the car@@ et@@ card speakers .
with the buttons in this row you can select a tw@@ ater on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or going back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes in settings ( including the other car@@ p cards ) taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the car@@ p card audio . see also .
here , only text messages are performed and managed . expenses of screen readers , al@@ arms and messages are not shown . further information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries may not load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have Al@@ sa selected , select the PC@@ M device .
provide the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equivalent to half a and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal speech speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click user to adopt the new settings for the running &amp; the system ;
the list of all@@ sa devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this car@@ p map , you can set up specific actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and holds this orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders will be resumed .
warnings have the next priority . this step is important news such as &amp; eg . processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read , just a long text on a website , you can see &amp; c@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played out if a normal text @-@ contract is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message will be active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this cart card are only valid for normal text messages . for messages , warnings and spending of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ noti@@ fy messages can be read , start t@@ t@@ sm@@ s and click on notification . the car@@ part card aler@@ ts appear .
highlight this cross@@ roads to turn off the pre @-@ read of &amp; che@@ que ; this setting is not marked , the rest of the settings are disabled and c@@ un@@ ts ; reads no aler@@ ts before .
is this setting marked , are aler@@ ts when a sound is played off , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or to delete it . if you click the button add , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentions your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing different , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &apos;s happening ; do if an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following lists :
you can enter here the features of the desired person . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that will be displayed on the list on the list of the top list as top @-@ page entry .
note that there are three levels for events . is set out for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last possibility , the promotion comes to carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the notification as follows :
use the button storing in order to save the settings for the notification to a file . use the button store to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Dele@@ te . all entries except all disadvantage are deleted .
Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , the voice speed , the volume , the sex of the voice and the pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , SS@@ ML currently supports and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice used in the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or audio position at the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog is not at 100@@ nbsp ; % adjusted , SS@@ ML text is commonly spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked mother bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sets text into single phrases . thus , if only the first set is synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also extend or stop back or break down , even if the language re@@ synthes@@ izer is not directly supported .
here you can see the Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ed filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a result of a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can change its settings , or add more Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ing filters , beginners will not come out of it .
the easiest way to learn the furnishings of the speaker choices by trying out . turn off on the car@@ tei@@ card orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose . place the speaker selection once again , change some properties and check how the selection of the person has changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
they then can stop or break text orders on the car@@ p card , even if the language re@@ synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter will automatically set up when you start the t@@ sm@@ el@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ing filter compare text with a regular expression of proposition and add a tab@@ ular character ( dec@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the proposition . ( tobacco ) are automatically removed from the fil@@ tering above the text ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter does not retain the string .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( cold ) , warnings , messages or output of screen readers .
if you have removed from seeing the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ed filter , you can insert this once again by load the file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file standard .
on the car@@ part map , you can write the spokes@@ person for the application . the car@@ tei@@ card is displayed when
use of the default language ( the top one on the cart card ) . in other words , there are no spokes@@ person .
use of the most suitable person , which shows all the features of the microphone . if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise he chooses to select this speaker . otherwise , he / she chooses to be the speaker that is the most sought @-@ in properties .
select the method for entering the desired spokes@@ person by clicking on one of the selection heads .
select the features of the desired person . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything .
highlight this event , if the property needs to be priori@@ tised over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
as the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language is ahead , if you know that a particular application text appears in a different language other than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of spokes@@ person , which is most likely to delete , click on the default tables , and then use the spokes@@ person listed below .
in this case , 0 is in queue for the last text box . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the entry is 0 necessary ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes down when it is started . I have de@@ bug Deb@@ u@@ g support but I don &apos;t get any feedback .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and c@@ il@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ STRE@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , it may not be a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the console ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts with algae occur , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use it at the festival , t@@ t@@ sm@@ el@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Note / Get the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the car@@ p card audio there is a setting speed . in order that this works , the program needs to be installed and over the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ om@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ Per@@ former@@ filters , and put the speech speed up .
I didn &apos;t manage that web pages will be read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work , the x@@ s@@ l file uses for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the Voice tags .
I have added a separate string chain filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer a tw@@ isting or back . in the cart @-@ rated orders is shown , the order best@@ owed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , bow@@ ls , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tered . use for these signs instead a filter for proposition detection .

some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also counted , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is bare . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices you can set volume , travel speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to pre @-@ read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this vote continues Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Mail / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to enter the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose an ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are designed to be first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer takes over the le@@ xi@@ fication analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice can be downloaded from

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; b contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings allows .
the &amp; Co@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K Menu T@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; b contro@@ l@@ center ; enabling the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; b contro@@ l@@ center ; displays . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; T@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not necessary to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed while installing and installed . network devices are added later , the drivers have to be loaded by adapting the following files , corresponding to the core version , loaded :
the module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; b contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index selected is selected . when starting the module network settings , this , the platform used in the system can be automatically recognized .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best suited . by marking the setting non @-@ again inquiries , the definition can be taken permanently . in the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set automatically .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , meaning that the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can click through clicking the button management system mode at the bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used for managing network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings in line network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog tool set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below shows the dialog with ongoing possibilities .
by selecting machines , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , TCP / IP Information is provided with each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list may be either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system selected .
you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net will be determined .
if this option is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on a switched network device is checked by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
sets the IP address of the machine in the local sub @-@ network that conv@@ eys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ networks .
if there is more than one network interface present on the computer , the interface needs to be selected , where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS replaces this name into an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer name for nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the rider &apos;s nam@@ ing solution allows an easy management of this list . entries may be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a tra@@ der and exec@@ uting or dem@@ otion in the list with the buttons , or storing in the priority .
by clicking the button you add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button add . the entry then is inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator you choose an entry and then click &quot; Edit .... It will be shown on the Edit dialog .
the lists specifically known calcul@@ ator describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNA @-@ server .
usually the list of known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still going to be analysed in the test version of IP is to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , then press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a name @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... the dialog of acquain@@ tan@@ ces will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , must be placed in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be reset .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is conf@@ use htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm packages ) it is sufficient , if &amp; k@@ de ; and q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a single console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface such as a package or the installation tool for your distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; b ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things is required .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile it . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second section are all discussed by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable Con@@ figuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network can be convey@@ ed .
currently IP networks are operated by TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found big spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected that it continues in the near future . this description is therefore currently focused on IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP @-@ address of a network interface is available . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact @-@ administrator which is available or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled by hiring a gate@@ ways .
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ A ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the standard route is required for IP @-@ transmission .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are located by &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , there is no other content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can happen .

&amp; nbsp ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . the first aim was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was the answer to a question which my wife provided : how much longer takes it when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it has to be involved from &amp; k@@ date ; it may be done in three ways :
&amp; nbsp ; Gi@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the Ban@@ des ein . realize &amp; k@@ date ; the lecture on the band is not , you are asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; dat files ; the pre@@ fix , it searches for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be newly created .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol is changing for the belt drive to show that the belt was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the banker may now be searched out by exec@@ uting the entry for the tape .
before picking up the bank , first must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; nbsp ; there is a change in the symbol for the tape that the involvement for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat files , it has to be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ date ; format@@ ted .
a band types must be format@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this operation does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ date ; it must happen before you get format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy belt drives usually put a format@@ ting of the bank advance , DA@@ T drives , however , not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; nbsp ; with the format@@ ting of the bank . all the data on the tape will be lost automatically ! after completing the format@@ ting , the volume is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you switch to the backup process , you need to select the secure files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file . it will only be backed by this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose to be sent to the menu ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings will open for securing . in this dialogue , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears backup . the dialog shows the progress of the process of safety , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder is checked .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . there are only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu item .
once the audit process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialogue , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears over . this dialog shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data flow and the remaining time .
before you can re @-@ establish the Rest@@ ore , the files that are to be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the belt drive . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be restored the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose to re@@ connect in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialog appears re @-@ manufacture . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ generate the index on two types of the tape :
this provides a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of secure files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders , which are listed under backup files , is that only those files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which lie on other fil@@ es@@ ystem , you can add separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is saved . it will only be saved files that have since changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to establish changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling the tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons are stored ; and lt , he@@ als ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item on K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to non @-@ recur@@ rence version of the band@@ man .
if this attitude is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ date ; before the band is involved , the command will be mt load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ date ; to unlock the throw at the belt drive . possibly this option does not work with all band drives .
if the option is turned on , the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; k@@ date ; automatically the volume is ej@@ ected . use this option not with flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ ering ; the hard@@ working block size for the belt drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you have to let &amp; k@@ date ; in any case the block size for your belt drive can be disclosed .
if &amp; nbsp ; one volume format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where calcul@@ ator of the complete name of the system is , on which the volume is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the band is format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup . this symbol is only active if a tape is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; b ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where to obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . in addition , the system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; quot ; log ; helps users understand what makes your computer working in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where to receive information about your system or where the system puts the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access for example on information about issues that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended features , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot , displays &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions at your disposal , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the system is trying to open &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ector . will not display it , and it opens instead of its small news window , so you have the protocol files under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also filter the filter bar to filter a distinctive crit@@ erion , or after the fil@@ tering strings . in the default setting , the selection range is displayed next to the filter file . then a log @-@ line will be displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search box is included .
you can also select a different entry at this point . the string of the filter search box will then be selected only with the entries in the selected column . select the name of a process in the protocol file system , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines sent to you which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the major protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a catching color as protocol lines of level notice . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on @-@ hand dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to jump new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage the menu . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information on the cat@@ ch@@ ment sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : music file ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts at the construction of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not continue to address historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ der is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was a one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you would like to start installing the system or switching to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ tes , which will only once run . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand beneath / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not own this file , even if there isn &apos;t much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something that has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel looks in@@ it in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the beginning a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have brought something through the in@@ it@@ tab , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you don &apos;t find the right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply , each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be called on the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , which is &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another line device is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) , so this will only happen if they have an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able system services .
note : entries are shifted if you move them into a new range . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of entries before you once again try to add the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different work areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons , to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another round level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually modify the sorting number or the name of an order , enter the input button to change the properties dialog . use the dialog button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; modifications to preference are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine will start constantly . what can I do ?
give the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not running .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary furniture programs in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by each system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just finish without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you must save it . either , use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; it is a simple application . the main window consists of two car@@ p cards , the user and the user list . to edit the user , select the user , or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it will be the dialog user or group properties .
some car@@ p cards are only shown if you have set up extended system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a car@@ p card will be created where shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the Pass@@ word Pass@@ word administration appears when Shadow Pass@@ words or etc / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this car@@ tei@@ card appears only if applicable to at least a built @-@ system file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change the parameters for each user , whereby the restrictions on data are stored in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ es@@ ystem . the current fil@@ es@@ ystem is selected with space constra@@ int with the help of the field file system .
the car@@ part card groups informs about the group belonging of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the great field .
the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user on the list .
to add a user or group , select &quot; Add to the user &quot; menu or group or click the appropriate add -@@ button of the tool@@ bar . editing or dele@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
