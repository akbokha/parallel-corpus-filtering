<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. babyfish in the best case produces a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without verifying the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should allow you to translate on the babyfish page itself, where you can insert too translatable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & conqueror; in spite of its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & Konqueror, making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about using & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the guide to & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To upload these modules in the & Konqueror, select Settings to set up.... open the carp card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules out of the package; add-ons. please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, which & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click here & Konqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; to crash, or the list of stormy, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Anpafilter (also called Folder filter) can be reached in the & Konqueror; menu bar under extras. with the module you can filter & conqueror; 's up-to-date working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM building in the & Konqueror; to use extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the document. as default, the display begins with the root notes of the document, example: the element, all other knots are underelements of this root junction.</seg>
<seg id="13">The & FSView module; for & Conqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME content inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to allow the content of your local filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in it, concealed folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then can be easily detected, if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, the FSView profile; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX, command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the recolding corner meaningful colorations and lettering settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on view of colour mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the presachings or the illustration of a different file, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can determine if enough space to display is present, or if the area of subordinate rectangles should appear (although therefore disappearing error can occur due to restrictions on the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be respected that the area is proportionate to the size of the item. in the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always maintained to represent the tightening of entries and this framework needs space, which is then lost to subordinate entries any longer. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As distribution of the area of an order for subordinate entries is carried out, the implementation is left up. here it is intended to divide and avoid space loss by frame getting beneficial the areas that are possible. the best methods of this are lines, columns, or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal covered area for an entry via the menu item. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the parent area, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView, was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets, which was developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="56">& Check; contains a fast image processing with base processing tools. you can use these to view your photos, comment, evaluate and correct. the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug-ins (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & checking came; easy to use, it represents dirt professional skills. it works fully in 16-bit color and all available modules support the raw converting using libraw, DNG-Export and ICC-colour workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved data base with much more metadata, such as the camera, via the camera or the lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & b; programmes are also available for publication; an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of the end user. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; try to explain the problem of problems or improvement of improvement as easy as possible for them. wherever you use, the Help menu contains a dialog with a strict linkage. if you use this linkage, your web browser opens a page in error handling system. all required information is already listed here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& Check; is a project which is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer come together. if you send a regular user of & digitised, then we would like to answer any questions to other users of & digitization; however, you may soon answer questions to other users of & digitization. in this mailing list, however, you should be spoken in English, you should therefore be mighty in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the publication; homepage visit to receive news about shared versions and other information about & digidied; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved, is the registration in the developer mailing list. guide to the report in the developer mailing list by & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you have been checking out; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. just enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the datalognk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folder as you would like to add. & digicame; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the pictures displayed as base folders. & digicame; considers every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the pass of the folder you will be able to show a progression like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "Check: thirsty, reference the reference path throughout his depth. you cannot exclude any subfolder, unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to get extraordinary folders and checking out by placing a point in front of the name of the subfolder." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums are put into mine list no photos as symbols. you can change it by taking any photo from the album and discard it on the folder. you will then find more details in the albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up at & Check; your digital camera will set up. afterwards, you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords, to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw material support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so it can also handle. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Rohkamcamera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh-Decoderm and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera module will be provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digitization; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras. of course, each medium and any card readers are supported by your operating system, with & digicame; together work.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be realised as USB mass storage device. the camera will also use the picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& nbsp; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which has a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. as photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection now is outdated. & digitization; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2 through. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphotographs 2 needs to be created with libexchange support. the EXIF support is needed by some libgetphotographs. if the EXIF support is not present in libgphoto2, you will possibly be able to see thumbnail or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at all, is how easy to expand their functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitization; to develop KPhotographic, Showimg and Gwenview. objective is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way, as it is also a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digicame; even carry out.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page with & LMB; remove or switch to full-screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Pulling and drop images everywhere: you can discard an image in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal separation line or into another application window. the only restriction is the one image not in keywords, date list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection makes it possible to lift you the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbols view. thus, the filtering will appear on the filename only if this ind will display symbolic views only if this row is displayed, you can configure it in the dialog of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; represents an organized view to your photoalben. these albums are stored in a single album tree; these albums are stored on the disk after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties, or by date when the album was created first. the date may be changed in the features of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">In case you have set up a scanner, you can scan a photo directly into an album. you can also add a screenshot directly to one album. choose the album Imported screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To move or move a picture from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and move it. in the then the passing menu you have to select whether the image can move through moving or copying. you simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>

<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to highlight your albums so you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you choose from the toolbar or view albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make it in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums after date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons, average, newest: these set the date on the one of the oldest, the latest image or the passage of the album. this is first tries to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first entered an album & digitised, the first image is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; chosen. this will help you remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the right-click menu & quot; As an album preview, you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be found only in a collection and collections can not be scrambled.</seg>
<seg id="95">& checking came; supports input of keyword for individual photos in the area My sampling list left at the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection always include all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>

<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datallottequot; organises your photos from the data. & digicame; uses for this either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change in the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">Selecting a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the file view, so you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalogues. tags are stickers who have been assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos displayed with this keyword are shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. here you can rest your keywords. you can also catch parts of the tree & quot; mine keyword quot; together, so you can find the keywords which you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The tags are stored in a database for quick access and weighted keyword in the IPTC data fields of the picture, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as it came; the pictures were noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new tags by clicking on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keywords, and then select new keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword after you have clicked on an existing one, this is the buzzword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and discard it. then a menu appears, which gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management assumes, indexed, categorised, assures, seeks, transforming, ready-assembled, and exports the content that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is designed according to your definition data, which provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your machine, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely use not & digitization;. the approach to save metadata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you maintain something in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure. you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored on your computer or on a network run & etc; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday makers can quickly find out about your location, unless you were in one year several times at the same place. if you want to use enough photos, then you will use subfolder such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflow, constant mapping of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% are registered and you will then not want to reorganise your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking-processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the setup page of metadata in & digitization; this ensures that exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item on the album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which changes? to do this, a metadata editor will be available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work, as you should now select each photo keywords, lettering and evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures that require the same attribute and then put the value then. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now talk with keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called upon other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogues images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree for you will rebuild the pictures in the right place. the changing of hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by adding a subtree to another. the changed keywords are monitored by & digitised, while it pursues the underground.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata reveals itself. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata is made up of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to protections or comments, the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let your photos just see your photos, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream of dreary associations, memories, the historical time span has come back, you might even hear the silence. the caption therefore has changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos is the title probably more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. think of the key it is the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand about the motive it moves you has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is OK if an image is not perfect if it only has the strength to act with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as signposting. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE produces a spelling after your wishes in the caption and / or the title of the web server system. you need to tell the story so for the opener is not a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation systems? was it not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the move of the spatial presentation now comes with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of geolocalisation are already inaccessible and will be repeated in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future you can open your travel virtually. this then shows the photos at the entrance. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googleMaps collection.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a game of words with copyright and dences the practice of copyright, to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information should be stored in the furniture page of & digi; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for instance, the name of a company or organization may be used. after that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for writer): associated with the author. this field contains the working-drawing of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note about the author's field, this field must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer does for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is a photo photo, then the group / agency gives the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic know-how in working with computers can clear or change the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important to this.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermarks per image is unique. & digitised; in the near future there will be such a module for stacking.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: record errors, record, blackout, ECC, transmission defect, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, Desasterecting, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same which can also happen to traditional paper photographs or negatives. in this section, it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the largest data collection in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must no longer be trusted for more than a few years. of course, you can also get CDs and DVDs within archiving. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe that is in your measurable room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you store good disks and good recording units and put them in the right way. best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it turns to select the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and control of control. despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that does appear wonders on CDs and DVDs, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar uses the damaged data from damaged floppies, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optic media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-Layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non-propriated format. afterwards, read the media with a description, date & author conmarks and after that in a clean, dark dry and above animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for yourself. your manufacturing party will include a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large field study on the fault mechanics of hard drives: disfault-study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold on the longest when you are operated in the temperature area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at a lower heat error, this error cannot be found. some of SMART announces the immediate pending withdrawals. this is especially Lesefehler and Publishers. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the full loss loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electric case before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices may not account much, this can cause severe damage on devices with computer chips and high-speed processing boards, complete data loss, hardware alternating, hardware boards and other defects, so you can protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is a part of the energy-heat absorbed by the rest. it is usually available in the form of a Steckerbar. however, remember that not every Steckerbar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then please note that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be careful that it offers protection against lightening heat and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be careful that also all perpherals are protected by your system. some manufacturers make overvoltage scorer which also contain a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable-cable and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete cut. even an exception of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overtensions, these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a blackout occurs. if you purchase an USV, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the living period of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern you the potential risk, which is exposed to your billing system, and compare its safety with electricity problems with the costs of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can only be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your machine is protected. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering that you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are at home compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suited to a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com provide online storage services provided on photos. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big firms is included in the offer a backup and a distribued memory. thus, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission. the file system zfs and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected, that there should be no protection to your computer. nobody seems to have been thinking about it. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they create interference within the data flows. with normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission issues, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with turntables at low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its original filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms which uses the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in job systems. with notebooks, the proportion of theft is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the seas. it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been no more sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, routinely, JFS and XFS, to name the widened filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corruptured data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and a defined status will be avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the principal cause of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 Blendences of fundamental physical boundaries. meant that while the technology further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and sound-characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 Megapixelometers. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">Thus, a 750GB hard drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else's losses. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strike you lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget about aircraft unfortunes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are for your data dangerous enough. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desastergears always means a non-local storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup who is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiations: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup. generates a complete snapshot on two periods: the complete backup and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time by which such a backup has been made. this backup will come to a payment system the next one with the exception that it is yields and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync just the difference of files that really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Get important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you discover enough time to discover losses and restore it. at the same time, you come for securing a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for every month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, find images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be heeded:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is due to your nature unforeseeable, you must consider everything that is said today using caution and reevaluate it while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to be compatible with caution. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switching to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everybody. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you've been planning the scalability with you and have placed the area you want to have on a dedicated album or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & Dollar; reset / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read more, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. however, it is loss of loss, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG cannot save many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licensed free and open raw format that developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is required for the use of metadata. a handful of cameras makes DNG now available and we hope to use the co-seekers of Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; imaging technology; a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is permitted with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your record, mostly in the raw format, to archived. XMP fits separate from the image file. however, there can be problems related to the link between the metatendatei and the image file, and as mentioned above, the shell format is formatted. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization which supports fully compatible online metadata standards, which supports a wide range of application and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on camera edium, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert the raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing process you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these were under circumstances cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital watermark. export them only in webgalleries, coding you in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & check; in section adding a photo to an album you will find a description, as you have photos, which you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for storing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking, connect them to the machine, turn the camera on display mode and turn it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the file order is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays files properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera. an icon shows that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturerratification, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata page bar, from the main window of & digitised; or picture editing. please note that these metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all. this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in & digitization;. downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired options available with the default methods of & b; as soon as you select the photos, use the button download and then download selected. the button is installed as long as you selected, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded by & digitization. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, you will of course download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all download or downloading, appears a dialog with which you can select the target album. the list of existing albums is displayed like regular folders. details of the folder you can read in the section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, press OK, and & Check; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the pictures you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once, by using the button delete all. if you only want to delete some, then you need to select them first and then delete cookies.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to have photos taken from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin. so you should check carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should do so much faster, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful name. the filenames are usually deleted once the photos from the camera are deleted. therefore, it can be useful to load the date and time when the picture was made to integrate in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dateline-based aport. if you use this option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens up three more options that are carried out before the photos on the disk are stored. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF data in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different format format than the standard format, you can use e.g. in the editing environment the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the Help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the option to change the filename in case letters. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which is used, for a photo, is displayed below the name, displayed by the camera in the preview. their settings for rename will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera records next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& Check; can perform all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording, not all cameras put this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turning is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't supply such information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic turn, use the button Advanced and select the Automatic rotations in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera will provide information about the date, where the photo is made available, it can create & digitised. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are available for this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case stores & digicame; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you have to switch this option. use the button below and select the option file-based lower jaw at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button download. select then uploading. you can select the files, which you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & b; methods.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartography an area by automated recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another & digitised. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised, users wish to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card referencing. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, through a postprocessing of GPS data and images with the KIPI module for the geographical mapping (manual) and finally about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPad AQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be processed with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store this data in gpx format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that extract data from pictures and from GPS and correlate. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the exifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the anterior coordinates, which will be created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, who show all navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Check; try to give you as much control over his working procedures as possible. there are many settings to change the behaviour of & digitization; to display at these settings, you have to change in the menu settings; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardization and copyright data. this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected for downloading the camera point. also in a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for writer: this field should be the professional designation of the photographer. these can be designations like e.g. pilot photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description of the car box, this field must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editors is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the image. this does not have to be the author if this is the picture other & quot; anbietenquot;. if the picture is a photo photo, then the group or agency that is available to the picture is listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rim. this means that the metadata is permanently available in the picture and not only came in the database of & digitization;. these metadata stand also available to other programs and can be imported into account; they will be imported without lost.</seg>

<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed parts of an image can be marked with darker and brighter color in the picture. these colors are defined here. in picture editing, this picture-mode can be installed with F10 and F11 and will be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia for the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">By setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG used a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can use this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed you can switch the deflate -compression age for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the deflate algorithm loss is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can loss lossy. even if you choose the lossy adjustment, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata were not yet supported, but in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitised, the image processing was only one image editor for photos. currently, it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default approach is that all green pixel are equal to ultra-violet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference produces a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option distinguishes the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD standard method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white-off camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour-balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the whitening is not set. standard it is a fixed colour balance, which was shot on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This option is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. use of the second sensors has the effect that underpin images in four steps will get more details in the shretention. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default it is the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the incapacity of your camera they catch the top-size results. the setting colors redeem some unusual results, as they reconstruct the shreporter in various Rosatönen. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the Spitsacks.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general does not have to reconstruct as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red-sharks from the not yet saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question, how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the option reconstruct, you get the option to bet a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzworth according to your taste. you probably have to put it a bit higher than standard 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digitization; to keep the time for the demoosicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demoosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete picture from the sub-filtered images that have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& D came; and Dcrab will provide you with three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG-Interpolation (Variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. but Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you run during the drafting.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color formations and gives instructions how this should be given. there are also LCMS and & digitization; information like the color-formations are to be translated into the other thus the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if an image is opened in image processing / color-administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setts you here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / etc / / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & Check; this folder will examine then during Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures coloured does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Input profiles should be applied to the camera manufacturer and model that you use. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-mapping or gammacorrect. currently, dcrab gamma does not need to perform conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you have to carry out the color test itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof Profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be released from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated. you could manually correct it instead of having to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them for what is intended. unfortunately, here are a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally unofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface which is supported by a number of & cheque; illustrated works and imaging works. through the willingness of this interface can be supported, many modules are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use, and they will then be loaded from & digitised. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some also in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short instructions for tasks implemented by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>

<seg id="338">Picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. therefore, some of them are available as modules in & digitization; therefore you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, you can set up in the picture editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current date, the current date, and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top level, including the toolbar to quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of picture editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you store file Save or the button Save out of the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original shot as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore select a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file saving as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Station Restore or the button 'Restore der Bildediting Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have performed on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image processing can be undone or recovered. the last action you can undo by selecting the back-back or restored by selecting the reconnecting from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the shortcut shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for the backend and Ctrl; -Shift key to Restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; for a moment longer, click on the registrar or Restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a right-click menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started working editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have changes in the current photo, you are asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; Mausrad or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansichord menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode. you come in the normal view, in which you use the Escape key. if you do not want this, you can call this in the dialog dialog of & digitization; change this. you can call this in the dialog dialog by & digitised. you can also view this section for viewing the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select image in the menu and get the standard & cde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. you just need to select the images from your selection. you just need to select the pictures selected using the default methods and select from the menu Expore printer. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & D came; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions available for the selected photos. the same page bar is available without the Navigationspelt, also available in picture editing. it is shown when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or will disappear into the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description of resolution you can enter or insert confisations with unlimited size. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are formed after 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC feeding field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented on, you either use the button application or simply switch to the next picture, the signs are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user-button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also send the metadata to the files. however, this is always performed if you chose a metadata default that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate several images simultaneously, select them and use the right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords show a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords-tree and a selection box with the before in this & digitised; session shown keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be dynamically adjusted to the search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you typed several keywords, they will be stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding attacks in the tree. all tags of an image are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, and you can select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire range, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar stitched filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - Datum-, keywords, and viewpoints are used. if one or more keyb filter is used out of the right side, only the intersection of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag tags and discard. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view, to provide you with keyword. if the keywords already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and on the selection. then, a dialog appears, you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keywords filter is written on No keywords, which has been chosen with Ctrl + a and afterwards a keyword was drawn from the right spot tree to the selection and set there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be subject to settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or its, you can easily change this with a double-clicking on the text and the rules.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is sought in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a complete search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just need to use the crossroads at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited there on 1 GB, and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfull-managed workflow is that the colors available from your camera or scanner come a predictable deviation of the actually photographed and salted colors. using a colorfull-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor, those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web that match them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everybody wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information on colour management. in addition, you will provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workworkflow meets all the criteria below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB version. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other pictures are via e-mail or the Web, where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works as well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and make your thoughts about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of Limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbrew, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, then visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on info and then to information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to kallify my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB Farbrem?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working at sRGB-Farms or not, you need to callify your monitor, da sRGB, you need to work out the circle. if you work as in the Faruse of sRGB, you need to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual process.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automation, and contrast extend from the menu Korrigidly automatic correction attempt to automatically make your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values about the whole picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shades. this feature is often a magnet for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method jushed the lighthouse factor of colors of the selected image, so that the hologram of the intention is the same number of pixel. sometimes it achieves very good results in improving the contradiction of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful surgery that causes either miracles in a picture or it is destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scanning: this method maximizes the color area in the rot-, green- and blue channel. it defines the dark and bright border-tones and jushed the rot-, greenish and blue-channels on the entire histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible in outward images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-bout of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is a bit limited because of a color-bit with 8-bit per color. if you can perform too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can perform the white-bit in the raw mode, which in the 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better displayed.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equivalent degeneration of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu-containing colors white-off of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and preview of the target picture. if you want to see the original white sand, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hologram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right upstairs, a hologram is shown that dynamic when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful as soon as you have one parameter. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow of alignment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even download.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat is to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the captions to use selected color for the calculation of color-temperature of the white-layer. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white-off with the presets list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overview indication increases colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will get the combined result displayed in the white-screen. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this. any adjustment of the white comparison you have set you can save in a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings sets all filtering values back to their default values and the associated neutral whips. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you store this image your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the code-loop per colour channel of the working image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding requires also more disk space, computing time and stands onlyfor the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonsican be carried out through the subwindow for the brightness of color profiles. detailed instructions for the use of colour profils can be drawn to the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu with colors sound correct. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for the key correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool flange effects puts you four folding effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar, also called Sabatier, an effect of this was created when one completed a partial pressure of a short flashlight. this had the effect that the lightly ranges were inverted and the colors inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to make this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ization. at about 50% intensity shows the image which is chemically possible. another increase creates an negativity that so did not produce at photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar impact. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation effect that it has a stronger contrasting effect, which makes colours brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the awame for one on daylight optimized paint movie produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors at daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a movie of choice for natural photoographs. Velvias heavily saturated colors are also some photoographs, especially those which hardly any landscapes are intentional.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contraindications. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neonlight. in large images the filter can pick the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the tools in the menu with colors. all your adjustment can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a picture with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce a good choice to increase surgery. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminance / contrast / Gamma is the tool audio-correct to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated, you need for the application in use only the area of slider. concrete the three slider below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the Intensity values, a histologram, the active canal or the selected range. below the graphs are three sliders into which they can change in, and they can be moved to change the intention's values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to operate the operation is to postpone the regulator and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear representation is frequently dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear history is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic insertion is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammam.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colored pinpallets can be used in the sneak of the original image to automatically adjust the input-rated of shadows, middle and bright notes automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit status: the selection rated allow the selection of manual value for each area. there are also two regulators who can be used to change the payroll interacting as with the input points. for example, the compression of the payroll can be used for example to create a sealed image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and loaded later. it will be used to Gimp the format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and use the three color tubes, the input-rated is automatically reactivated for all shadows, means and sun-tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for the input of the histograms for red, greenish, blue and luminata channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overloaded Inkator controls all color channels to display more exposed pixels and you can display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input areas applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the exit status is unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed. the preview is dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications Channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the module changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of sensory mode. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps you further.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you'd like to postpone a curny to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright sounds with darker spin-gades and that the image pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each bend that you have created can be saved in filesystem and loaded later. file format is the Gimp format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipets buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, central and solar tones. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click the original image to set the checkpoints for the rotor, green-, blue and luminescent curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overloaded Inkator controls all color channels to display over-load pixels. if in more than one channel overlacked pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and white picture which was corrected in the luminous canal. shadow and Sundays was applied with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixing mixer of the & digitization; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors canal blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the canal box you can select the color for the hologram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window will show you a preview. the original can be seen in comparison with the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you can position this in the picture a vertical line in the hologram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to preserve the appropriate color components, since the channel blender can also enable the option to generate great black and white conversions for your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise which occurs from the colts. color consists of small roughodes, which looks different from the same spot. if that is the case you can reduce your monochrome conversion through which you can reduce the color test first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer setting you can save it for later and then download. the used file format is the Gimp Mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overloaded Inkator controls all color channels to display more exposed pixels and you can display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that is, you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the Blue canal became new. the original image is activated. the original image is under (1) and the modified image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, as color images can easily be converted to the machine. also with a set of film-roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Grünfilter: simulates a black / white film seal with a green lime filter. this looks good, with all the scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfilmed: simulates a black / white film seal with a orange filter filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air-photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film seal with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic economy effects and can simulate rescrested on day-time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film seal with a yellow liner filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones, while he adds a little bit coldness into the slump of a pressure and the re-development in one Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitised; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the thrust of an old master, a pop kind of portrait made of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of depth or three-dimensionality of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect was applied to the picture below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">"" "with the" "" "tool" "" "tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image." ""</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping an eye on the boundaries of a photo is no easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to scrolling eye. under picture frames can add the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired course type for your image. throughout the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide framework (ideal for black and white images), exhausts handle it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button-effect and decorative adds a ornamental with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: sets the width of the frame in percent. the value area for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio is important for the printing of images, especially if you have used the mold after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image of any position. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text excerpt, orientation, color from the color size and the character set with its features as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button 'OK'. after the picture was once saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitization; tool stencil apply you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Picture Schablone can be used in image editing, in order to put messages about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to revising the file size of the stencil. if you want to add your Schablone of the template database, so you simply send an e-mail in English to the & digicame; mailing list checking came-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you must put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog box. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil template. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils was set out, a tree-view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil template. selecting a folder updated the thumbnail of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Among the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button augmented the image below. it is centred around the mouse position. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button shrinks the image below. it is centred around the mouse position. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must rescale the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to postpone the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">"" "" "" "checking, three different tools are available for raising. each one of you has advantages in other areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharks. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask is working at the contrast of the edges to look at an image sharper. you can use it to remove atmospheric dark and it is here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the edge. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digital images require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to that the digitalization process can be summed up with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more downstream than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG images often a camera has been applied internal booths. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner should turn to the focal filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable them, you get control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by raising up a photo with the edge of sharpen. this allows you to call the "" "" Classic "" "" drawing up "" "" drawing up "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should deal with this, however, because the results are not very natural: the sharpens increases the edges of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus on. you can reach it via the menu entry corrigidity. below refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharks.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to switch to the softness with the menu item corrigidity, and experiment with something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter insharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview look at the image. the preview display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the unsharpened mask become strong, rustle and the impression of freats will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a canoe hit by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radios. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one that is added to the original. this will put the strength of acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference. it can thus define a minimum difference for a canoe of filters. in this way areas are avoided with a soft switch between the tones of sharks and hence beauty errors in faces, Heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the edge. it used the copyrighted unfolding for the algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo a picture to & quot; refocussing quot; in which there is a better approach than just trying the photo. it is used to focus on a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technology to sharpens images is the use of a sharpness mask. you can usually start better results than unsharp mask. you can start it out of the menu by viewing colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung works far better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung leads to a very long tail, that depends far from the source pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular acuity: this is the most important parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most pictures the default value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but should pay attention to Heiligenchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 rarely useful. if the smoke filter is too low, the filter quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value is still further lubricated.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauze'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the gauze'sche sharpness. use this parameter when your unsharpened filter is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequaled zero, you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoke filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mould size: this value determines the size of the transformational atrix. an increase in the size of the transformative size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular acuity or gauze'schen sharpness. however, note that the module will be very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and intention-points on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that plenty of operations changes are not immediately visible, but which later left unconvenient artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress pictures, more than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp mascara produce better results than sharks. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighbourhood used as acutovens.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of unsharper filters. for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter. virtually is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in treating small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp paint picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to unlimited light for the car-focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of raising visual correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smootte continues the sharpness of the area of the bottled water to produce a more natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-failed tool is one of the most widely developed tool to remove no desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm has been developed by the image team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CEg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets than starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to use the filtering settings to a jusy you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailure p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a smaller value leads to an even more homogeneous regions smoother and details blur. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening is intolerable. please note that the details of the details of the machine addiction should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Traction addiction: alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film body, or CCD Raue will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed from 1 value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Glazed [0, 500]: this puts the maximal smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothes, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm goes through. usually, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Winkelo-long da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should also be small for a long term. therefore, you should therefore choose to have this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride wide into pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation uses: the more quality you get through choice of this option is only low. it doubled but the runtime. we recommend it to you.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this. each adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Images correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knocking at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected using one artifacts. the module is made on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that caused by a bad filming during the trip (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & D came; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease imaging. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable captive filters available to remove stains and other artefacts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor detectors from the camera or Moicharute; remove effects of scanned images made of books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor extracts from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granny smoking that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the sub-window advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large numbers increase the time the filter per pixel and can blurred the image. the area covered by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is smoothes and hence minor errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focal point. this value sets the pixel filter to ascertain. if it is lifted up, smoke detects will change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image can no longer receive and smoker or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filtering. if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise, if you want to remove it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a narrow smoker or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or energy-density to improve a picture. these settings don't affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour-intolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or energy-density to improve a picture. these settings don't affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically become stronger, but he also performs the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of the phasenjitteriness. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if he is lifted up, the edges appear smoother. if he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. he can remove spacesptips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for the smoking reduction that you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the reduction of smoking was applied with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to excel the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than an image to sharpens and experiment with the smooth. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & nbsp; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoartefakte.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to show Gauß's sound, film-based, compressive and local mistakes that emerge in digital, original or subsequently digital images. the smoothing takes place along the picture contours and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm can be used for colour and text replacement. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the image team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frans and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG facts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression age, he creates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed picture. this attitude should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons are saving as and shop make this exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-like noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous filmmakers on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time, textures was reduced to an old color photo, which has been read with a scanner, which was caused by scanning lighting and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & nbsp; tool hotpixel allows Hotpixel photos with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw mode photos a problem, since many cameras with JPEG compression about a built-in repression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and" "" "bright pixel quot; to remove a photo with a dark-image method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you have the dark picture directly after you to discover new hot or bright pixels through cCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark picture to the correct image. an automatic processing of the dark's image will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant picture the last dark picture and it will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture. the preview display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpin this pixelblocks. this is the available Filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: there will be an average of the neighbour pixel. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this will be separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpin the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn up to a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim), which then is used to interpin the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubo: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be approached to compel a bi-Cuban surface (1-dim) or a group of cubical curves (1-dim), which then is used to interpin the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction to a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged at 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & D came; VignettierungsSurgery is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. submerged corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foreseen lenses, particularly those in medium and large photoformat, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettieri quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there. Telelenses also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many center-filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. foreseen lenses should use, even with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise the sharpest effects caused by movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposing areas of today's filtering and / or gray-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three rectors you can control the Vignettierungsktur filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: these parameters checks the degree of light stimulation at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2,0, which compensates a optical filter with a speed adjustment of 1, or by chance to compensate a density of vignetting to a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminance, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignetting corrections reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to readjust the loading of the target with these options. the regulator will provide you only positive values, as you need to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a better adjustment of the exposure of the goal, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digitization; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting corrections applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct picture. a luminance and contradiction time was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & D came; Linked distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or conveexe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar circular effect, flawed but at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Grades. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of second grains. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected, and positive values cushion-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of Grades. this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has generalized the reverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size, and thus leads a correction of the first Grades through. negative values increase while positive the picture rescent.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightly: this value jusates the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortions correct. the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cushion correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes. the best result is to cut this correction as of all first. if you make a picture anew, and then, a tonal correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is provided to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move it to an important place like e.g. the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards you can correct the tonn- / cushion wiping with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you rectify a gradient, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transformers from the image processing or over zoom repel of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tone-shaped correction is drawn. the next logical step for some motives like e.g. photographs from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnform correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpcuo.org website that is accessible from this URL. the filter reproduced the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this movie has a Sensitive area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters to simulate film graffness and film-sensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the quantity of the body granules and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels make to reproduce by infrared movie, especially the green channel, it doesn't make sense the effect on black / white photographs, as the color-formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the modified image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the shretention.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filters film grains is an easy to use tool to reproduce filmmakers on your pictures. this is known by classical high speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, the manufacturer of great silver granules of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grandes effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, cable photographic, granular image especially into your monochroman photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granarity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film body effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter Oil painting produced the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & nbsp; filter Oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to affect this effect. the upper elects the brush between one and five. thicker brushes are better for bigger images. smooth the glasses or, viewed from the other side, the magnificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the working is marked with the (2). brush-size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and Trosette 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & D came; filter coal-drawing uses color and intensive gradient to create a carbon dioxide. the lines that change the contours in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you had chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower justs the contrast (glasses).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved further through adaptation of the intention.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitization; Filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was beamed in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & D came; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and this processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distorting effects. it is used by protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image in cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wave-flocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of sharpen effects. it is used by protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom unsharpness: wipes the picture along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the sharpness an zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in the sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insolves: blurring the image by rotation of the pixels to a center. this simulates the sharpness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removing ponderings: caught the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Mobility sharpness: blurring the image through horizontal moves of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographs, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness wires: blurring the image soft at the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or for adding a warm and subtle bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sutshunsharpened: blurring the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent immeasurments: finds the colorations in the picture and catches it without changing it without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixelwert, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your picture. this gives it natural your images a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drip. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the number and the density of drops. fish stocks changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & nbsp; picture editing a area free of rain drops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you then start the filter drops, the area will stay free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regentropes filters. the original image (1) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirror or turning into the correct orientation. the tools you can find in the menu transformer or transformer mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrubs is simple. the big question is how can you zooming an image and blur the details? how can you invent the missing information again? how can you invent the missing information again? how can the missing information be used again? how can you use the missing information here, make a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear application method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation for enlarge an image. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the image team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio maintained: if this option is enabled, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothes, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons are saving as and the shop will be used precisely for them. each single unit for photo can enlarge as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and drag a high CPU load. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by adding a small color screen to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard increase in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequent run-run operation, but also a commonly underestimated tool to put an image. image processing allows you to just use the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you are moving the mouse while watching the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can draw the size of one to the cutting area by creating a new rectangle by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the dissection, use the button "Add-button of the machine editing in the toolbar, and the photo is designed (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file saving under the menu file to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the view, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mold after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of height and in the cross-format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Up convergence uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialogue, you can set the area with the Max. relationship button to cutting the maximum possible, depending on your chosen relation and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Up bracket stores its settings dependent on the orientation (horizon horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image measurements are reflected in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF tables and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination assistance allow help to set up your images, so that you can better set your pictures better. these aid are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of the similarity. like the third-party gel, the harmonic triangles are a possibility to rangle a rectangle into the same harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden middle is a division which sets out different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus snail or the leaf-blades of a sun flower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used with ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two foregoing numbers. the originating divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that this rule is seen as visually harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle puts liminal auxiliary lines if you put an image below. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third watch, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the picture. this type of composition guides the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the justification of the golden spiral, also Golden triangles. these rectangular corner are used to create the golden spiral. this can be something or different objects. this one can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also guided by the golden spiral lines at the top. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden corner. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are no equivalent to these lines. diagonal to put on these lines can be a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of professional photographed dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal flip and Vertically flip can be used to reflect the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any corner.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things have turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digitised; image processing and the tool-free rotation. choose to convert free rotation and jusse your target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are stated in degrees. with the button preference you can set the slide back to 0 degree. a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module will provide free rotation and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the visual inspection to position the two lines. once you move across an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, you describe the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function transformers cutting from the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All speculative transformers are performed to a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialogue, you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right upstairs: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle to degree at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">Depending on the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little buzzling. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create an twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you fit the perspective you get unwelcome triangular holes in the corners. one way to do this, it's the image with transformers cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mould tool is used to postpone part of the picture in one direction and postpone the other parts to the opposite. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle will be turned into a parallel hologram. you can launch this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will display you and display the new dimensions of the target image to the right of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="680">Your help will be vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of one building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the switching tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having performed the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two shots produced twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the image with transformers cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Check; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write tables. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were complied with. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all files available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Check; shows only files in formats that knows. this will happen on the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the picture editing. you can change this list of file extenders, which change. in the section configuration you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the used format. a fuller description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. thereby redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smooth results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save lossy when it is stated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw material, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert the raw material pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the Rohani converter. in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with & digitised;.</seg>

<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper in standard photosizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened with imaging Gimp. this is e.g: useful to enhance your or use the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your data stored in one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM respectively.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original district of Him is: expect you from dcraw not that there are the same results as the software developed by your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get crab better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image window window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now revise the values to optimize the convergence process. the first option is to use the camera settings for the white sand. the key parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can jushed. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected so you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the enhancement is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss of loss and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are planning to deal with your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format since it allows only a limited number of operations before the picture quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start installing the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can break off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack-processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures. however, you have the possibility to rewrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier trial. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can reduce the image or enlarge. four types of images are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, chosen. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is subject to change in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: preparing the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, random size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected photos with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the previous images before. further pictures can draw on the list of images to be drawn up and discard it.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images -window with the images you have selected will be displayed. you can add more pictures to the button below. for the last displayed picture, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and put it there in order to add to the list of images to be used.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the icon images, the selected photos will be removed from the list of images to be found.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can OK with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail clients. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select are attached already as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be sure to send out too many pictures on one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and each time is used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in an attached file, the comments on the images are put together in a text file and the mail was laid.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best adapted among loss free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG below images file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata are added to the missing images.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is ready, the window will not automatically closed the status of status, in search of errors, can be seen automatically. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button slict you can shlie this window?</seg>
<seg id="885">After Started of the module of Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to have your Slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transmission through OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, because otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an Endlossloop. you can then manually break up with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select is that the images are shown in random order. so it will not be used to order the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delays between images can be the temporary distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should have fun before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions, between which you can choose. by chance you choose another effect in every transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During Slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen, you can see the current filename, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date jusse currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. caution: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background to your KDE workflow.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can watch with & cphotographs; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries for viewing after EXIF based information, to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse to the entry people, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown by some thousand images on some single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can display with thumbnails to view the pictures of your host.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before their name. you can store with & cphotographs; however, for each person you can save his own pre-image, this is of course also available for places, keywords, and other categories that you have self defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button, which is located on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that if you choose to apply for the current category. please note that if you choose to adjust for each category you can see for example symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must determine which image is to be displayed for each individual person. here you can open the image Ansichts window (in detail) and select in the context menu the entry categories editor. here you can choose the picture for the appropriate person. in the Ansichord window you can adjust the magnifying factor to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialogue for the feast of the picture qualities. this dialogue can be seen on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description, the captions and descriptions of images are searched for this text. if you want you can also enter a date, for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotographs;. if you do not like to read handbooks, but prefer to try out the functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotographs; and check out the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & box album; and choose in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & box album; for the first time, or select in the menu for the menu item record; -demo start. then, some example images are loaded and you can try the features of & box album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotographs; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of the main window; see the timeline. a picture of these signposts you can see here:. as the name suggests, this Leiste displays you data statistics about the pictures in your base.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different periods of time. each listing shows then another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the Leiste only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use on the following ways: you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview video) and also displays the timeline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by clicking the mouse button depressed and the mouse over the lineal of the timeline, so the time information, draw. if you select a range, you will only click images of this timeframe. you can select the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Spphotographed album, puts you two possibilities available to create HTML-websites with your pictures. the one is integrated in & concubby; described in the following part of the user guide; integrated version which you can create about the HTML File menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, every area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the stream and a description that the HTML file should contain later. at the photographs; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & box album; export file is to be seen on the lookout page. nutritional information on the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information displayed on the HTML pages will be displayed. so, you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer is obvious. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. note that all pictures are exported from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images before specific considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look like. most settings are unique, which is why not specifically made to them.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. this way, those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can be downloaded for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time. so, it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, place the different folder and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to choose for all your HTML files, and for every subsequent set, select a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible for viewers. if you have created your URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages you have created, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will be launched in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files provided by you are not in the final target folder, you need to copy them manually. thus, the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three to base folders or URLs, in which a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & B photographs; however, you may want to create a HTML-page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already applied a lot of time for considering the pictures, location, etc. then you have to do with & splinalbum; this work does not even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Spphotographed album, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the Bilissions are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored with in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images. the advantage includes all images together, and that file can be distributed as independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the pictures in a double way. first, the images are not found, so the images are displayed in the URL, which you specified when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the export of images described you can call about the menu Expore... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you make manuel near the .kim file, you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatic to copy the .kim file, copy & kphotographs; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed to JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually does not use the files to compress. if you would like this, simply select the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is maximum image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with an extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importers..., it is released, the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importers consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you're called to the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called on your base. that's why you are asked in the third dialogue window, which categories of the imported file are to be imported, and which categories they correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to merge the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and view: when you look at pictures you often want to look inside different picture groups and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this guide you will pass the various steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, above (2) the way to go through (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook it is spoken about pictures, but frequently this also closes the videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Point album; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file which you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they can.</seg>
<seg id="950">& album album; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future start album. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start the photo album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu output settings, set up... you will come to a window with which you can change the settings of & box album. in the following section of the user guide, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">The links you can see six different symbols, with which you can access settings, preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed aid is available, which you can call through one button to the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can set up different properties for each image, e.g. individuals, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On view the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a mediator like in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings that are available to you for the rest of the membership groups. with the above listed selection list, you can select the category which you want to configure. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& album album; shares his module with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nutritional information about this can be found on the site of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & Spphotographed album, but are distributed separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are shared between multiple applications each one with each other, it may be that the modules were tested with the demo database. this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo file, before you call it to your own pictures, demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't tell you, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, allowing it to be that some modules with & box album; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & concubby; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & cphoto album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulates & kphotographed album; the current album, which is just the current view, so all pictures, which shows you at the moment at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album & album album, the modules also pass a list of albums at all. this works & photographs; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & box album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have defined in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you use for example the category people will do, so do if you would have selected persons to view and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & box album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the field modules which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example of a starting screen, once you start the photo album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE uses, you can see the window at the top of a menu and a toolbar. in the section we don't have a lot of information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, now click on the entry pictures that shows you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotographs; is the possibility to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box by typing people, places and keywords, these are a very important part of the photo album, as you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the pictures inside the list: if for example, you have a family celebration and are listed on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, so you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and to arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to have a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected suggestions for each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images and provide those pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the images before and back buttons, which are located underneath the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multier entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California lie all over the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window that shows the USA as an overview group. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can also make an entry in one category and discard it in order to sort this subcategory of this item. caution, this requires that you can just sort your categories alphabetically. see it here.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the area of interest by clicking the Leiste, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by setting it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the button Options..., which offers you the option of storing the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also release a frame completely. if you want to get this window again later, use the button options... and here you can see window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will receive an overview with thumbnail images of the currently selected photos, or of all images in case you don't have a filter here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply down drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you make an image in the background of your desktop, this picture is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it is displayed at the picture of the picture. if you have not yet opened a window with a picture panel, a new ad window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image gallery. simply select the corresponding pictures from which you would like to delete, and press either the Delete key or select in the Edit menu. now you can view the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Spphotographed album, offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures, without you saved on your hard disk. of course you have to record the pictures somewhere, so the photo album; in the picture you see the view of & box album; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper hand is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so you can display the thumbnail pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the image editor.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you may see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it. so far, it does not support you to ask the inserting of the respective CD. if you would like to avoid aggravation as the mess Bring of your images, please purchase a larger disk, in order to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you can filter the pictures that you want for other inaccessible and click on Current view in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also view all pictures that may see your little sister, ascending and choose the menu item all out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">In order to set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to unlock the laptop with your little sister, simply select the pictures you have locked up. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be inserted to block the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture guard is by no means very safe. for one of them all pictures on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone who can read on the file index.xml, can read the password as unencrypted text or delete it. this kind of password protection serves only those who are familiar with & ctural album; not very familiar to repel the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all of your pictures with & cphotographed album; and of course you spend hours on hours with it is natural that you wish to look at them sometime. for this reason & photographs. this is why you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows of course the picture, but additional all the information you enter about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, then you can easily drag them with the mouse and discard elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all of these options are available after a right click of the viewer. the right-click menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on Anne Helene, the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and move back by using the keys image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as Diaschau. & box album; then invites a new image after a few seconds. how often it can load a new image by pressing the stre button and Plus or minus press. started and halted the slides through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful capability of the spectator of & anecdotalbum; it is in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can drag the image in and out zooming. at the minus button you can easily drag a rectangle with the mouse. the Plus button is zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not drawn zoomed. with the gender-key sets the zooms, so that each pixel appears on the screen to a pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work in videos that are in and out zooming with the plus and Minux.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screenfunctions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you can see an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can watch the image and enter the configuration dialog of the picture. however, you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark it as good or badly, while you see one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer provides the opportunity to provide images with features, while you see them. features are the letter A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view, you see an image where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set characteristics on your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you choose, so add one module to copy the images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be shown in the thumbnail. if you can view categories in Dre preview view, then you can add features to the pictures by simply selecting the letter to the characteristic after the picture was chosen. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case allows you to paint & photographs; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can revert your gemold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on the painted picture. to turn off the painting mode from the context menu; just select the picture from the context menu. to quit the picture, simply put the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovelleler; you need to work out the application of the program & Povray; not completely control, but the documentation regarding & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the lenses and display the object in the wire-file views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following folding menu will be displayed, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With erasing either from the menu bar or from the right-click menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on the user to adopt these changes. have the invalid values indicated, then you can correct the editing mistake and again click on the user or the changes with abortions.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object by calling.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture you can preview a preview in the Featural view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press the thumbnail in her own view and a small example of the scene is made with the chosen texture. as default, the whole texture is rounded, even if you want to choose a subordinate element. if you only want a portion of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), add locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can pull these checkpoints with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and spin as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual level as a wire level. you can indicate this value relatively to the Visibility level of the superior object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; it has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the lenses are left and the four graphic views on the right are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different order, you can adjust it to you. you can also save several windings and simply switch between different agendas.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over one another, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the top-card top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to resolve a view out of the anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop or click the little to the left top arrow in the collar bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In order to close a view, click on the small cross in the collar bar. to avoid the lock, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are hovering, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window arrangement. it is displayed a dialog, in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rename them. & kpovelleler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is released in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To capture the current scene, click on the icon Renate the symbol Renate in the toolbar or select the menu entry scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon at The Render settings in the toolbar or in the View menu Render modes... choose the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, however, useful is a name that leaves the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the carpart map size you can add the width and height of the framed picture. if you want to rename only a small area of the image, select the cross section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinational field quality you can select the properties available & Povray; for rendering use. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user's manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rounded with only one beam pixels, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè-pattern or stool-effect effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details do not appear if they are in the representation smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because every pixel is constantly being divided and adaptive because the recursively increases of the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray of pixels. if the difference between the colour values to the preceding pixel, both pixels will be charged by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you adjust the depth of 4x4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between colors values the pre-determined threshold, the pixels becomes divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be followed separately and on additional sub-pixels. the maximum depth of recursion can be set up with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of drugs for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering changes, changes & Povray; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse lightreflexion. it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this carp map, you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is then transparent if the associated rays made no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -Consolation. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -Scene, select the menu item importers... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command-catcher of & Povray; if when importing error messages or warnings occur, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can move objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; to export objects in the text file in the editor. to import objects in the scene, just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovelleler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, if & kpovmodeler; a scene renounce. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the Featural view, opens & kpovelleler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. place the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example high-ups) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you want files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also add the path to these files here. if a file is located in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view in the camera view and in the window-type marker.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch the points on the button-click menu of the wire model views. you can set the raster separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values provide an accurate wire model, making a better approach for the objects shown, but require more time to Renate. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the details level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the High detailled for advanced projections, all the wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in better approach for projections, but requires more time to return.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you display wall signals crossed a wall behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you display bottom, a ground beneath the objects is removed. the ground is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you disable edge-edge methods for renders the scenes, the non-recursive anti-oxidant method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can set you. more precise information about parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangement or create new window arrangement. in the window arrangement rules, you can create and store window arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The default box standard-window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangement. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list available window arrangement displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be added with the button add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window, with the new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchor your window under the existing window, with carteies you get a carp view view along with the previous view and webcast, view not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovelleler; and now you would like to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate however simple scene, among beginners very popular: a bullet at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should take the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can get as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">When you do not set a camera, no rules for renders can be applied as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert lighting sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-introduced window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation that you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols are now frequently used, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item to delete. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, see the contents of view lenses in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is displayed later instructions, but note that the camera in view has control points, with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. simply click on the box and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree will immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a Quader for example (insert Enk body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an obvious method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simple possibility. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button User or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Now the wire model view now shows the level, albeit in the moment only as a limited endsetting. if you renches the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you click on the icon for the ground if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case, you'll see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the skyline lines, so that you will get to know some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases there is a dialogue where you can choose how the object is to be inserted. the pigment will then change in the object tree. you can view the name in Featural view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button preview how the pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matted black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are looking for a color on the Quader and ball, click on the button user-button only and then call for the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you are using your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color you expected. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called monochroe. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree every time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the lenses:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can just as easily create as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the lenses you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button user), so the ball over the ground would float over the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yields a strange result: as already before, the puffer appears like a matted black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already at the ground, you give the ball a pigment as paint:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in the sphere of pigment. click on the sphere of pigment, then select then monochroe and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the images below and click on the user button or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection results already in part good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayancy is a method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you play a scene raytracen, the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that reduces the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render is calculated, how this beam works through objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog influence. thus, the scene pixels for pixels edited.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a source of light, you also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene, which is to be removed, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard-file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in the submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Puts the scene again in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">In this menu, you can only select if you haven't saved any other changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversal command. you can only select this menu, if you have used them back.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or rewrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for hiring & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can add or add new commands with this option; commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to setup the toolbar. you can add and remove the commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to model rough finishes without having to model any broil on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then continue edited to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base, by using a image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image editor and browser. the application features a file browser in which you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can preview with Click & LMBn; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you search for a specific file, simply type the first characters in the browser window. then a small input box appears in the lower right corner. if a suitable file name appears, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc;</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue - & kuickshow; there are five carp cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the other two, short instructions for the ad window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcut can be specified for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the pictures are opened in full-screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can continue to set down. default is not a full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loads & spickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option, saves & kuickshow; passing the name of the most recently opened folder. at the next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the color color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can create & spickshow; enabling only some of the file types to display the program can also display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Using this option for large images the display window will be enlarged on the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Changing the span between the image changes at a slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sliders, or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is placed on 0, the slideshow will be repeated until it gets removed from the user. to change the value, you can use a new value in the input field or use the sliders, or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Here are the shortcut for the different modes of operation of & kuickshow; in the cart-maps short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">This option switch between the two-part view of the filesystems (a window for the subfolder and a window for the files) and the part-part view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large symbols for files in the folder. this display is possible only in the short version.</seg>

<seg id="1334">In this chapter explains how all the features of & AmaroK are explained, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your A-click & AmaroK; control centre. at the top of the window there is a run-text display that reproduces the current current piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bitrate and sample pieces of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of already expired play time to the remaining playtime of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio-analyzers, also under the disk image. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be inserted in two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, the playlist itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows are later added to detail. they provide information on the current piece on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & AmaroK; perhaps you may be noticed that the subwindow start out there. the information presented here are now collected in other parts of & AmaroK; moreover, the information collected in the statistics window can be collected (extras).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the current piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first part in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title you can see the album image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this symbol to tracing the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz icon you will find further information on the current piece. they see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in the context-browser, the cover images may have in the same folder as the current piece. file formats can have any name, but pictures with the word front in the name will be treated. the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this area displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set out which information in the music window will be displayed. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and choose from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the interpreter, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start immediately start playing. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options to add to the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text appears to download the downloaded lyrics for the current piece. once you click on the text box, try & AmaroK; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script runs, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics. the changed version is then stored in & AmaroK; s collector database. this is not a run text script required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The button Find a quest to leave the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interpreters - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping performer / album - First, the pieces will be ordered according to performer and among them there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see connections or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping interpreter / year - Album - Sorted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the standard 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection will be sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer is being ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / Interpret - your pieces will be shown first to the genre, and below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / performer / album - This setting works just as the above, but still sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping completely according to Belieben.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & AmaroK; your collection will automatically detect when you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar you can find a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the complete overview. information about the use of this filter can be found in the section on this manual in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose different periods of time starting from the last 24 hours to a year. of course you can also select your overall collection, which makes the filter practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Download - This lees the current playlist and includes the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1373">To media player, filling the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. further details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter burn / On CD - Dadaquired with the selected pieces to K3b and burned either as a dator or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces) edit... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1377">As a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Uplifting track record - changes as a compilation marked album back into a normal album. the album is then no longer shown among different interpreters but again under the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser shapes the handling of many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligence playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent playlists. these use & AmaroK; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the intelligent playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even self created intelligence playlists are possible. click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list. if you're done, click over. thus, the pieces will be uploaded onto your iPod. if the transmission is finished, finish off & AmaroK; and redeem the treadmill for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar is a search area where you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in file list all the files will be hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file's browser there is an address bar where you can pick music from an integrated URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz input and input box, you can move to music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window square, the hanging of files can be tricky by simple folding. in the case, the holding of the Shift key may be helpful: this will be inserted into the mouse button at the end of the list, and not at the Maule position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist stops all of you to play. you can change the order by typing the entries into the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces are included. in order to reset the filter, press the filter so long the return bar, until the text box is again empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter through spaces separate search terms, & AmaroK; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter for example one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms, search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that one or two or three are included (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for orders, the spaces are included, then include the search term with gether: Mike Oldfield. this way, after entries are sought to include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search point, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50th. this looks for pieces, which have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece which does not contain a specific search term, make a minus sign in front of the search term: -something search for pieces, which does not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these synapshots according to Belieben. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the playensequence of entries by clicking the Strg button, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you can add the button add to which you can add the playlist pieces. on the right next, you will also find playlist, empty and random Mish.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While inserting only must be done (the setup dialog but can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration), will be explained after daily handling of a & CD; to the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, co-encoders and compressive rates and helps you with the right coworker.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and few available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information is lost due to data compressed depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG might have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences are less important as both Kodiers will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still provided with most distributions free but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bitrates.</seg>

<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo plants. today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio-quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide for most people and most pieces of music acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compressive rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex pieces of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more and 256 cbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by teenagers, portable devices and Autostereosystem. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo plants.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually entered or replaced by the program from the freeDB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & caudiocreator; and the Kodiererprogram to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programmes, there are frequently a combination of programs for the Kodierer and these parameters. the manual or the help to Kodians explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: to read on a free database in which people can download audio CDs instead of publishing information instead of text: & CD; titles, artists, names of pieces & etc;, not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Note) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music business can be added. all information can be done in case of a stroll through a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; an active object to choose (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address as well as in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used by the server (This may only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB, geographically it is needed to be used in the nearest mirror-server. this provides bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirrvers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which lelesbian program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that are used to cdparanoia; who wants to know more precisely in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to consider that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution needs to be installed first, if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the borrowed WAV files the Kodierer and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab. other Kodiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoders can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welch Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; console). in doing so, 'lame' needs to be replaced by the name of the code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the installation of device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading disk, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio code of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-by example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD; use '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 Kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which of course you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have a write on it (eg. by trying to copy something into the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & caudiocreator; something that may be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each inclusive & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding coves for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with that to use the freeDB data to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any read of a & CD; change when the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the read-reading programme so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the true device drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, the effective device-drawing can be accessed, so helps a look into the file / etc / flange and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The mapping card of General settings. here, there is not much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything is shown / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information can be requested, so that you will be informed if data is missing to the witness of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The carteicard CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, is a & CD; entry found immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the filename name / filename or tag entries, they can be easily modified and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, further note: if you want to enter everything manually, then disable the selection fields and freeDB is not used. however, this is over 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. to use freeDB in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following cart card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server on the Internet. how does the system, which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put it all as it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the Moedb.org page and look for a mirror server nearby. however, on this path the load between the machines will be distributed. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivocal on the server, as many firewalls will drill the protocol 8880 standard, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surfing the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit any & CD; data to the freeDB server should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp is available on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; out after reading the last piece: cruising this to throw the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: when you cross this cross, then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. this field is not crossed, if only space on a different drive is provided. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything as input as it is in the screenshot. the command is a little long, under circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual-core or quadrant or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to coding more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic establishment of & kaudiocreator; ended. this configuration is being used as a standard for any read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is stored on the hard disk, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will need to collect. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each remote & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD; use the screen photos a little different from the data for a & CD; with successfully removed from freeDB data. therefore, you will learn to manually insert the & CD; data manually, rather than pick them out of the internet. comments are indicated in the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet to happen, now the & CD has to be put into the drive, which was defined in the main window, be insulated.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; be identified and could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD; successful from the freeDB could be picked up successfully, all the songs of the pieces are already filled out and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there, a window will be entered, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the cross-field for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screenshot: the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update', the rest of the data on the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'updating title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidiac per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful withdrawal of the data from the freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name (for example if all words with uppercase letters start or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary sector. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have an unlimited field-length; at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the "tab settings" tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodians and / or file formats. see the code as a code to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obvious to the style of the displayed CD; in this example, this is not important as we do the & CD; data anyway does not transmit; for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are among rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album have already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you typed all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB file. it is already sorted in any of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown on the part list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read. a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece, or pressing the button you select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button Select from the reading process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons on toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet. pieces which have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp-file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example here. did you check if you have a writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing is configurable, the number of parallel processes is unclear. however, the computer used with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem during concurrent reading and code (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from a & conqueror window into the & kmid; window drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bed the button to play in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu piece, or toiling the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically, once you draw it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays out, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song gets too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the Tempoad and so change the recording speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played out, a pressure on the space bar like a print on the button pause, or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece, thus break the playback. bed the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use textiles, others use lyrics and again others. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out what events are to be represented, and even better: the Ereignistyp is automatically determined to activate a song. so if you choose to activate the entry Automatic text list, you will automatically have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set a Ereid type, select from the menu settings the entries of text events or recitals. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarise. these will be played in series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To attach a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find here in the menu Collection under the item Organise.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the same songs as the original songs.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the shelf manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. concerns the if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it has to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button add-in, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece by opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and maintained. this collection will then be added to the continued pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the sequence according to the menu item, the songs are played in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, choose it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button dart right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To make a song back on the other hand, select the button preceding pieces, the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the drawing collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-compatible. in this case the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of Type Change Patch to Bright Piano in Events of Type Change Patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which stores all required terms for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP... END Define KEYMAP... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equalization is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional MKeysTo M is used to put all notes that need this instrument to support the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun powder. to do this, you carry the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun powder) it takes over 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term Tumel patch the patch is meant, with which every sound represents a different percussioning instrument (drums, pellets & etc;), and not the one in which the tone means the sound height of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to form sounds on the Percce Canal. check out the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to create some channels on others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, just make it the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion to have on a certain channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will of course use the name for this channel. if you're using the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, there will be always patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Percce patch on the Percce Canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates which ratio Pitch-bender event will be multiplied with the value n, this will be credited with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only then. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal values are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is required to play a keyboard that is a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find the menu with settings, point MIDI-settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of clavions (one for each MIDI channel). on these clavions, you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view, to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button is not green, but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The edge view has (until now) two different views to show the played notes. view in the menu settings under the point of edge view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) from & kmid; have this happened because & kmid; without Awe support compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, backed & kmid; drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add to & Konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before you need to activate the setup automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to decelerate the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double on the LCD screen.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -working space a & conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, merely in the & Konqueror; window change and the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only, without adding them to a collection, turn off the setup automatic add to the collection and the new; file becomes added to the temporary collection. opening of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.D. first, you just want to play the first file. so make sure to add the setup to your collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock, also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. to all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me to continue to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, send me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracus.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge excitement when you send me a postcard from your residence or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file (if you want to send it) before you want to contact me, as I might have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer, as sound quality depends much on your soundcard. it's not the same if you use a FM-device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had sound card, except that you can of course hear no music.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category durable playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical recording. if you have an entry, his group and all its sub-groups is copied to the current category and the playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlists may also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it by direct editing the XML configuration files, but also by application itself. simply click on a name of a category Cclick, select from the menu view and next editing mode. by the clicking of a subgroup, the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the same with playlists and choose either from the editing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected, without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start-up and moving can be disabled by the Editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer, the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start does not need to be short, it will be automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing during the end-animation however the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation may be the advertisement of a favourite photos: & lt; smiles; & lt; / / / home / koos / mum.gif "fit =" inquired "src =" inquired; & lt; / smilts; In the source package by & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL to be supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider on the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here, the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache's size from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. here is an example of how a 'flash' with the module swamps-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order to play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the MIME type 1 / x-Shockwave-flash can be specified in the setup dialog file mapping of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The queror or & kmplayer; starting in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library. the striped process is crpplayer. if there is no error occurring, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus, a pre-determined backend for a certain MIME type is taken (of course only if this was obtained), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon should reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the scanner must be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>

<seg id="1752">Just like other markers, contains & latex; an introduction, with which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text encoders are defined as well as a box with the text. the introduction contained at least the command\\ 'begin of the document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The fast-entry assistant of & kile; a special function for the quick preparation of a document in & b; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document. it can also be made some of the settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is the type of document displayed: articles (article), book [Book], Letter [Review], Report [DIN) [Prartcl], Report (DIN) [deactivation], book (DIN), projector [proxy], slides [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: with this, the string code is set. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 -coding as standard. in case, UTF-8x should be selected (for correct processing of latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-packages for latex;. for incorporating them only in the cross-field they are compensated.</seg>

LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. latex; change the submission of the document in the following elements (part is the most important and subcutest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and watched by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">If you create your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex files. once an DVI; file [more remote file)] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font, and also other information like the font. there are many tools to view conversion and printing of DVI; -files for various systems and sizes.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the data search, the elements of the DVI; file with the Editor has been shortened and once on an element in the DVI; source code was embroidered. once a section is clicked on a section in the latex; source code is clicked, becomes the corresponding place in the DVI; observer notes.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set up by project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-installation: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (if no errors in the source code exists).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File growth: in this mode, the DVI; file on the dexinationsâ sidelines are deactivated on- and there is no call by & ocular; after the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When selecting the machining toolbar, the three great selection boxes should be developed for the fast and complete common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick outline of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The objectionable & latex; commands for submission are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field is for example of articles such as tags, fox, notes or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection on a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">While sending a quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. during & bibtex; this only works when the file is going to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & b;. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author can also be written in & kile; from hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-box with the name is used for defining the fonts. it can be set by the fonts for the main text, the joints. they are set. the following scriptures are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available for the preparation: 1. the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document art and proof settings. 2. the document may be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays the font. if the fonts are fixed at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has to be entered, the & latex; -source code will be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu, or the quickening installation.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compiler. & b; for the storage is automatically stored.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Closing the compiler of the document, should be searched for the errors in the logging of errors. when using rapid construction should be started & ocular; it is not the case, the log should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment is a text, which is otherwise treated as the remaining document. for example, a report with the font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} can be assigned correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only within the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no description (number) for the changes within a setting.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to create the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, there are certain fonts, fat pressure, curant pressure, submissions, etc., these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {empt}: this command is for the cures and is long as long as he is closed down with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be illustrated with\\ '{word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the latex; sign-speaking language, now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & b;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in assistant a bit of text was typed, a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better legibility of the document. to do this, there should be at least a quote, a few places in fat and spa pressure and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor using Editor-View or CtrE (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window needs to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an extensive file format (engl. D e V ice I nage). these files are created by & tex; or latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then printed the document printed by file (in viewer) (if the printer is properly adjusted).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar set the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the latex; source code was created, the conversion can begin into flagging other formats through the knob in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">To search for the direct leap from the editor to the current position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Cile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. for this purpose only modern is to set up the settings chile... tools which are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to expire the providential search, the mouse-cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text, and fell asleep. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; observer is then processed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this feature in & ocular, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding latex; document of & kile; available and corresponding line. for this there must be set free; in & ocular; as a text editor, set up (settings ocepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should when using quick-installation of the & DVI; spectator, there may be an error. if an error is available, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file invaders the error source in the source code. in the editor you can look at the errors in which the error appears. in order to consider the error message, the error must be clicked on the errors in the log and & b; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose the template for the document. the aforementioned options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting leeres document, a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document. for more information about this is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Business users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, must be either an existing & tex; - / latex; -file created or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by means of drawing up an existing document and selecting file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using the new file, some character chains can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables are set up in settings default... settings can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering documents class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ '$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the following commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then use your own template instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way of creating a template should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and writing of many different types of text files (including ballatex; and & bibtex;). many settings for Kate; can be done in the menu tools directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate; and his possibilities to learn should be attracted the manual too Kate. users of & kiss; you can start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; a command reference which can be accessed by the vehicle's help LaTeX reference. you may find an exhaustive description of nearly all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with mastered Strg button, to rule the & tex; that means that by clicking\\ '\\'\\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\\'.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with engraved linker mouse, the selected text will automatically be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons, you can choose parts of the source code in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Cile; has the opportunity to browse the most diverse types of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can boast one's own type of bookmarks within the text. the menades are highlighted the jumps on the last or last springboard. this ski marks also highlighted the jump, so that in the first input of a sign it is automatically restated.</seg>
<seg id="1816">This is probably one of the main aspects when contacting a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent possibilities for writing a & latex; source texts have been added. & latex; use always many environments and groups and therefore support their selection. under Editing soles are the following commands contained in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Included a complete paragraph (group of rows that included on both sides a blank line). this extended importance is not meant by a text containing the above mentioned tables, latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only indicative thing in & kiss; therefore, that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current currentposition. this selection also has an extended significance, since this command also latex; commands with a valid star (\) and an extra star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example of a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by Druming the button Distrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kiss; offers with own commands, for a faster mixing. under machining, the following commands include as part of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of the soles of the paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been noted that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore provides & kile; for NF other commands under machining environment for easy work with latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, go to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to prepare the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, drawing to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to end the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {Surrounding}, will be sung to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many faded environment commands, quickly the outside view can be lost rapidly. this command slept the most recently paved environment, so that the wiring structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also includes special commands for latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. by editing TeX group are a few important commands that meet from machining.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command leads to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the grazing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will go to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the grazing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor in front or behind the grazing bracket of a & tex; -Group # is, becomes the other end of the group jumped (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many disguised groups-brackets, quickly the outside group can soon be lost. this command slept the most recently paved group, so that the missing structure of the & tex; groups do not dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; they are used for the purposeful implementation in & kile; the sign 'used for two simple application characters. also for the termination of application the character is used. & kile; knows this case and serves two negligible characters for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic shutdown of double the characters can set up under the settings Kile... LaTeX and will be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Many other languages (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">While transitions from Shift; input keys, the current position within a lists -environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is available, not only a pointer but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a table area, slept & cile; the current line with\\\\ with a gracefully reverting direction.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments to support. these can be added in settings, set up... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users open the columns in tables -environments, and thereby all the Et-characters (amp;) and all the Et-characters (amp;); amp; searches & kile; after the most important tabulator in the following line. although this tablet is not the scene-hungry, added & kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code has already been completed, these are in & kile; for special commands (usually, for latex;) still extended. there are three modes available for the automatic distortion. all of these modes can be set up for different working methods with settings chile...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added using the command\\ begin {Surrounding}, automatically the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">In the Dret of the box, the last letter of the input is removed and allows for the complete list. on the other hand, the list can be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameter. alternatively, the descriptions can be followed by selecting a command. alternatively, jumping brands are included, so that an easy jump to these positions can be noted by means of the springboard, and the selected parameters can be upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Below settings kile; set up... khurry; Versions can be made to these lists. there are different ones for the list & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as Whole of the general language used to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the distortion of environments not normal. on the other hand, the environments are often used with ambient temperatures. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the processing of environments to worship.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When you call the full-user mode, the whole old + Shift key, the command to complete the environment is automatically frozen and it does not appear\\ begin. after that, the environment can be completed in the easiest way and by wiring the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Since this is accomplished, the environment will be automatically closed again. once again, realize that it is a lists environment, even a first\\ item command is being frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Below settings kile; set up... khurry; remove all the settings for these lists. this mode uses the possible list of all-time mode, for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1848">Is entered into the letter L by the letter L and the word processing mode, the Meng + Alt blank button, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX character.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large legs are not helpful for the automatic distortion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rators are written more than once in a document. thus, it provides compensation; the completion of all already written ones.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up the settings default... no hurry Versions. here also the sellular value can be specified for the display of completion.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for clearance and rearrangement of pages. the PDF file can be re-arranged, and then the pages are newly arranged with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To watch the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all components are grouped together in the categories to create compiling, converting and converting view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiler of the source text for viewers like & ocular; or the further transformation can be the shortlist of the Alt; 2. then the DVI; file is converted to a HP file by old; 4 the DVI; -file into a PS file, and by old; 5 the PS file is viewed.</seg>

<seg id="2027">This action weighted shortcut. with clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard shortcut; using Keiner is the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in detailed settings and in carrying out the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can change external applications (usually scripts, but this is not limited) to change the document or input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the Schnellstart -dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be stated. example: SH / home / myard / myriad / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripting You Variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is uniquely added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above included methods can accept a script from & quantaplus; to the default one. in the selection field input can be determined to send to standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually recommended only with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the introduced application can be diverted. there are two types issue: normal output, submitted to the standard output; error messages, to the standard output written text should be specified by the value the selection panel issue is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add promotions and configure. select settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action Knopfes at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Simply complete all the necessary fields and add it to the suitable tool toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes, and you plan their use, enable you to process a dialog 'Day when available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignorance! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will & kiconedit; use it from the & KMenu;, graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose your size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting knob as a symbol. by the use of green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -day in the current document will fit.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with settings promotions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue using other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for toolbar or it should adjust this to better overview by some Trenner in several groups. open the toolbar dialog via settings tooling. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trenner support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by making all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its toolbar (s) loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might consider within & quantaplus; -Repository show whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then, you need to create the docrc file. first part we leave you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the document HTML files e.g. php42 / # Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Section1 = Section1 = Sec2.html 1 = spotlight 2.html 2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html Day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation; documentation is something like that:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc yourself = php42 / # top level item = Table of Contents, # Testing Started = Introduction = Action.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own contents. there is no known frontier for the shaft winding (except through reason) mash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index directory is referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the top of the tree-view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The ingredient section is the section of the docrc file which is intended for the design of the context-context sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; script can display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. for context aid the documentation would be directly indicated. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Contacts List) and the file lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of self-rich context-elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your file docrc / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you indicated this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Community. they will not become rich, but proud to have worked in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the stored resources (DTEP packages, tooling with actions, scripts, templates) and others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send via e-mail to friends, partners or other people. at different places there is an email menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus, users can download it. the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as correctly and user-fully prepared for publication, for what it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can choose an exit. in the dialog New resource you need to pass out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking of OK the high load will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high-load can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts, can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not created by & quantaplus, but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files will be necessary in the tag XML format. there's the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD charging and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. afterwards the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directories: the newly created & DTEP, is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition: the string, which is published in! DOCTYPE day, like HTML Public / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first get familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who is & quantaplus; use of tooling over actions is all that is defined as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure tooling, promotions and patterns in the global tree that can then be available to each in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tooling. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be all of & CSS; -patterns to tooling with special promotions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building views, the carteireite with information and the tooling. please suggest you in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the carteies with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document passable entries, like closing the current, other or all carp-rated, recharge, delete or re-load the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Reclashing in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cutting / paste / paste), processing the tag under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, when the string, under the mouse cursor a file is referred.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editors you are the tooling of the Editors. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional acts as standard to which a set of tooling is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbar are adapted to the new features and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tooling is really light. if they want to insert it simple day, for example & lt; then click on the icon which represents the day. now, they can enter the data for this just one day. if they want to insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog various fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with carteireites are available for files, project, sample positions, documents, attributes, and documentation designs.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the steward of files in the project by using right mouse click. actions like Add, Delete, uploading, or Delete of the files from the storage medium can be performed with the right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of finding & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole site & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective user and templates, in projects, can only be used in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send using email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">In this view you can view the internal structure of an active document. through links to a element, the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element. by right-clicking of a element you will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with it, manquickly attributes and namespaces may change. it can be adjusted to the content of all available attributes with just a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc for a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two body-rated at the bottom of the window, about which useful information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carp-rider displays information about each in Quanta current script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document used and all changes to DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carp-rider shows all the errors in the up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus, tooling are comprehensively extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate side of tooling is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as unzipped Tar archive over & b;. if they get a toolbar in an email, they can secure them in & quantaplus, like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus, -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to give a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & b; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & b; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. the same goes for & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for swift web development and combines a matured development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; -editor, the developers started trying to deal with a close idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a peculiar, extensible Markup-Language Editor would be? well, this would make him an absolute greatest web development tool for & kiss; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then there should be & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim to be detained, that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & b; developer's community is based on why someone else has developed? thanks to the & b; -Scst is not only this everything possible but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; thus to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus, allows web invaders to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. through the program compressing them can expand them & quantaplus; expand without getting to remember a scripting language course. (more about it they find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and developed rapidly to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way interconnected with commercial versions of & quanta. the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More information in the details of the details is: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / quanta roll).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervises by Eric Laffine sequencing @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project precondition, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts in insertion from the clipboard there, a special character to & HTML; statement, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting reference.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; notice that the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Unlock the block selection and select from. this allows you to select text messages with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script errors are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window to or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scriptions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"" "" "" "education and turn on the problem of problem at the bottom of the & quantaplus; Hauptfenster. the problem reporter is activated once you change a structural tree." ""</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolcolumn left of the main window. this column permits you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If it prints bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the proceeds of previous or neighbourly, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents will be grouped by the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file. webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialogue on integrating files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory to new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or subfolders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus, the project managed. in Chapter & Quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project-toolbar. these are stored in the project you / toolbar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. these actions only need to set the name. actions need to be added via toolbar tooling, or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the visual range. it does not delete it from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you are asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens up a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of tooling to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you or anyone else did and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / stripped the entities out of the & DTD; it is useful if the entities are going out of the & DTEP; to renew, without the whole & DTEP; to renew it. if this global, and a spelling in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags, which are available in uploaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, the tag menu contains a submenu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus, the inserting using toolbar denies if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins under the menu listed above are listed below. click activated. click on a activated plug-ins deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntaxable mode for the current file. the list of available databases depends on the box; download version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD, by means of an external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. by some restrictions in the KDE library, the switching can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the carp mode, which is also default, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">Additionally, this menu contains an entry. with a selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Turns the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influenced every application that use the HTML-Part, including the & Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judge the behaviour of the Editortoers. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete entries from the tooling, or which will change and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help accordingly to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from the top down, as for example after filling the project called the whole directory-structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. in entering Name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without space-marks with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address that you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol is used. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a joint collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a joint collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. it can be selected multiple files or whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webinations you can download and change. if you want to change it. you have to proceed differently from serversaturized script (e.g. & PHP;) Python, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files are involved somewhere in the main folder of the project, if files are started somewhere in the root level of the project, if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders inside the main folder and you can make an exact choice to be made.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by clicking or, by removing the tick, clinging from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project characteristics in the menu profiles in the subwindow profiles, or with the shortcut Shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (wildcard is possible), which can be re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>

<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles can be uploaded, high-profile profiles (see in) are set, as well as the display of a client-view for the content of the server for each profile, by displaying an own building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window event, one can switch event actions and add these actions, change or delete. events will be executed when a previously particular event occurs, like the sickle of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior is currently not able to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives access to files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, however, lack the entries open and open with... within the right mouse-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select various profiles. the profile contains information about the location of high-up files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be drafted to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in memory and forgot about programing. this possibility is useful if common high load files is needed and the rather unsafe password on the plate can not be found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop transmission or simply exit the dialog if you change your opinion before the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-profile profiles can be uploaded and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, to which files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Transfer protocol for high load. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs can choose.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. password is stored on the plate so it cannot be easily read, but each with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">One project view is just a set of files and tooling. it can be done in a project many opinions, that is, by simple exchange views, various files and tooling can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tooling.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible via settings tooling Project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tooling in & quantaplus; best using the menu toolbar. use and add can be distinguishable. adding tools to be added below in the section section of tooling tool.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be set out either using the right-click menu (right click on the toolbar), it can be set out other actions such as toolbar, toolbar rename or toolbar which results in a dialogue where actions can be displayed on these or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context-text to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition, entries will be removed and action packed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tooling and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tooling... and set up settings options.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentet, code snip and files for shortcuts. & quantaplus; used in principle such as a nasty filesystem with advanced organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move or any of the existing folder into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus, in about the limitations that you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included designs have conditions for their use. please read the conditions performed at the beginning of each template prior to using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binaries are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the pre-site under global templates. further information on the Template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written from any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in the forecasting tree under global templates. see in for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted over again on a template, but the same text area again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the template-tree under global templates. see in for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as a template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out the curtain-tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template store selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with pulling and cast on the manoeuvre.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be applied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and cast, or inserting the file tree by Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right or in the project files building on a folder on the right and secure website template. by default, it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very expedient. you can give headlines and footers or dynamically with & PHP; create files or connect them with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when testing templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / Templates. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder in the template, click on the folder to select the right-click menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is sloped as soon as elterous attributes have creed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the stem folders. if a regular folder would be set in principle, except they would be explicitly activated. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to set up or read text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers and footer for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special headers and footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the right-click menu (show the right mouse button) to add a complete command collection to add folders or copy, and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; -editor and the second, the Editorwindow will divide into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch to the source code editor, in which the changes performed in the VPL; -Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the Vohandision of & PHP; it's not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; -editor. to process & PHP, the source code is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode functions exactly as the first, except that simultaneously changes both in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor synchronized. using F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, the button pressure puts the active cursor from a window to the other, while the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization rate between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; view, one can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the time period can be set. basically, the recommendation applies: a small spaniel for fast calculator and a wide range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; -Editor is possible. the documentation dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor, which is used to transform the hanging coding. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. key words for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added below by drag the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows the modification of the content, e.g. key words on the column name and keywords keyword ked2 on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of designing the drawing of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is as possible as with the meta-elements. editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style setup by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as described in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is behaved as usual. text can be used as usual. text can be inserted through a type of type, and can be deleted by means of taste or removal bar.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be made in the same way over tooling, as in the source code editor, it's to note that the inserting tags before previously existing identical tags are not removed e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded by text, any other surrounding anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tooling such as the tables wizard or the lists-assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists may need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; a tool for the examination of styles are possible. in contrast to other programs for stylesions, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style results can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools about comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had changed many changes while at the same time corrected it in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts trying together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within this line. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps the setup had changed. that, the result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparatively window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the verbose and run by folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way compound is fully supported. this is useful when two people are working independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also with the rest and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; if you are working together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Cdiff3; displays the exact differences and serve them with the possibilities of hypocritical color monitors. if you often need to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no hassle more if Yemen and the setup changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the type of animal work by using only the filename of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "kdiff3" "" "Ordner2" "" "Ordner2" "" "Ordner2" "" "Ordinary" "" "Ordinary 2" "" "Ordinary 2" "" "folder 2" "" "folder..." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows the manual type of file names, the selection on the file browser (file...) or the selection of a recently opened file from the box. opening dialog appears to specify your selection and displays them next time. you don't have to specify third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the distortion is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & diff3; the filename from A to the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If combined, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file immediately. you can do this step later on store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup-button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison will start immediately. in Open dialogue, you do not need to select files you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and cast off: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains such a similar effort. if you want to find out how similar to these features, it would be a relatively large effort. you would only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; you can easily copy, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you can't pull nothing from & kdiff3; only the subject of text in a comparision window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and cast off text into another program as cutting and Pasting (instead of copying and Pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each word window is the info line. the info line from the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the index number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info-line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while above the line. then, a small bailable window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see on the color that file differs. if both files differ, the default colour is red. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's next section (lead) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text there is the abstraction column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programmers where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the procession and in few, rare instances.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that divides the abstracts column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the pointer is activated, the line is shown to the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative edition) also has a info line with the booklet issue:, the filename and [geography] if you have processed the result. usually it contains through the automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons springe to find the most detached / unresolved conflict in order to find even remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the column is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also be a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted the color scheme for current area and each other on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or by manual do not have any line left in the group; then it is indicated in these lines of the text; it is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you might copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; introductions conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this feature around.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the options to ignore the options numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This is mainly navigated with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you use in one of the windows, you can use the arrows to the right, beginning, end, Strg-beginning and Strg end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the surname column next to the vertical capsidebar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augabewindow you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between one and overload mode. (default, the insertion mode)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns will sync the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already described in paragraph and declared the editable window display).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Strg-image downward / Strg-image downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image downward) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, it has to be considered conflict between solved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to press the Copy -button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically copied into the clipboard and dislocate the manual copying. be careful with this option but you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Pointers are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix-variants use a pointer sign-sign\, and Win32-based systems use Wageningen + Zeilenvorbox\\ r. Kwi3 keeps the drawing line of source files not with, therefore you should use & Cdiff3; also not with binars.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files is automatically saved, and restored when the next start is restored. (menu Constellations- &gt; Kwi3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog presents also writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in recursive script are shown. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colours, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be wiped out. on these systems the button-settings is automatically an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, when pressing the tabulator button, the appropriate number of spaces are inserted. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you express or return the input of the previous row will be automatically used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. manually copy the manual into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which pointer type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While the comparisons of files tried & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares any line. in this step white characters are not ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon string '\' at the end of a line, others only store a pointer '\' in the end of a line, others only store a pointer sign, but as a white sign be treated. while connecting, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after still looking for smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic-routing mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need it from time to time, then use better the functionality voters A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts resulting in numbers or comments when the options numbers ignore or ignororize C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and throughs of merging. see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merger.</seg>
<seg id="2337">When a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is the Suffix .orig. if there is already such a backupfile with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further assurance.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of user interface. you need to stop & diff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is adjusted global over the Control Center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding appears a short note of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding is adjustable for each file individually, can be compared and assembled by different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code should be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not be able to function with your codec, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII. with this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress lines of changes in white characters in the text or review page. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options numbers ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. according to selecting A & lt; s; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -ed; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second surest column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. you simply click the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window side by side, or overeach other. this can also be useful for viewing of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merger and uses the filename of the final source file as preset name for output file. (when this function is used to reboot the file, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that correspond accurately to your needs. you can use this function e.g. to cut disturbing parts or correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command (see above), then the command of the command is given to the input command. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. each entry line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however an external program is needed, and most users want to program that not themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl are fully sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processor command to convert the input into uppercase letters: sed's /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This is therefore all characters in one line.\\ 1 in the ertification string, refers to the found text in the first gear pair. the\\ U converts the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generate character chains (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). *\\ $/\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ ftor\\ _ BAR _ user\\\ '\ _ BAR _ user\\\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with dressed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kapp3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for pointer. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hand is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like e.g. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, perl requires some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the preceding'\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and to merge. further operations only change the data, which sees the pointer-algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the pointer process will see the version of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The procession commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst event.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare with & diff3; complete folder recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate that simulate and shows the simulated changes without it really carry out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... derive selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merge from individual files very similar. you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three files are gathered together, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder was specified, it used & diff3; folder 3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not to merge it. to run it, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During boarding the folder you will receive a small message window on current progress. if you break scanning the folder, only the files are listed, that were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and a folder that was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can double-click on the + / - click on the + / - click the arrow buttons, or by folding the arrows for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories, folders and view all subdirectories that you can charge all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file will be started immediately and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the interconnective action may not be automatically chosen. if it will run together, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their overall content is identical. then you have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant to its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leafy, which is only green, then yellow, and later when it is old, is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, extinguishing the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the objective, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (such as A folder and B): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, that can't run together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (such as A folder and B): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, that can't run together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchronized, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folder are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B; directly after the output copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folder are assembled and selecting the new file instead of merging (unsafe), then analyzed & diffusion: files are different, but the same date appears, then the exact date appears, but the date is identical.. if such errors will not be eliminated, the files can't run together.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During which collapse a file is processed after another. it status-column signifies skill, when it coincide, and according to other notifications when something unexpectedly came up. if that comes together, you should make a final review and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the dialog dialog, the file comparable analysis is selected, Kwi3 further columns will display. these contain the number of unresolved, solder, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for redeemous conflicts is only displayed when three folders were compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can combine either the selected entry (File or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all interconnective actions (even in all subfolders), you can bring it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specified the target folder, then the three-folder mode is used as the target, in the two-folder, B is chosen as the destination and used for synchronizing A and / or B as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries should be the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options passing by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasantly surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To run all entries: choose directory-together / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to run only the current entry: select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types there still exist invalid actions, a message appears on the faulty items. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you run all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options transmissions, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then it opens up a composite window (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again directories / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next post.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you'll see some error messages that may help you to choose the cause of the problem. so, you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed together.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually circulated, this entries (in the current session) and brings them together at the later collapse of all entries. even if this has been skipped up or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries are once again brought together.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kwia set up...) now has a section called directory-merger with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree; multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folder do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary-tree; it can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary-tree; it can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be submitted specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see at info: / cvs / cvsignors.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a distorted point. in other filesystems, a file can be hidden as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary-tree or not. this option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folder: when the option is switched off, the links are turned out. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively. a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a finer loop, and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text. (insert an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder about a slow network, it may be faster, just change date and file size. however, this speed test will cost you a certain level of security. please use with caution. this option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the familiar date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they're equal to the same. for example, it can be useful when copying the changer date. please use with caution. this option is unfolded in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals for connecting files are identical. also, the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered uncertain as it is assumed that the other file is not also changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .original. if an old backup file already exists with .tg extension, it will also be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal composite of individual files, not just the collapsible folder. this option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-together view is visible at the collapse of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option folder & text window to switch main window in the window menu and switch off between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, you can connect a single file by double-clicking. so once you save the result, the status file will be completed and the file will not be combined once you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost if you read the directory again: list menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network more transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this for reading files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archivs with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder is shown. then a file is assumed as a link goal. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the change date from the original. (note the option in size.) (This is only possible in local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of purpose is currently used as differences of observer in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences. to launch Ksten3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in Kwi3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a cage file, the input file is a patch file in Unified format. then, the input file must exist in the Unified file. then, the names of the original files must exist. then it starts & diff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kwi3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that merge or the concord of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (well, it is compare) already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 points already pointed out that it can bring together like the program diff3 from the slide tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot that I looked at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or get it like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and do not notify the correct Prefix to KDE. in the default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more detailed information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines defile the next to each other, this resis, but this is the case on the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is much effort to create extra a file format that might store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process more quantities of text should be used another editor.</seg>

<seg id="2446">(in the current version you have to read and read the folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are shown to have the differences. this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder. if the target directory contains these files, it is likely to be copied after that. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on selection of the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window is attached to the end of the selected group in result window (if they are not already there). if the lines already exist, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. undershoots in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmoustaool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse-cursor is hardened a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people to emulate the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmoustaool; can handle the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse, and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also cause pain that is related to your computer using your computer, should you seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to make it even more clear: even if & kmoustaool; pain helps to arise when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the case of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic armaments, the result may be different for each of them.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmoustaool; is simple: & kmoustaool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click out as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart script is activated, makes & kmoustaool; a pause after it emitting the mouse button emulate. now move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before the slogan of the mouse is executed. this way you can carry out the mouse with pressed mouse-button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you quickly get used to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time-time must be petrified after the end of the mouse movement before & kmoustaool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent it is switched on, the script becomes different (1 / 10 s) active. here the time is adjusted, the & mousetool; after downloading the mouse button wait before it leaves the mouse-button again, if there is no case for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmoustaool; now supports the clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow cycled to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can later be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can shorten the response time; open the reaction time to shorten the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider Sound buffer to shorten you down a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">This setting is marked, is set & kmoustaool; at any start by & kde; at the moment this feature is only available under & b; available at GNOME or other window frames, please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2509">The best use you & kmoustaool; initially with preference. in particular, the intelligent mains you should first have turned off. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later be able to push the smart slide.</seg>
<seg id="2510">When you use the audible click, it will be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or on positions in the browser window, which does not constitute a link, does not cause unseasoned reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse rests, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can clean only the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse ball. as that happens, from mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily scrape you with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmoustaool; if just a different date has been started. if in this case you use the intelligent expeller, this means that the mouthmoustaool; the operation cannot end more through the release of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmoustaool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this will be reset to the status of & kmoustaool; and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmoustaool; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but do not park your mouse on a neutral area of the working surface, if you want to create a keystrophy. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are more secure. secure zones for the mouse-cursor and menus and the cover-lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intellect, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmoustaool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text to copy it into the clipboard and to re-insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there will probably be some advice here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent moving not only if you're just starting to begin your mousetool; instead, mark the mouse button below and hold down the Shift key, while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and enter the mouse-button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is the mouse button pressing a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the intelligent moving the different time begins. later you can use the intelligent expelling also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmoustaool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; this should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and loudspeaker and are furnished them correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& Cmoustaool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor is short-hardened. this program was designed for people who suffer the RSI syndrome and which the toiling of the mouse were hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmoustaool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a target process begins before the mouse button is left. in this way can also drag the pulling and cast off with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text will be edited before he will be sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to select false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and spokesman or to avoid certain deficiencies of language niizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will proceed to all other orders and keeps those orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the requested orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this step is important news such as & eg. processor becomes too hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders will continue after the edition of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can see with & cmouth; someone who just enter the room. & kiss; notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text messages. each order you need from the Carteies orders is a text job. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text messages. text calls are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & ktts; just one such pre-reads, this edition is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; messages are applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the visualized parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) um & XML; convert from one format to another format. included in the scope of space; are some XSLT files to translate the translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker connectors, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or subject to the program, which send the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice for example, you can read text of KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter does not apply, he does not specify the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a box; sent to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters made in the page below. processing through the filters takes place in the sequence in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2639">Enter your filter a name for your filters. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the character chains in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column. the list is displayed in the sequence from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you can see the Satzbounded filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a result of a propositional filter filter. you can change its settings, or add more Satzbounding filters, beginners will not come out of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the furnishings of the speaker choices by trying out. turn off on the carteicard orders, which speaker & ktts; choose. place the speaker selection once again, change some properties and check how the selection of the person has changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the pre-reading can begin since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">They then can stop or break text orders on the carp card, even if the language resynthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional filter will automatically set up when you start the tsmelgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only be removed. change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzbounding filter compare text with a regular expression of proposition and add a tabular character (decalcode 8) to the proposition. (tobacco) are automatically removed from the filtering above the text). note that the standard punctuation filter does not retain the string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied on & kde; -messages (cold), warnings, messages or output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from seeing the normal Satzbounded filter, you can insert this once again by load the file _ sbdrc file standard.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the carpart map, you can write the spokesperson for the application. the carteicard is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default language (the top one on the cart card). in other words, there are no spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable person, which shows all the features of the microphone. if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the speaker. otherwise he chooses to select this speaker. otherwise, he / she chooses to be the speaker that is the most sought-in properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired spokesperson by clicking on one of the selection heads.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the features of the desired person. if this feature does not play a role, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this event, if the property needs to be prioritised over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority feature. the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language is ahead, if you know that a particular application text appears in a different language other than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field of spokesperson, which is most likely to delete, click on the default tables, and then use the spokesperson listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is in queue for the last text box. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the entry is 0 necessary).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes down when it is started. I have debug Debug support but I don't get any feedback.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and cilts; it was finished. probably you have to register GSTREamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it may not be a compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or install GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over alsa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & ktts; a message appears on the console; appears a message that says: to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts with algae occur, which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Alsa project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed them and can use it at the festival, ttsmelgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / Note / Get the new voice. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the carp card audio there is a setting speed. in order that this works, the program needs to be installed and over the ambient variable PATH. some synthesizerommods such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; prereads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are completely courageous, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -after-SSML-Performerfilters, and put the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I didn't manage that web pages will be read with a female voice. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At the Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable Gender does not seem to work, the xsl file uses for converting SSML to Saber the gender-tags. the same also applies to the Voice tags.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; a module for the & b controlcenter; which enables the management of network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings allows.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & Cocontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be invoked by selecting K Menu Tcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & Cnetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way, like other settings from the & b controlcenter; enabling the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & b controlcenter; displays. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & Tnetworkconf; network hardware is not necessary to install. physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed while installing and installed. network devices are added later, the drivers have to be loaded by adapting the following files, corresponding to the core version, loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the & b controlcenter; -index selected is selected. when starting the module network settings, this, the platform used in the system can be automatically recognized.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the hanging selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best suited. by marking the setting non-again inquiries, the definition can be taken permanently. in the next start of network settings, this selection will be automatically set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, meaning that the settings can only be considered, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can click through clicking the button management system mode at the bottom end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used for managing network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Reiter network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings in line network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog tool set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button below shows the dialog with ongoing possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting machines, TCP / IP settings are fetched by a DHCP Server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode, TCP / IP Information is provided with each system start, therefore no further adjustment is required. in the selection list may be either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">You can set the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet will be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is marked, the system initializes the network interface in the boats. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on a switched network device is checked by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the machine in the local sub-network that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface present on the computer, the interface needs to be selected, where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org, the DNS replaces this name into an IP address, such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The computer name for namespace part of the rider's naming solution allows an easy management of this list. entries may be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a trader and executing or demotion in the list with the buttons, or storing in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button you add... from the group calculator to the namespace can be added to a DNS server. it will be added to the New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button add. the entry then is inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator you choose an entry and then click "Edit.... It will be shown on the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The lists specifically known calculator describes calculator-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNA-server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. these are still going to be analysed in the test version of IP is to replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... The dialog New Alias will be added.</seg>

<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name-known machine from the list and select Edit.... the dialog of acquaintances will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, must be placed in a & console; the following command must be reset.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is confuse http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient, if & kde; and qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and in a single console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphically surface such as a package or the installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & b; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things is required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile it. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology will be given, in the second section are all discussed by & networkconf; changeable Configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on integrating the PC into a small (home) network can be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated by TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found big spread. from IPv6 it is expected that it continues in the near future. this description is therefore currently focused on IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP-address of a network interface is available. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workplace is the contact-administrator which is available or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0A; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the standard route is required for IP-transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files, which are located by & Cnetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, there is no other content than specified there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& nbsp; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. the first aim was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking. the second goal was the answer to a question which my wife provided: how much longer takes it when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it has to be involved from & kdate; it may be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& nbsp; Giult the band back and reads the pre-voltage information of the Bandes ein. realize & kdate; the lecture on the band is not, you are asked if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat files; the prefix, it searches for the right index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the bandindex is to be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol is changing for the belt drive to show that the belt was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the banker may now be searched out by executing the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before picking up the bank, first must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& nbsp; there is a change in the symbol for the tape that the involvement for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be thrown out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat files, it has to be formatted by & kdate; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you need to be used to store data. this operation does not correspond to the formatting at & kdate; it must happen before you get formatted before using the tape. floppy belt drives usually put a formatting of the bank advance, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & nbsp; with the formatting of the bank. all the data on the tape will be lost automatically! after completing the formatting, the volume is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you switch to the backup process, you need to select the secure files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file. it will only be backed by this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose to be sent to the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings will open for securing. in this dialogue, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears backup. the dialog shows the progress of the process of safety, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or the folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. there are only the marked files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the audit process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialogue, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears over. this dialog shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data flow and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can re-establish the Restore, the files that are to be recovered, marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the belt drive. it will only be restored the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. it will only be restored the marked files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose to reconnect in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings for restoration. in this dialogue, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for restoration, the dialog appears re-manufacture. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindexfile on the basis of the band's content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can regenerate the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This provides a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of secure files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under backup files, is that only those files are stored in the same file system, such as the folder. folder, which lie on other filesystem, you can add separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is saved. it will only be saved files that have since changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to establish changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling the tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are stored; and lt, heals; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item on KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to non-recurrence version of the bandman.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmits & kdate; before the band is involved, the command will be mt load to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries & kdate; to unlock the throw at the belt drive. possibly this option does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the loosening of the integration of & kdate; automatically the volume is ejected. use this option not with floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kering; the hardworking block size for the belt drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this attitude is active or not, you have to let & kdate; in any case the block size for your belt drive can be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & nbsp; one volume formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is calculator: seconds, where calculator of the complete name of the system is, on which the volume is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat files.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup. this symbol is only active if a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & b; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where to obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. in addition, the system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& quot; log; helps users understand what makes your computer working in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where to receive information about your system or where the system puts the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access for example on information about issues that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some extended features, with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystems log; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, displays & ksystemlog; functions at your disposal, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the system is trying to open & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protector. will not display it, and it opens instead of its small news window, so you have the protocol files under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar to filter a distinctive criterion, or after the filtering strings. in the default setting, the selection range is displayed next to the filter file. then a log-line will be displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search box is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. the string of the filter search box will then be selected only with the entries in the selected column. select the name of a process in the protocol file system, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent to you which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the major protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a catching color as protocol lines of level notice. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on-hand dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use Filterbar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to jump new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage the menu. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information on the catchment sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: music file; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts at the construction of the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to address historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binder is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was a one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you would like to start installing the system or switching to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as settes, which will only once run. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand beneath / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not own this file, even if there isn't much use for it. you can also create a rc.on / etc / rc.d if you want to run something that has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init in different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have brought something through the inittab, then you can fix it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you don't find the right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stopping init actually system services? quite simply, each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be called on the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could also have a user -Runlevel, which is & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; using a mouse or another line device is simple to say not trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position), so this will only happen if they have an entry from the area of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted if you move them into a new range. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of entries before you once again try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different work areas (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually modify the sorting number or the name of an order, enter the input button to change the properties dialog. use the dialog button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, it will be restored by & ksysv; modifications to preference are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine will start constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Give the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I made some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not running.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary furniture programs in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by each system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just finish without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save it. either, use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry store in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; it is a simple application. the main window consists of two carp cards, the user and the user list. to edit the user, select the user, or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it will be the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some carp cards are only shown if you have set up extended system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (Quota) for users, a carp card will be created where shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Password Password administration appears when Shadow Passwords or etc / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This carteicard appears only if applicable to at least a built-system file system (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quotas group on the filesystem). here you can change the parameters for each user, whereby the restrictions on data are stored in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with space constraint with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The carpart card groups informs about the group belonging of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the great field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select "Add to the user" menu or group or click the appropriate add -button of the toolbar. editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, remove the boat password, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
