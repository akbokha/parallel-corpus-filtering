although I had visited the US at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely large .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have danced to American music , American authors have read and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me , that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican &apos;s letter , which was covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who was the highest federal court with judges , who were incl@@ ined to fill his interest .
I was caught .
free to meth@@ od Man , &quot; me it was as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about xen@@ ophobia and racism .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as it goes with its narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , African American and women .
nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number , ever reached by the Party as a candidate .
I was spee@@ ch@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not dump Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world takes up a deeply sad@@ der person with whom I was talking about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ umps &apos;s world@@ view did not agree with the director of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
little intolerance also stands also in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr whose life struggles long the environment and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those through them em@@ bo@@ died my love for America .
while tr@@ ump his way to nom@@ inees to nom@@ inees to nom@@ inees , they offered me a stop and the object to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of its cont@@ emp@@ t towards the non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people have voted for dre@@ ump because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to overlook these things , I almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
to order people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of which are white for dre@@ dging because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . WC . : so much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearing the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in touch on wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash what as much means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sk@@ id@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it called the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like always , America is definitely welcome .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of an Ken@@ an , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise , saying , The Hell with manifold , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word of speech with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a onom@@ y strong &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; dis@@ missed the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a single and onom@@ at@@ ingly strong &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find space in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
the music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music Association ) has now been playing a sym@@ ph@@ ony sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI .
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laughing and play with shiny eye and play in the turbul@@ ence you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , p@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga to play .
music from the garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with play@@ back instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling es under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have started to turn parts of the apost@@ asy into instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ated viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , bass guitars , guitars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet , and percussion , all produced out of the trash .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher for the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , something which he had never seen before : one from the dra@@ in violin .
today there is an entire orchestra to play on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that called The Count Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance at :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest nations - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before the Franzis@@ kus :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already been operated in li@@ ber@@ ian waters illegal fishing , before it was ra@@ ging the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised in this way and less incl@@ ined to welcome a lo@@ bre@@ cher of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves swiftly against the ship . they eliminated him , one of its har@@ b@@ ors and refused to give him a fishing force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a director of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who were then driven from their waters at that time .
&quot; in doing so , we have eight countries who are in@@ minded and working together . they trade information out and stand on each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is being captured is hidden , so because it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing for regions .
through the inten@@ tional dis@@ respect of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate equilibrium .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions today occur in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port infection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite television .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - including such susp@@ icious driving routes , such that indicate that a ship will load his captured fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a c@@ anti@@ virus , where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a Stra@@ fre@@ er .
countries who are against illegal fishing can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that their ships cannot sell their cargo . and that even the numbers of pen@@ alties can even be forced , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial loss for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is not profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a couns@@ elling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to withdraw valued 20 million USD to lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing for the region and continues to attract commercial fishing from all over the world . by these well @-@ known illegal fishermen .
among other practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit Lic@@ ens@@ papers , indication of fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could be illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you dar@@ ed my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations into des@@ demon@@ ic ships since its inception was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
there has been criminal networks uncovered , which had counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has followed whis@@ pering ships and found them .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise .
photo with friendly permission from F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to det@@ ach the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishing use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s why we are trying to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be contracted by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to help crimin@@ ally ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oce@@ ana . a platform that offers satellite television and can be displayed around the world by means of the position of each individual trac@@ eable ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system per@@ mitting the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , but they also sc@@ are deter@@ red .
ships who have formerly un@@ locked without a license and barely had to reck@@ on with consequences , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now accounted for a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses ever since .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia , had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board smug@@ glers networks , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission from F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , so called the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With certainty the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures also in other regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country had report his first major triumph in October : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road and tow@@ ing networks were used , which is now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they continued a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

the road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into void by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the colon@@ isation of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in central Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in central downtown Mé@@ rida and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the impe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the dra@@ inage of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes place in her latest article in the context of the Government of Government :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and violence has been estimated to be the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

on Twitter , pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news of police oppression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and the armed support of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country some demonstrators ch@@ ained to hold the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ als don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , there is already an info@@ graphic the round , which forms the scale of repression a day :
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister@@ ial procedure , which has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many inn@@ umerable people on the street .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs adds :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your impe@@ achment !
on the road !
others use these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , who has done little against the devastating economic crisis in their sight , and would rather let critical voices con@@ ti@@ fy :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ zol@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or to go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is presented here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba .
in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden , the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
34 years he held the family secret for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was right .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and murder@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ zer . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose one way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you friends with one of the ERP .
pass only on that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionaries &apos;s army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; party .
that is why he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything from it was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket wrapped bag and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were placed and taught me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted in an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ y in and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on man .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
it rarely has a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to bed , over@@ shot it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the stand there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , he came the same smell from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another person ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and they were joining .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people stood with the face down@@ ward - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the proximity of the entrance to the entrance , people still rely on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw among the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ddle thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I purchased &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told me at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man together and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
the following video runs Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ ks@@ chambers .
the way in which you came here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then cr@@ acked for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be displaced .
this was the lie , the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the endu@@ ement of man and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things at home .
back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was on the military even when I was there - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war cl@@ ut@@ ors are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military water@@ marks that one takes on an enemy which is fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war @-@ mare , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my Father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you looking for cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and shou@@ ted :
if you go so far , I will find you and bring you stubborn .
we need no one else to do this !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of at that time I had a jacket and a wheel swe@@ ater from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been accused of his crimes . I did not refu@@ te , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to declare .
&quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot;
now , where I get older I find repent@@ ance .
I have children . once you have children , one sees the value of a lifetime .
one develops further and re@@ alizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted them during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children perform ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
had these people not also families where to pass their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they hol@@ lowed machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and disp@@ osed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything of course still remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
the thought of showing my father was taken during a talk , when he was under house arrest .
I did an accus@@ ation because of all the atrocities that I had to experience .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt safe and wondered what the whole over@@ arch@@ ing patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I called :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he rep@@ lied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then p@@ enn@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just that did I do .
in 2010 I restore the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can dict@@ ate me that I was taken . I finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , still at the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including heavy , un@@ lawful freedom of imprisonment in 15@@ 8 cases , murder in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death succession in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can prolong his license .
the photo was shared in social media .
edited the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers were opened to a newly opened center in which one can leng@@ then his driving licence , in the last month witnesses a particularly mis@@ con@@ sensual translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; mistak@@ enly - but maybe also with wicked back &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
arrangement of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also who pointed out the local time .
the published daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by reasonable if not entirely correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation error . furthermore , they explained that the mistake had already been included in the text they had been checked by the translator and that the translation was not tested for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely appreciate that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News put a bit more extensive with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan , and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the share of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents , but are definitely cause for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of which caused a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors seniors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of accidents caused by the elderly has risen in the same period .
the name of the named repor@@ ters brought comments to the light in the published version of Article comments to the light which shows which prejudices some Japanese apparently circul@@ ated against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo with the translation errors was among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I do not think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finding @-@ mine for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo from Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ take two important skills : passive voice skills to understand the starting text and an active language skills to transmit it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - mother tongue .
thus , a French native speaker should translate into French as an example from English into French - not by the French translation into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms do not employ employees with English as a native language , the translations into English . this may be mis@@ guided by understanding , cost reasons or relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have a foreign employee , do not release any other company internally . then the Japanese employee , whose translation will be considered the best , for translator - no matter how good or poorly his language skills really are .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and pu@@ zz@@ led sentences are created by machine translation , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator . this applies to some languages quite especially .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling dru@@ g@@ prints , which often t t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to read or even understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable to a jewelry or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the Internet and television take to
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users who had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet portal of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will no longer be available .
other online broadcast@@ ers recorded images of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who ref@@ utes the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court had dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court of Justice .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is folded , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ elan Provider are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of turmoil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 in reporting protests . at that time , the Commission started to report on them with fin@@ es and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have signed up to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that it is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT film confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly exceeds its meetings .
previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had yiel@@ ded that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNA . it is a technique that will respond to the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied boarding on the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ per@@ ched channel , the transfer was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ camera Elvis Elvis Flor@@ es , who took over the protests in Caracas , was put into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in a police @-@ ha@@ ke .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on to show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : so the Venezu@@ el@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events is still further complicated .
in Paraguay many girls will get to slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today Tina it &apos;s fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimonials of other cri@@ b who have been the same as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report from Kur@@ d , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission from the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ish cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her degree gradu@@ ation at the university she returned once again to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those from which something has become &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one den@@ otes more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money handed over their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children need to do so many days of house@@ work that will never be paid and being victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract that you cannot raise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was widely used as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a couple of years for an organization which fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls who were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witnesses , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to name things in the name , because the sense of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated against cri@@ b is generally silent in general .
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and make something out of themselves &quot; for another family .
on the other hand , the family that occupies the girl with himself and justi@@ fi@@ antly justify its exploitation by faith , that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not be a training , and maybe even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is married , his family will experience only a lot of years later .
sometimes they even learn about it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon found in the Hidden in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy hits . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the residence .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in late January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira provided with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ b@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest , and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows than children are registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 Civili@@ an organizations called for a high @-@ level examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will be brought to judgment .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ming in which her father worked , she had to register and lost her father his work .
their brothers had to go all of them and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday for instance clean@@ se the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more spare time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a said she had to never star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the good@@ man as eating out of the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the good@@ man , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the landlady Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition @-@ related such as &quot; Sen@@ ca@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime &apos;s regime .
he indeed held her for intelligent , but did not talk with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; you allowed me not often to visit my family because they think I would learn &quot; bad habit . &quot; in doing so they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ í , at home again their native Guaran@@ i .
their Lord fears that they were the education they had allowed to lose , she explains .
but she was very clear , however , that for everything she got from them , paid with their hard work .
also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils that are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t want to invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group .
isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group in which you can see advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .

legis@@ lature writes Egyptian user social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published by the Public Domain C@@ C@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed to a bill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on behalf of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to make use of social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is in charge of giving citizens a permission to give social media .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and staff numbers in order to make use of social networks .
if it failed to do so , this could bring a punishment from up to six months in prison or a fin@@ ite .
the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ings and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as an &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ de use , which is running through the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video teaching and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft does not have an indication of how Egyptian authorities should make use of the user , which does not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the statutes , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a us@@ ername and a password saved by the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this might mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on the ground are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( on German &quot; leader &quot; research @-@ technical &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have a lot of doubt about technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control violent public and private spaces it could be done online .
when I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to assign them to a judicial process .
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative committee and the Constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no dis@@ sent@@ ing Nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k struck a legislative campaign against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those intended to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ species from the larger family of leop@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are characterized by Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find always less prey , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining boot@@ y in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on that a big rob@@ bery is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually is low in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video makes it hard to make a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure pleasure .
as a trained Biolog@@ in , R@@ aza passion@@ ately passionate about another side of their country which is not only made up of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the advances that have been reached in the past six years in order to re@@ construct the lives of those who had been affected by the &quot; Trinity catastrophe &quot; from March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Pre@@ fecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Pre@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a real Pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring buildings Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ asig were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish whole coastal cities of the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , already by that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper comprises both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those affected themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asig
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( dates back to , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asig .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
Iw@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , one still tries to settle for six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated of pers@@ ist@@ shel@@ ters ( dates back to , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 thousand people saw themselves forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ates lived in such persever@@ ance .
almost 40 percent of the world &apos;s evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones who were shel@@ ved following disaster shel@@ ters were settled in final houses .
for Iw@@ ate , the figure is here at 34 per cent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected positions .
as the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could detect , have 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their pas@@ sions were opened until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ect structures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing volumes in Iw@@ asig and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now returned in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing boats have been re@@ recorded in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have drawn up into compassion .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of farm@@ land in Iw@@ asig , and less than 50 percent of agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima could be used again .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima lie in the &quot; nuclear waste zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered over again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still falls far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asig is back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ dwell@@ ers , it can feel more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to find an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and how her ou@@ rage has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction of the article the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population of experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed said that this was still not done enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es .
as it is for those who have to ev@@ acu@@ ate those from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
in her expenditure on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Sun@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , catastrophic , nuclear accident that the Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160 000 evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people , returning to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in lasting spare parts .
after the date of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their native pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster area , most of the evac@@ uation tests are most of the evac@@ uation ones who still have to rec@@ laim more than 50 years . they have to compete in correct Beh@@ aus@@ ungen . this is building projects , the part of the Olympic Games are to take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries that speak another language , the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities .
after a while , however , it is often possible that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode from In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment they have felt very strongly related to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how love for music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma , after it has been crus@@ hed by the police on national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a wide widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had struck him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a cr@@ unch against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions .
doctors performed him this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
in the pictures the face of police officers is also identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been tac@@ kled by the active service of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers , as he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be audi@@ ted by a prot@@ esters and landed on the intensive care station , his face would see six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by police officers and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also reflected in social networks .
in the clip below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus as of the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , which lives in another state of state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ jan Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow its family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was divided multiple times in social networks .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he has joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked in the intensive care station after it has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has attacked him with a stroke stock .
police transfers
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police movements against demonstrators last Friday .
polic@@ emen were protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to refrain from violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report to Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media prot@@ esting again , by pressing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a break@@ able glass window to shape with a photo their cover pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand @-@ placed bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a continuous wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this also needs to recognise if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , un@@ proportionate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are decei@@ ved by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters onto the confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar mills in all Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no doubt that there are no appreci@@ able sugar @-@ harv@@ ested on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the earth the sugar industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the rum@@ st of steel and concrete remains .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some have rarely changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ated and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry does not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are factories in the east of the su@@ ro@@ hr@@ factories that are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
it was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry has already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar was produced , less than the 1910 produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is no news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway line of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 @-@ sugar mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production factor was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the 2016 report , &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; from the OECD and the FAO , the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the crude oil would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day certainly enters into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
during the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar door factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , says the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents were in the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
so that the place will receive , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first lock@@ ers , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which would be removed merely concerning the parts being removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could author@@ ise any acceptance .
from then on , the responsibility has been handed over and the letters were becoming more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the breastfeeding factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the factories in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the down@@ time of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved .
with each part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work@@ c@@ eries were er@@ ased .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut talk of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the people who were present to present people who were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the cost of the population for closing the sugar factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by the load .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me learned that many things change , but not always for the better , when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane closed , or better said than they began to settle them off , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted this also disadvantaged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
you have got to spare parts .
without the perspective of the perspective , many young people settled in the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
by the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty awakened the old soldiers a number of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to retirement in the retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no thoughtful person , but still gives the lies that you told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes through 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Youth use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and to maintain their own culture
a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations Communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , since 2014 the workshop leader mobile Ton@@ studios run directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video @-@ production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in north @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ Communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars worked together .
the workshop thus rises that the young participants in discussions topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ ebo@@ x First Nation , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always control the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has been recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gives them a St@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available to the St@@ rop@@ he , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in my interest .
but I try to go on Earth my days on Earth
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way of life
yet I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad living
this is how they can grow and also advance our youth
that is how they can do what it controls the Creator .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are near the entrance to the entrance , &quot; Plas@@ tische Mod@@ els of the courts &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts .
in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes that were documented by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his movie Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic courts are so common that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend , however , turns them in show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic fired phone lig@@ aments , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu &apos;s department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y , like in this case , fri@@ ck@@ ie mag@@ ine :
here are a few Sho@@ dd@@ les cooler magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ es is increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile @-@ style .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone rings .
we also made this part in Tokyo at the Tokyo train station .
and here is an apple that handles your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of a growing flight into com@@ ic .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ estrogen is used , a favourite dish that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can dis@@ guise my cell phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone @-@ hing@@ es has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ belts made of dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # in the de@@ pu@@ ties .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the city of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic bu@@ cks are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of foreign and foreign media above the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trafficking in Mexico , the susp@@ ens@@ aries and gear@@ boxes regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle takes place .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a box , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the hearing or the communities that have learned to live with pain .
in doing so , behind each bone fund , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories are numer@@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking will learn &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and telling stories of people who are in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities have to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk .
the angu@@ ish of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) relates precisely these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , which lost only one day their father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have placed and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son says Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a power shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is here with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but that does not get it out , because that demand a mort@@ als .
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the conflict , the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reading from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence to be normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come past every day of newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from files .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person that once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when going through the streets .
for me that is , as if they de@@ ca@@ vern those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories are being exposed in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to talk of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of &quot; four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family had been lo@@ oted by threats in the main city : how armed criminals launched a month for month money from their business , until they end up not only the business , but also had ri@@ pped their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the ache about it decl@@ ines never , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
it included their report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will run or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dis@@ solve my deep feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence signed . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions of how : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like any other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells he himself had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day where his childhood ended .
his childhood has already been over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor has counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of hundreds of thousands , that leaves organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live further in view of the new headlines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , who has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages to which he linked , include images on which violence is represented .
the point check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or to expose a for@@ gery .
but how is the years after something has sur@@ faced the first time ? content in social media , whether true or in@@ true , tends to continue .
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology by Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is abundant reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions to our desire for news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ car crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with bar@@ ns , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically there fell victim to the pit truck .
administration representatives described a fire@@ ball , the w@@ ret@@ ched houses including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people who vi@@ vi@@ ed the football stadium .
houses si@@ zzle and res@@ oh@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the awk@@ ward .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the incident constitute the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of that .
it shows rows shor@@ tw@@ ined bodies that are irrit@@ ated on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo was recorded several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but cannot be attributed to any real trage@@ dies in the context of the trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote @-@ Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses greatly reported of atrocities , before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only based on satellite images could be illustrated the follow @-@ up time .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the Armen@@ ians in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo emerged as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further brings personal comments , such as this example mis@@ nis@@ hed the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to arguments to arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who could escape , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported of the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a su@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to see this information .
the original fee , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that ex@@ iled the AF@@ P as their source , had also noted Th@@ ein Sein und this statement , but had not related the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling dates back to the year 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed @-@ mask private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have attempted to expose the counter@@ fe@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have linked examples of the failed use and linked them to the respective countries on which side they have been published . therefore , we want to be more visible than through the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked in some cases ) several examples of mis@@ br@@ äu@@ y use can come .
here are some cases that can now be recovered wholly ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point out pages or server , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ cons .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ der , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the mass@@ acres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atrocities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that ref@@ utes this .

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abuse of the image from the DR Congo , along with a twe@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to del@@ ve timi@@ dity , as yet the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar Government published a ri@@ oting for what it regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly dark news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understandings regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ri@@ tification , which is published exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ feit images of sc@@ aff@@ ections that run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to announce that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and the other direction ( which is often shared by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this news page affir@@ med that the President of Myanmar is taking part in 2012 , that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story to the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the image remains in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students , who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from now deleted , the Catholic near An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ der@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;

they wanted to achieve that their communities took on these events , rather , in the name of Islam , to pay greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as proof of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were adopted in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre , put in circulation , translated discussions as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ si@@ diary .
of the Embassy in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clark &apos;s missionaries were missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , ink also points out , but are no longer fully re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data contracts with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps / date stamp exist on the web @-@ board and interfere with cap@@ tions in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ stable of 2010 , the image finally carries a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that this Po@@ sts pass through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the bl@@ ends of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the crimes of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated as a comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give the images no longer believe .
with social media there are tens of people who are un@@ inten@@ tional to exercise the water around a tragedy .
induced this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atrocities were un@@ true and tasted it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that rejection of images of a ref@@ usal is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images reader and viewers dis@@ sensi@@ ti@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , investig@@ ating how violent media are working to help others ) .
while there is quite a lot to discuss elo@@ qu@@ ent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for the present news reporting .
techni@@ cian experiments experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where an image might suggest something sug@@ gesting what actually can be used from the context or on completely wrong way .
however , any examination of false grants should also be taken into consideration as internationally as it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) makes an effort to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ eable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese su@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist@@ ently stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
one word or phrase is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite some time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages .
the blog is used for example words from the VAT of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :

how Sri Lanka is byp@@ assing with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high water and lands@@ catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses the end of May , are crossed by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ enz@@ i centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and sl@@ amm@@ ers .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people have been transported to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water gaps in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene in the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the disaster disaster :
floods in Tan@@ wal@@ ama city with water states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et supply regular updates to the flood of water .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly escape wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday overweight water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for b@@ ail@@ outs and another five are made to transport not@@ ches for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
also various organizations and Star@@ tu@@ ps have been prepared to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and life@@ guard d@@ ron@@ es require for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate the dry foods and life @-@ needed goods for floods -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location information with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ ph@@ sturb@@ ate Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed the users allowed a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then passed free to the s@@ lan@@ ed R@@ ote cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat arrangements for floo@@ ding water and lands@@ li@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and do aid .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; use permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and love girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ ung .
in one minute we call for par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next year , we are subject to rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head , tied from an American flag , other batt@@ ling slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
it ent@@ ra@@ ze me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different species but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim Dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims know how I do not fit there .
dec@@ e@@ ased will be disp@@ ens@@ ed
I am not alone with it alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is already sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day where he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western performance the religion was removed Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , the Western books have been coloni@@ ze for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark ones that you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid zer@@ dis@@ ed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to pursue them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked in the news industry for three years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty narr@@ atives are dominant in our news .
this fo@@ b o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that has conducted nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential elections .
this scar@@ f fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to wear their head of head in public buildings and acid su@@ di Arab , Muslim women , by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ ca@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were taken along with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this scar@@ f has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ less occupied that often Si@@ kh men and children are aimed at the aim of anti @-@ terrorist attacks and ra@@ ges .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the fo@@ ols of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed to account here where 7 million Muslims account for the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the Auth@@ ors in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewellery design at 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan thought out of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ f@@ aded Muslim and Americans .
but am I now unavoidable Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ anism ?
sometimes , when I ask people why I don &apos;t tell a por@@ k , I say - instead of getting rid of my Muslim recipes , or to carry my hand@@ craft to all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze , we do not carry all the pocket Cor@@ ps with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who are striving to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ established Islam@@ ism machine with back@@ ers , Thin@@ k @-@ tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility exists in more than a stranger , who under@@ lining the head of a woman .
or as the scary card of attacks on mos@@ ques all over the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms is att@@ acking our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a mus@@ lim@@ a was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social historians describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbor in the br@@ ung see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the sound@@ ing ritual with my daughter , when I see her in my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of fle@@ eing the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and from evil that one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly with her sisters ; as she has been winning a contest for the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it &apos;s the picture of it that I close at this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi Hei@@ liger ; and a cor@@ k with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can virtually mem@@ ori@@ ze .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a thing to be what she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that was founded through centuries - by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
bel@@ ong@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my cro@@ oked grandfather cri@@ es .
in the middle of it , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan in order to ruled his family in India , Kash@@ mir , family that he could not join in his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists that have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans are all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , Kash@@ mir@@ an sub@@ ordinate of the British Empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , we go back deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ planned history .
it means to remind that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , divided into Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the suicide would have risen among veter@@ ans since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means to know that when a tragedy is hi@@ ked off the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history has reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim b@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , means the in@@ dur@@ ess inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identities with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ ca@@ v of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ici@@ ans , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble bolt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons can build on this doubt structural Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ hos@@ tility is to be found in the Muslim registr@@ ships who began with President Bush and expanded with President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely affects Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and bombs which we reject Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University attended a scientific in@@ accurate picture and should judge them , groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply advised to dis@@ locate the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expres@@ sive prints that we have in our news transactions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to grasp our frequently bearing identities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See something , S@@ ay something of Bu@@ zz@@ ar ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ o Muslim ; the viral Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret lives of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslim ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ licity of Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , mus@@ li@@ ally , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am worried because of this difficult global time , in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for the conspir@@ atorial the@@ or@@ ists that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier she had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old as it was my daughter , but who today made me a unavoidable Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ ble track in my speech .
things that might wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , likes a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations are held in the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why don &apos;t I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and destroyed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago was Scientific Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and unaware of the &quot; different &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I was able to introduce a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake spe@@ ople , while he has already broken up countries and &quot; among others , &quot; goes far beyond the invisible and invisible 1.@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect to someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ en@@ force@@ able blog .
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written floor but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate language variety of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not forwar@@ ded to the children born there .
for the creators of the project are :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities who must accept diversity - safe spaces where citizens do not have to forget who they are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whereas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are often linked to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format story t@@ eller tells their story first in their own language and then translate them into English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they perform their devotion and representation that the audience reflects upon it .
they call forth laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ves also takes an opportunity to explain the typical customs of narr@@ atives of narr@@ atives .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ ble of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having said the importance of its Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara was asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organise their own story t@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico demand from the United States New res@@ ett@@ lement of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ viewing of public debt from Puerto Rico , who took to 72 million US dollars , the last 3 April 2017 several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march began with the pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ onic Capit@@ ol , the Government Building of the capital , and ran through to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was declared by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ons of debts ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Lutheran Church in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advocates for ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation of debts have also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts are held responsible for their corrupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a Committee committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and sup@@ pressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be derived with declining retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the country &apos;s largest territory in the United States - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party membership based on the socio @-@ economic development , a law of public responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , actions will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night@@ fall for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian we@@ develop@@ ler Bas@@ le K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ le Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is organised in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , manager at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wishes to discuss how movements for free @-@ level knowledge are structured , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look over the fog that surrounds our news and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ le K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on 3rd of October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective Mem@@ ories gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary convic@@ tions ?
the web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ le reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented herself as in@@ sider of the Assad administration and taking note of a alleged death sentence against her husband .

a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ ket played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le cultural prototype was pres@@ ci@@ ent than the work that he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civilizations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , that architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this strip @-@ shift into digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not complete this project as yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with it , of dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English at , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he taught other prisoners , to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually held a one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ it ) , a pro@@ verb that wrote her husband in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a year .
they squee@@ zed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .

&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is happening on every visit ,
that I sink in the world of thy enchanting eyes ,
that I left the mind at the moment in which we embrace .
that any of the dangers no matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , bonds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I jump in every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with my passion for me ,
if your eyes will tell you well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness ,
to get all the moments back ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself , that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ tion &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or enforced by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in custody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : because of corruption Ver@@ ur@@ pers Director after release from release again on previous post
Mozambique reacted by anger to a corruption , in which a government member returned after half his sentence to the workplace of the state apparatus in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants who were sentenced to 22 years in prison .
the money came from public funds from Mos@@ ambique airports , whose Council was in Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re @-@ attitude to the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with an opinion of the general rule of the Republic , whom the application exp@@ ires , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ b@@ aza , once again to hold its old post as the firm had no lack of discipline after his detention .
however , a lot of inhabitants don &apos;t want the action to be good .
the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , brief C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to make the decision of the company :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that even the company should have a lack of discipl@@ ining proceedings against the res@@ ellers .
however , the Company apparently p@@ onder@@ ed no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type he would have advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and gave them half to eat .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and to pin his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has granted to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is happy to pay for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of no morality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state rewarded because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him offen@@ ded I cannot believe that someone has been rewarded in such a way that the state already massi@@ vely offen@@ ded .
Cam@@ pe@@ aza lacks morality and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead serves only by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ ele it &apos;s about an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is tired of man who is charged and finally condemned to a long sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te fav@@ ored it , the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines will not only be remembered as the first independent President , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and secondary .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when it was energetic that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for its ambitions , their own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said also : &quot; I do not know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not turn away from its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also declined :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat at 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; lime PA@@ E &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or age @-@ alter@@ nating .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people from East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely inter@@ mitt@@ ance con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which is commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with racism usually but the word itself not automatically deri@@ ve from hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as to their use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with two different meanings , which have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair will also be written on Bur@@ m@@ ese , also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , just like other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( camel ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ uses A@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the questionnaire ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it is going to reduce hate speech for more radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be analytical must be before it &apos;s all po@@ sts that were in suspicion , racism .
Facebook destro@@ ys the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automatic , does not understand what you write on fac@@ et @-@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the above words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( age group ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to avoid its nationalism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship is often a cat@@ tery and mouse game , whereby the users are to start social networks , use a new word or an alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and me , the Li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours is prohibited , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not fail . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or the simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism are in the country badly .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ or@@ ship these words only will bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ al@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fake Po@@ sts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship have taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users make themselves more funny and write about the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook Po@@ sts that contained no hate speech , but nevertheless they were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch inheritance curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to check if Facebook removes the mail which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have increased their social networks to increase their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks aims to heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed for his failure to speak out of their bur@@ ial @-@ hate speech on his bur@@ ial sides under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better to look at the context rather than code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end with the marriage
an wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the marriage is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously by the country to ban this practice , so that the re@@ tar@@ ding age is now at 18 .
before this amendment of the adul@@ thood , some members hold Hindu and muscular religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interfere with , since that , at the age of not the maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ Kinder@@ Convention Center , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago , was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
2011 confirmed the official statistics office of the country that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were endeav@@ ouring to prevent laws of marriage , followed on the foot and enjoyed themselves much support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leader , Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was argu@@ ing for tension in this really complicated matter and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but in the beginning of 2017 the bill of law against the child &apos;s marriage was decided , despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained themselves , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree with the law and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle issued on Inst@@ agram once again :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill bill against children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for and no one against it was decided .
once he has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of child@@ h@@ ehe had finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who dressed a minister in education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the heart of the thing , but know what ? the marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal , and that is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to lay the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was at last :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , present@@ able news !
the adul@@ tery has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who listened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was noted , noted :
the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ sive age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious community of 18 years .
the draft amendment to the amendment of the adul@@ tery was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all the members who were against them have voted for the law .
the marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ par@@ rot .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to accept his promises now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the prosec@@ utor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a prop@@ on@@ ent of the law , argued , it is definitely lawful that Mahar@@ aj would proceed against the law , wished for most social media users , one would address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that we would like to invite the state into our bedroom , &quot; simply specifically talking about that the state , our daughters , protects them towards the advantage , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it is coming to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where the inf@@ ancy in various gra@@ dations are legal or the norm continues , although there are laws they say .

by the mirror of web sites , Turkish users can view back to Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ Seite was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally ev@@ apor@@ ated .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since over a month Turkey has now been the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle , en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day after day will become more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information , as well as reliable information .
both students and journalists and fans of TV series are fighting against blocking .
although many techn@@ ologically shared Internet users are used to use byp@@ assing tools for block websites ( an actual article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been posted by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ ate sites ( sites that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so machine computer connections ) that is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available despite legal prohibition however .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything to cover sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also involved that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ ze@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ sten similar mir@@ ror@@ ate if in the respective country in Wikipedia .

there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mir@@ rors .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which one can then see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .
a ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ischer Wildlife Photo@@ grapher uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around for himself , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors .
this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera in itself and try to grasp the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar endeav@@ ored to bring Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ali wildlife to the international stage .
and his hometown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which draw attention to Nep@@ ali wildlife .
he described Facebook how he helps him this first @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate Wildlife Photo@@ grapher ! !
I felt straight at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to achieve global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
and he should know it , for he was tiger already standing from face to face toward :
a tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping @-@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness at home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately works , we see ourselves and it turns me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding the utmost care to address the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use an o@@ ron@@ ome or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband due to social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm in order to get this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a shame and rejected by her family and the village community , after they had approached an un@@ married relatives .
the tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf of names , is also common among men . however , they have far less chance to fear , if any , they should not return to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health subjects , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main focus of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of its video camera , an un@@ covering of practices such as children &apos;s married to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ fied , and manages these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in its discussion took place , were women who did not call their hus@@ bands out by name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
according to the names of their hus@@ bands , not to speak out loud , a bread , which they are all du@@ ple@@ dged and never asked in question .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered to be left behind as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted her husband to never be named in the name of his husband , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the panel discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh for a long time after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him by now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini began its first issue lu@@ sion@@ ate .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some felt it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women were tempted to bring the discussion with a practice .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ aks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married female never to speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she kis@@ sed during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole an@@ gered frustration against him and his family by curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in ad@@ renalin rush about it , having an ancient fires having broken , the women actually try to actually try their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into his head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she tac@@ kled her , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ised in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the cast@@ or red point , if he also acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laughs only and I listened to carrying it on him .
the other women have not completely ceased with it but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each Dis@@ cussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack up lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things about whom they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , for example like our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have supported only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ um @-@ Kur@@ ta , wearing a wide shirt over a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion on the merits of their own clothes @-@ election , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , flo@@ ored Roh@@ ini to their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of the year , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly entering the roles :
we have taken only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to tell the name of their hus@@ bands .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry on their forehead too at any time .
the women in the disc@@ sion@@ ate lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the eil@@ lan@@ ging for more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a hard @-@ navig@@ ating river .
by giving themselves self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes back home and told other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was interviewed exclusively in London in 1964 , noted 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beatles were in the country , but this has been enough to shoot the Japanese .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to welcome the Beatles to open arms .
many well known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles also came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the Online Magazine Nik@@ ola Asian Review .

the kit@@ sch of the Beatles also survived everything .
today is the Beatles &apos; commem@@ oration .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should represent John Lenn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are related to the band .
when you love the Beatles , those are your 5 places you must necessarily visit .

the Beatles also came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! took a pilgrimage to London and walked on Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base , such as this R@@ ame @-@ Shop ( R@@ ames are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ ames ! today , the Beatles ist memorial .

at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a single man could bring gold or wealth , the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ acher of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group , which is objective for ob@@ scure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN introduced a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New n reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
this story was originally released on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published in a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community since his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; sub@@ version , &quot; after joining the Charter of 08 , a manifes@@ to that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China described Li@@ us case as an &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told he did not need to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely cured of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man however refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government decided that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed at the end of December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon to China because the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
since the message had spread that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel @-@ Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
owing to his imprisonment , he was not able to take his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for release Li@@ us , as in a statement on June 30 , 2014 :
at the same time , we expect that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits you wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it may help him in his recovery . &quot;
an spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary of Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 , announced that the message will release the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u , but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the invitation of the U.S. Embassy was a fur@@ ious response from China after itself , with the exterior of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with an un@@ responsive and un@@ responsive remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple of follow@@ ings :
protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of its choice , which they will be entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to insist on Li@@ u and its wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally allowing him to go into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ person Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution to Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 , in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concern , whether the vor@@ tices around Li@@ u could see his visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um China called on to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , him could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that there is Li@@ u not allowed to speak with someone outside , including its lawyers , to speak and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um tells further :
Canada demands China to protect its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to protect the freedom and exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry for China called on China in a statement on 29 June to release le@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments that he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news transm@@ itter France Info has already reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome back to the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was known that there is no further information whether France will ultimately absorb it .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of foreign affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liv@@ u and call for a greater tolerance on those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party ( EPP ) called on China to allow ill to treat the sick intellectual li@@ u in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable , prosperous and prosperous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very moving and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
licence : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mug@@ am should Singapore be considered as a city .
this observation triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the law of the law of the law of New York , the Ministers noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because Singapore is compared with other countries .
he ass@@ ures Singapore that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , one he@@ ars that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons led by Shan@@ singers were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , it appeared un@@ inevitably un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the central point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re of the authorit@@ arian rulers appear to be , leaving democrats , leave the tw@@ isted logic since it fits better to their power .
in the end @-@ effect , the answers to his American guests in the last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ths , our political system really non @-@ answers .
appropriate questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers rational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ Ob@@ jects , to clarify his mind , since this conclusion did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our BE@@ K Shan@@ ets would take the effort to clear up this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city Singapore .
by announ@@ cing his comment on the blog , he points out about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire trans@@ cript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ ione , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the ins@@ cription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; why the elections in Singapore were so in@@ consistent even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he for@@ ged Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mug@@ am , who as leaders of a growing generation , which makes such a polem@@ ical statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said , very embarrassed ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old brig@@ ade , what I expect - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mug@@ am , Member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes , is correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review depic@@ ts the weaknesses of Shan@@ ok@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Shan@@ ok@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as it plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gens are of serious significance .
why do the workers defend their military service , defend them only their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in addition , the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have been anno@@ yed by many Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors lately : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your hometown or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices in Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I am sorry , &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I am living there and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions .
on my clear position then the standard answer usually follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly in rage , if they are held for Americans but me don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag visible well on their back@@ pack when travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , a march in Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always supported small map@@ le leaves at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be considered the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
I wouldn &apos;t account for me if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be reflection - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically insignificant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada would really be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can come across .
be harmless means to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , take away from the things around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders &apos; label &apos; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with neighbours .
we lack the warm welcome , open kindness , which I now with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that took the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite their pledge to restore the civil government , the country continues to be governed .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them what rules he makes his friend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
only within the first three days the video was divided up to Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists urged the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at the videos of the video that ins@@ ists on some of the political issues that Thailand has pers@@ isted in recent three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the preliminary condition , which makes the commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ aler absolute decision @-@ making , about important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , its v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was also established in the army , the online content monitors and individuals who were accused , the monarchy will have sl@@ ander@@ ed to prosec@@ uted .
Thailand set a stri@@ ction against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty offen@@ ding ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was launched in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their choice to buy expensive sub@@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds .
in the video , even shown , how people will be thrown into a black van , one more problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because it is supposed to have caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and is threatened by Internet users , they should ins@@ ul@@ ting the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band em@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em &quot; which was already being used by Putin opponents during the protests of 2014 .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war Society takes only very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ off war was officially finished , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the hydro@@ car@@ ess of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , de@@ mining Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to so@@ jour@@ ned in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ h@@ oses are living in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this gh@@ ost villages .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had risen almost over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story stor@@ ehouses of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , which are called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to finish this end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I talk ?
it is still very clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , one sees in the balconies , where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something of her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ quoise company called T@@ ku@@ s@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence economy ( cultivation of scenic products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the District administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build a zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older wife moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is named in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jed@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave front of ab@@ dic@@ s to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will always remain in Asia Minor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial support from her daughter and insisted that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly instal@@ ments are just 9 dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; is there to be .
aun@@ t G@@ alya says that she and other villagers attempt to meet regularly and celebrate holidays throughout .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls her aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build a zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ part@@ um Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remind themselves of the cre@@ eks before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ov@@ asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ lim@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ al@@ ous city in Ab@@ ov@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 child for each child .
your husband is working in the coal .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she told that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it is actually something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone was living like it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day the city and war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation turned to the end , a little boy returned to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball , who rolls up the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
while running , some of them throw stones at the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Wall@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Br@@ aking .
this article of Amy Br@@ aking was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is available here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of those places in the Mex@@ ica City Tap@@ ach@@ ula , which is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old Mexic@@ ans , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ e@@ el and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in te@@ ddy bear .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , she knows many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) became a destination for Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with cold , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and local immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people coming to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on a box .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can not pay , they get rid of them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yod@@ ur@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ aking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , as African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he relates that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the track together and that Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on builders of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest in M@@ om Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that their guests will often send text messages when they go , to greet them or to report about the course of their trip .
she declares that her Christian faith was the power@@ train of her work .
you don &apos;t know much about Africa but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants to travel through wallpaper .
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s .
we took this winter in Valen@@ ça and its family migrants in their little house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are being sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar spent the night .
currently , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border to the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
having lived for three years , he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through wallpaper , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from the people who wanted to make money by him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he was in demand for an accommodation and a non @-@ known , an isolated house , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she is trying to decide where the next step is going to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travelers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ g@@ ically because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , they feed in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair @-@ fle@@ ets which made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ kids and lots of travelers more , young and old .
she laughs griev@@ ed , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users of the de@@ aler@@ ship .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile user in the Tian@@ shan District of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message that the app is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app after they exchanged the app .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police state that the app would identify and monitor the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age of porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sites to make users pointed out how much time they spend online and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can naturally be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; government actors or even h@@ ackers could manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announcements about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , sup@@ pressing ethnic minorities , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit unrest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange an extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ ters .
that on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( dates back to the board ) , the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a Check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ate when they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are compelled to use devices that are intended for elderly people to use .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the wax .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( dates back to the directory , and also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the passwords requirement for a Windows operating system and allow full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s party to minimize the proliferation of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government agencies , public authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , mentioned also these new monitoring methods :
X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all the residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st August their &quot; personal ID card , mobile phones , external drives , portable drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality right of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole host of other possible missions , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane illustrates his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you looked at and find that you are completely alone in a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has been dissolved and reveals a truth that is clearly identifiable , both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one who has crus@@ hed themselves in a list of feelings and expressions , who do not allow a metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality comes back and you sit behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and performers - the characters into beings are transformed from flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth turns on the axis of disaster . you will realize that you are caught up here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grandparents , stone built around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson learned &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service he formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he found his power over us as he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were swe@@ pt up during a peaceful protests such as wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it turned out to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; E@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the districts was cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is p@@ opped up into the arteries with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night the things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighbourhood stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the still@@ ness by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we were united to a glorious picture , filled with my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you are liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t care in the t@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you get ready to meet us at the Military Security Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then , I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have sent it all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; Omni@@ ahu , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not close by . &quot;
his h@@ light @-@ filled eyes lined up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps by revolution .
I was so sure of my cause as I said , &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never ceased to look you into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I will not regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in sol@@ itary and his father the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fr@@ ank of this curse set me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psych@@ ic torture that I was abandoned for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cry the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I take full details exactly before I cleared the space .
different from the other time it probably shared a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and must immediately sit down without having to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ made communication method : to beat the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ ics was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first aid to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he rep@@ lied to me .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells lay a respected man middle aged which looks similar to me and called the &quot; doctor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the perfect darkness there are no distinctive face lifts to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are of their existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be free to leave him when I stay .
liar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always to k@@ ills this time the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; drawing on the 13th s@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to be heard . &quot;
thus the secret was established : to protect the citizens from ourselves , and prevent that we are free the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ board and prov@@ oked the narrow eye @-@ field of their world view .
this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a curse to call co@@ existence to transform the criminals to a hero .
I get to the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ach on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , which ent@@ ail him . &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up an end . &quot;
I answered not .
I used to answer it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become an ordinary communication instrument after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said I had to get used to it , punished me , although I had nothing to do to make this punishment .
a sentence in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he is called the affection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ acks .
your hen is beating on your letter .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold your scre@@ ams .
my cry did not waste him enough , so that they ex@@ chan@@ ts the tube through a cable .
during my first time I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a trash collectors , or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us from their point of view , great invention of a giant Kab@@ els .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost all my feelings in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ am scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and did not find a favor , which is why he was next to an electri@@ fied St@@ ab .
electricity f@@ lowed my entire body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ neck body , who lay out on the floor was the perfect black@@ board .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning opens the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my master , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Norwegian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the majority of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he sticks to his canvas , time to his computer , and also back to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its nicotine to discover lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and asks their Ancient opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls on the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find relative to his hometown Am@@ man relative , but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to the very far after San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries , and he may feel according to his own statement by man who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign imperialist intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not exist , he viol@@ ates a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination to American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian v@@ ault of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he is poured into the water of Nes@@ w@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in that time it is planned for Muslims , to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the judicial law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ nat@@ ors speak flu@@ ent coffee and the s@@ wa@@ iter of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one thro@@ ws a view into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is difficult to avoid basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramad@@ an water - to not land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan had canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ al branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ än@@ ger Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , to resist the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press review in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was said &quot; straight &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer .
many also affir@@ m the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the established legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la expressed the j@@ ord@@ an people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; which continue to pursue &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply disgu@@ ised rhet@@ oric , but in fact a more clearly visible cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality reflected in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional Gender Standards to Lei@@ be , who formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently crus@@ hed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &apos; has been increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ orary members reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it still impe@@ ded that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to have victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law enforcement battle of victims from 1954 , women are exposed to risk @-@ related violence , &quot; at un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman is nothing to happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to return to subjects that are long as tab@@ oo in his country for a long time .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , is that he is his music that is full of explicit approaches to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but politics was inv@@ aded me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are in the core politically , can continue .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , He@@ ter@@ o or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that hardly anyone is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality by LG@@ BT@@ Q + -@@ individuals are still heavily cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ an Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were swe@@ pt out of the context and were cens@@ ored according to his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only a processed version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b buys open for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homo@@ sexu@@ als don &apos;t speak to Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which is still alive today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ es in the eighth century , could openly write homo@@ sexuality in the eighth century , why are Jord@@ an@@ rier not that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ial kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government is sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association , with the grounds that they could have expressed critically on the problems expressed in social media , which coinci@@ des with the deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River .
for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has taken an appearance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made of slow , depres@@ sive and internal changes . he is sure that these changes occur from day to day in the heart of the Cuban Society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b had dreamed as millions of other Arabs also , from a Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not only dreams of bringing his work by Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region helps with music , art and literature a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , exten@@ tions and artificial kind , guided democracies . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to resist and consequently also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the largest 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one thought it &apos;s a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the forts , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were handed over and from a time date , in the armies from west Japan in the northeast mar@@ ched to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it can be hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking for a long time the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en on : two forts are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and still a breath @-@ taking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high tower was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body @-@ care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime TV and promote a legitimate job like the hair@@ pin .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where there are road rau@@ b and illegal drug trafficking every day .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not sure .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can produce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers , &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts engage with each other in order to show who of them can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school of August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people , exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training instead of poor advice in the hair@@ style of art which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and their bi@@ ds opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in the school preceding March , and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because of the love of the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love @-@ Let@@ ter to guer@@ rilla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the working version of the contribution &quot; love message to guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel free to accommodate affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young Youth Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) that young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla warfare .
only recently , their country was show@@ cas@@ ing of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Forces colum@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace treaty than so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
but before the colum@@ bi@@ ans a long way up until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla warfare , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to military rhet@@ oric and carried around their arms around the clock , they must now re@@ integrate into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company , in turn , had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , it has to resume their ranks and support it when building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to close together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did , until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love @-@ ups to former guer@@ rilla fighters in order to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla fighters that should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bogotá in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi in 2014 , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those who forget them need much more necessary .
he plan , he told him to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent need .
thus the plan of writing letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the discourse of a war story for a common history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major towns in Colom@@ bian like Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa , and Bogotá .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ota Art traveled in the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC showed themselves how they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of submission of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything that is in between , &quot; the politicians told Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a collabor@@ ator of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ants led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa @-@ fighter .
when I saw in one of the &apos; Cam@@ bu@@ ds &apos; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ rilla warfare , I saw a guer@@ rilla fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ er , a deadly weapon in the thorn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless I spoke to him and asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I am answering it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ches .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC led to a discussion round together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leaders of F@@ ARC re@@ perc@@ ussions the history of organization , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State of the Colom@@ bian people are experienced . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help build society in this country .
for a purpose of this scale , it is worthwhile to overcome all the obstacles &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard heard and had no choice , and realizing that the people I often seen as monsters , and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings , who were transformed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful to me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have been killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ ans was prophes@@ y that after dis@@ armament , peace would prevail .
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to stand up arms , to stand up and prot@@ esting for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , we call on all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - about all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

after a group of Che@@ chens to experience from the gender equality of their country@@ men , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
because of fear for her life they moved to the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
then the photos made by my documents made by the very W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to use the family , you sh@@ ab@@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke the last day in the hospital again .
apparently some women had everything to get started and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I f@@ aded two keywords in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been placed - in those of the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , yet my male name still stands , but the doctor understood and laid me among the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful to me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got a threat .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they created absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by passing up without going through the streets ; others wanted I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny in the official TV , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people even spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire Republic has damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can not stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a kn@@ her around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark window plate and a Num@@ ber@@ n@@ plate with a 95 dr@@ one .
having happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights @-@ friends audi@@ ted the Num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I do not want to disclose their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the land , but then something seemed unbelievable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it , without record me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
came up and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my cell .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about you , you are in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you drop . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality but this is a tab@@ oo topic .
I am still wearing some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements in my mind .
so much I wish , this emotional barrier I can not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best in order to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble as to see the person reminded of her past - that is , in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I made a report last week in Washington .
for me I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked with someone the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that in Ramad@@ an , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t shut a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so I mean , she probably invite those relatives before they take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are now even s@@ ule men stuck in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine tells me there wouldn &apos;t be very many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives in order to place Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be recorded there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be changed , you will show their bodies on television and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately pushed to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that now just a pres@@ ump@@ tion or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained in Ar@@ gun for one @-@ half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new about them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was with himself when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise you could not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people heard of a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always wor@@ e my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already in most Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually left us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were tw@@ isted ; I had colored eyelashes , carried out tubes and short t@@ ops .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sh@@ aria never saw me just a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me hit .
it was a small place where several benches were stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an expression : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if they make yourself funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed , they are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never sinned , never hun@@ ted , and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace held up ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the Plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak of morality in television .
he did not talk about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people started in the city starting to change .
who had vi@@ ed and laugh@@ ed earlier , regarded it at once with suspicion .
in the period I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily increases .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise teac@@ up , meetings , I put it to the hospital and help them get Essen@@ es .
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I se@@ wn sugar @-@ variety .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
so nature is that nothing has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who wish to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no sw@@ amps in them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ al , who have the Russians too , but on the entire planet there are they - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear .
I have been here so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that they will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a pleasure .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be here personally but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ mor@@ ants within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate among the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong rise in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and ashamed for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that may arise in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous .
a video held on YouTube was held the moments after he had beha@@ ved himself .
some people managed to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only hom@@ icide that appropri@@ ated itself in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists warn of this that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights mel@@ ts that this month has posted some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable due to the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to become a living .
in a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy the power took over and 1925 , under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most sought @-@ reaching and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets few of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has denied the anc@@ ra@@ azi Arabs and systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishermen and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate for Co @-@ operation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , ended up at 55 % a further school and have 45 % university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian family activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ azi .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become even worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z &apos;s newly @-@ coming ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
since function@@ aries and institutions fav@@ ored not Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will be dra@@ fted access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to conce@@ al their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to become so in@@ stig@@ ated , since the Arabic name in the workplace cannot be tolerated , otherwise the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi needs to endure , suggests human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who refer themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even set out well thought of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money despite equal education than men .
that women are still under stric@@ ter observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women face an smoo@@ ther blan@@ ket sooner or later in various areas of life and that discrimination based on sex are still drawing across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I lei@@ gh twice and thre@@ e@@ fold underneath .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LG@@ BT@@ IQ community or black women from the Diaspora , when I mention , on which way we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to stand up &quot; their voices and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &quot; my master &quot; to sing , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two @-@ fold manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin cities deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from a higher risk domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men , who have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuse to take into account the gender as well as the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere , which has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so@@ jour@@ ner , 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is an ent@@ humane and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb through cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to lie white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded in order to place women of different incomes and narrow down by the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to get rid of myself full of femin@@ ism and re@@ join me of the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which for my dark skin and my status as a woman was called into life rather than eag@@ er@@ ly known for a white feminist paradigm that is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres of being created by us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the Book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ gement : as we can conquer ourselves , we can define ourselves by changing our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alisation after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of feminist movement , which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected .

in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Paraguay ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ ants in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . this article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their Ex@@ allies , who had become violent towards violent .
since the end of her relationship had passed some time and the police said , their statement would be placed to the ones , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena demonstrated because of failure , the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
some days later the second woman moved back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever have an ad , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to be part of the law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ ation 1 beats and Statisti@@ c 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which does not obey un@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 of Paraguay : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation beats and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really abuse - says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a socialist research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various fields and reports , which , however , do not even want to indicate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the district of State Pro@@ sec@@ utor , 9@@ 600 indicators went for domestic violence . at 70 % of it it was violence against women .
86 % of the ads with the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace courts . even here , 86 % of the adver@@ ts come from .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically eff@@ lu@@ ded , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics are not showing the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister@@ ing in Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes will actually appear . &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated they end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since women &apos;s suicide is not an own criminal offen@@ se , the prosec@@ utor authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from August 2016 alone to August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men .

invisible offen@@ ding and a judicial system , which is not doing nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name to him all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then went to . this should not regret it forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ de with Carlos . but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women who happened to be underestimated , because they are decei@@ ving themselves by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the mission of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had them isolated .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against it and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook user asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for the so long of Carlos and left him not before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had a certain inno@@ c@@ ence for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner lives them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can speak to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays ads with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
it carried out a process against its former partner who developed into an unmistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees also great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ sie ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ y@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ not@@ ch ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees to explain fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal offen@@ se and pun@@ ish tougher as it is already in neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was altered in some points to also win the MPs for the law , the fears that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation may be b@@ illed in Paraguay that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original draft law fores@@ een to bear the majority of ( bureaucratic and economic ) costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just have to look for an ad and want a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lature is not providing sufficient funds for this purpose :
in Paraguay this abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
here , a change must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
whoever swe@@ eps on the face of this facts and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders will run away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as possible , until Mis@@ k@@ ation does not apply more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Sen@@ at . however , some parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage has been cancelled , which the partners called for domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to once again attack his victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the filing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law applies however as a great backing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . this article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to be exposed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by a description of the information minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is locked on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Venezu@@ elan authorities have concluded the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the sult@@ ans .
You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he had a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed on trial , but later returned .
Oman is governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , which came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a State coup .
since then , he has been clo@@ th@@ ed , in addition to his role as a single sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of Defence , Finance Minister , Secretary of State , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the pers@@ isting efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , the public freedoms , including freedom of press , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and de@@ tained .
the authorities reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists who express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closing and detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which since its foundation in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after published in the newspaper on July 26th , 2016 was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary . in this case , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a ruling in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page of the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bind hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Govern@@ ors , was charged with the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS approved the deputy chief of the You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j which was named after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
the paper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the minister had given the statement , that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on each way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists in prison and orda@@ ined the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by a distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ tr@@ ation of the Pres@@ ence of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) in addition to the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was condemned to a year of prison and a penalty in height of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information network to the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was established in the amount of 5000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the Jud@@ gment .
the Appe@@ als Court spoke to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 by the prison sentence of his six @-@ month sentence from the central @-@ prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was assigned to his sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister sent a statement to which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and , which , the Minister expressed itself another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als , to facilitate the publication of the paper .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman recently violated the press freedom .
further injuries include the closing of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation .
due to the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Peruvian authorities are still not ready to put an end to an extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for an anti @-@ Indian authorities :
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can follow their work ;
how to protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including straigh@@ tening ship conditions .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by encouraging freedom of opinion and associations , as well as the right to meet peaceful and providing protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site . there are two reasons for providing a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have severe consequences in Africa &apos;s poorest countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , when building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ or at the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for academic studies in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself searched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to aid the most effective health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understandings of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the most effective national programme for retro@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
AG@@ A : what do you think is the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only set solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get is often not well applicable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
AG@@ A : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : North America and Europe .
the projects are differently encouraged .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
AG@@ A : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
AG@@ A : how is the opinion of the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
AG@@ A : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is demand for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed things to do and the ag@@ grav@@ ated access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that journals are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has served the USA salad for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant , which has been cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ tons of work has been carried out only by its own resour@@ ce@@ fulness and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ varieties he can get borders .
but in the early 200@@ 0s he re@@ marked that more and more Sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them on so .
the patents tend not only for individual sorts , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the last years , more and more such patents have been submitted to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert food security concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still sal@@ uted , but it doesn &apos;t need any longer , since its work is still further complicated by more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock lying in a river to get hi@@ p@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we need to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think these patents go far to Sal@@ ads .
and if they stop judgment , no one can breed any more a new sal@@ at@@ ery , because all the characteristics have been patented . so he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features which he wants .
however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS and have red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are used for plant breeders .
in the framework of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can commit to us that others may be able to freely use seed from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow merely others who buy their seeds , to breed , and not immediately pronoun@@ ce - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant @-@ patent .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ated professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in larger contexts like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter more or just little by raising seeds with natural resistance to breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer , who want to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , the recent examples of being offered by Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer , should also know that the way for example is bred on farms , should also know that the way the vegetables is cultivated .
nutrition sovereignty without seed @-@ sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit to other their seeds still being free to provide them with their action in contrast to pat@@ enting seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is com@@ promised , as the available genetic pool is due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always more limited , in@@ calcul@@ able shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in their doc@@ torate with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that approximately a third of all cart@@ els is protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either at all or just in@@ value .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat are patented in a bigger scale as salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from those through which their tastes or their colour improves up to those because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ hold threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to ever more patents . genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions through climate change are much worse prior to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto spokes@@ woman in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and the collaboration with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant variables &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is essentially taken up a plan which can follow everyone once the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bits innovations but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other way : 20 years to wait , until a patent , is certainly not innovations .
and if you must wait for a long time to breed with plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , it would have lost the struggle already .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept itself to pat@@ rol the plant characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really themselves .
the plants form it themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of crop breeding : &quot; who sp@@ las@@ hing a variety , breeding also its own values into it .
those who believe in the industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ ok@@ ultur@@ ists , for their cultivation of mass@@ aging her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is precise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents , they create most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant see@@ ker Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders would benefit from the prevention of plant patent , &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company .
I need a constant new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors are selling my sorts for a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent for 20 years before competition , one makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
while the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , is an open @-@ source &quot; seed program . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed any new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works at an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bree@@ der differ from country to country where the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that a non @-@ bred plants should not be patented . in this way , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent ® , which allows patents on conventional cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to make the patent title to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operator of seed banks and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ ent@@ age of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds systems declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the scheduled next year of the official start @-@ starting signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit organization , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid agencies like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , who must have the opportunity to come to seeds , to share and improve seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by from Os@@ si to see that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and a blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government dis@@ continued the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on a long @-@ lasting report .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
to defend the Network for Human Rights Information , despite this attack and the condem@@ ning of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , to pursue these goals further , so it has never been as difficult as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI is confirmed that all the technical possibilities are fully exploited to overcome the blocking and not to comply with it . we insist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities have blocked even more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar ) network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ten and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer any access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used to use his blog for the distribution of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write to any in@@ accessible web pages and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also native to the Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , former photographer , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and took a video like the police took physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the block by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to unlock is very old , however , has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ae al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is however for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in arran@@ ging me the feeling of a sie@@ ge . an arrest warran@@ t , a righ@@ tist murder , demonstration at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ tigen go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ y@@ and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of suppliers , possible by byp@@ assing inter@@ net@@ ting and Private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block of web pages , which began to offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content on the Egyptian user .
the situation is also ag@@ grav@@ ated that the cens@@ ors are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , through which they can proceed from court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers report all over Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ den second day is murdered by a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ z Rob@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all@@ ot@@ ted every day and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; find at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . all , however , what happens from the civil@@ ised standard , and what is happening in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call , this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war @-@ ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial writing the newspaper further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atrocities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then questions arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose purpose is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
is the name of &quot; war &quot; more than it beneficial ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil has argued the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra , on the other hand , to call violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neglect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; The most violent site in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio on No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , emphasises the security policy of the state for years .
among these security policy measures also was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state established in the year 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a fav@@ ela by use of a massive police bo@@ ots and a unity permanently .
initially this led to a decrease of enormous death deaths . however , for a few years , the U@@ PP provided for several reports on rail and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws severe consequences for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to use means and ways which are typical for a war . therefore , the intru@@ sion is in the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape , and for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ aying spheres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war along or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police made the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho ver@@ kl@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
in the midst of all these violence also this incident made headlines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of kis@@ sing that the police had fallen out of a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians , fungi to plant
screen@@ shot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loy@@ alist troops .
according to victory , Worldwatch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of sie@@ ge .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected by the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 challenged the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on the investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetr@@ ated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these controlled areas outside Damascus have been granted under sie@@ ge , which led to the population on the site or to be dependent on tunnels and control points .
by long @-@ standing block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas which can plant its own fungi as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria herbal foods and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , their food intolerance also makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we decided for cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for this project for three years and expressed its relief so much more and more &quot; is gaining promin@@ ence . &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ i@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that maintain temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity in 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , local fuel and plastic uses will be used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are used for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faculty farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after a further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breach of the sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provide a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , giving food @-@ remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new food products .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and sie@@ ge becomes visible .
we want our experiences to be inspired in crises areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that are r@@ amp@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 have been injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the last week had called for solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy took place where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to European fores@@ try system , which supervis@@ es the forest land by satellite photographs , in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the ear@@ nest of the situation : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ough@@ s .

numerous videos spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the event :
the Se@@ di@@ ble tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al from the Bund der farmers of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dirt reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again in June as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits are lag@@ ging in furn@@ aces with a high fire risk .
a wide @-@ sufficient proposal for the whale @-@ form , which the government introduced to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to capital .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity by case permitted , if the applicant had access to self @-@ protection , that was an open back door , so that all could be built , &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , itself , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread out to fires of this species .
to these problems came that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants were looking for information or tried to contact relatives .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : you use the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the local population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in life to simplify the work of fire defense and was thus decisive at this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers continued to the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who were persecuted , did not stand : thereby , the website counted more than half a million list@@ ings .

the way from a refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur

during one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair .
at this time A@@ per@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Asia , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her Son again for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning gray was to break the boy .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g@@ outs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ mail @-@ wa@@ date has just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara were ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal @-@ care . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his minor salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar that were heavier than he himself , to earn their living .
at that time , like today , the life of af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded Ash@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site that we worked also .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we do not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years As@@ shar@@ k allowed his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for travel to Europe .
on the dangerous crossing at the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gle on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , A@@ 0@@ f 2002 came to Italy .
some time there was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church twice a day eating at the most depri@@ ved .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high level quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for deposited asylum seekers . it is also true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are disastrous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Human Rights Organization for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum see@@ ker is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special au@@ ditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impro@@ vis@@ ing facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center , if they have officially asked an application for asylum - which may be preferred for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have any money for accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there is also one sheep .
but his un@@ sett@@ ling lifestyle has helped ape to liber@@ ate itself from these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in the construction industry several years ago , A@@ him@@ af put his total savings into the formation of a hostel in Venice .
this ran out so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a whis@@ ker .
A@@ ael Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director of Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans company emerged , among them cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of the Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and an Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ du@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian food and retail trade and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says ash with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and need to get the same possibilities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harv@@ ests in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity .
A@@ ael has made this journey himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft resolution which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must opt to use social networks within six months after a successful legislative regulation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as by reference number .
those who neglect this step may be sentenced to six months of sentence or of the final payment of a criminal payment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by sixty @-@ party members , is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in May , another deputy appointed a legislative proposal , in which tougher pen@@ alties would be introduced to the president or a high officials .
under Egyptian law the ins@@ cription of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the legislative proposal , such a fact would be punished with pris@@ ons and fin@@ es , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the mat@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrated against the military coup , which led to the bai@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as there were more than 700 people , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in custody on a court appearance .
recently , his trial was postponed on 20 May because the prison line according to human rights groups has failed to bring the accused of jail in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
