<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have danced to American music, American authors have read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound impact on me, that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's letter, which was covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who was the highest federal court with judges, who were inclined to fill his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to method Man, "me it was as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with its narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, African American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number, ever reached by the Party as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not dump Trump and his voters in line with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world takes up a deeply sadder person with whom I was talking about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps's worldview did not agree with the director of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" "" "Phoenix" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Little intolerance also stands also in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr whose life struggles long the environment and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While trump his way to nominees to nominees to nominees, they offered me a stop and the object to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of its contempt towards the non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people have voted for dreump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, I almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To order people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of which are white for dredging because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm. WC.: so much as" "" "clearing the White against all other ethnicities" "" "; word play from white in touch on whites and whiplash what as much means" "" "skiddertrauma)," "" "as it called the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like always, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of an Kenan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas on this promise, saying, The Hell with manifold, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word of speech with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a onomy strong "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" dismissed the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latino a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "I answered them." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a single and onomatingly strong "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La Banda de MÃºsica (Music Association) has now been playing a symphony symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI.</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and play with shiny eye and play in the turbulence you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, pongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with playback instruments made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling es under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have started to turn parts of the apostasy into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitated violins, violas, Celli, bass guitars, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpet, and percussion, all produced out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez is a local ecologist and musician teacher for the children of Cateura, at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio, something which he had never seen before: one from the drain violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra to play on instruments from reprepared material and that called The Count Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance at:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest nations - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens within an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already been operated in liberian waters illegal fishing, before it was raging the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised in this way and less inclined to welcome a lobrecher of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves swiftly against the ship. they eliminated him, one of its harbors and refused to give him a fishing force.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "said Benedict Kiilu, a director of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegale fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who were then driven from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"in doing so, we have eight countries who are inminded and working together. they trade information out and stand on each other when it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition unregulated: what is being captured is hidden, so because it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing for regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the intentional disrespect of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions today occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port infection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite television.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - including such suspicious driving routes, such that indicate that a ship will load his captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a cantivirus, where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a Strafreer.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries who are against illegal fishing can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that their ships cannot sell their cargo. and that even the numbers of penalties can even be forced, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial loss for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is not profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counselling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to withdraw valued 20 million USD to lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing for the region and continues to attract commercial fishing from all over the world. by these well-known illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit Licenspapers, indication of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature reserve.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-fully organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship could be illegally fish and a country could then say" "" "you dared my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations into desdemonic ships since its inception was FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="127">There has been criminal networks uncovered, which had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed whispering ships and found them.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission from FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detach the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishing use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's why we are trying to cross," says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be contracted by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i to help criminally ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana. a platform that offers satellite television and can be displayed around the world by means of the position of each individual traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - this is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permitting the tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but they also scare deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who have formerly unlocked without a license and barely had to reckon with consequences, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have now accounted for a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses ever since.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, had helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board smugglers networks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission from FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries joined together in 2015, so called the West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "With certainty the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures also in other regions" "", "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country had report his first major triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road and towing networks were used, which is now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they continued a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="197">This is an adaptive version of a interview of Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is presented here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Quijano said Quijano in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden, the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years he held the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torture and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriezer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a federal Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">"" "all called him" "" "Kent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him, and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have made you friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only on that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acronym ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionaries's army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers' party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he offered me to go back into the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would become secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had brought me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything from it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket wrapped bag and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen items were placed and taught me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted in an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There, the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spy in and saw a couch that were tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, he came the same smell from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and they were joining.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be displaced.</seg>

<seg id="269">Back then in the age I had no idea what the "war-mare" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was on the military even when I was there - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war clutors are a bayonet or perhaps military watermarks that one takes on an enemy which is fought.</seg>

<seg id="275">I always wondered how my Father, the head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officer in gendarmerie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defense, a co-conspirators had been accused of his crimes. I did not refute, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="299">I asked myself again and again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could just have put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what their corpses leave?</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overtake two important skills: passive voice skills to understand the starting text and an active language skills to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native speaker should translate into French as an example from English into French - not by the French translation into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms do not employ employees with English as a native language, the translations into English. this may be misguided by understanding, cost reasons or relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have a foreign employee, do not release any other company internally. then the Japanese employee, whose translation will be considered the best, for translator - no matter how good or poorly his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and puzzled sentences are created by machine translation, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator. this applies to some languages quite especially.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling drugprints, which often t t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable to a jewelry or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the Internet portal of VPITV and El Capitolio TV will no longer be available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters recorded images of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by oppositional groups who refutes the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court had dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="405">Previous post-research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had yielded that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNA. it is a technique that will respond to the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Fish cows, decaying schools"), which is edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where they did not work together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her degree graduation at the university she returned once again to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "those from which something has become" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one denotes more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money handed over their underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">"" "" "" "however, what is not mentioned here is that the children need to do so many days of housework that will never be paid and being victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract that you cannot raise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="425">This was widely used as a Criadazgo practice in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked a couple of years for an organization which fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls who were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered witnesses, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, because the sense of gratitude which is vaccinated against crib is generally silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and make something out of themselves "for another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that occupies the girl with himself and justifiantly justify its exploitation by faith, that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not be a training, and maybe even starving.</seg>

<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">In late January 2016 Ferreira provided with a stick on MarÃ­n until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cribta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep-rooted practice of criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they recorded the criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest, and demanded that there will be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows than children are registered," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to injure the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married and nearly 60 Civilian organizations called for a high-level examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to judgment, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo will be brought to judgment.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are not only exploited as manpower, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all of them and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for instance cleanse the fridge, plasted the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more spare time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga said she had to never starve, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the goodman as eating out of the refrigerator."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the goodman, a former military and sympathisers of Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He indeed held her for intelligent, but did not talk with her. "the landlord had found someone who heard, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord fears that they were the education they had allowed to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was very clear, however, that for everything she got from them, paid with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school Alvarenga was discriminated. "one thing about which is almost never spoken, are harassment and the rails that are exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't want to invite anyone to my home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still is the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the advances that have been reached in the past six years in order to reconstruct the lives of those who had been affected by the "Trinity catastrophe" from March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture Miyagi Prefecture. Preyagi Prefecture was a real Prefectures in Japan northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring buildings Fukushima and Iwasig were forced, because the tsunami had vanish whole coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already by that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper comprises both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwasig</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (dates back to, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwasig.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures of Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, one still tries to settle for six years after the disaster, evacuated of persistshelters (dates back to, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe nearly 80 thousand people saw themselves forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwates lived in such perseverance.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the world's evacuation from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 percent of the evacuated ones who were shelved following disaster shelters were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected positions.</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could detect, have 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their passions were opened until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefect structures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing volumes in Iwasig and Miyagi have now returned in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing boats have been rerecorded in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have drawn up into compassion.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 percent of farmland in Iwasig, and less than 50 percent of agricultural land in Fukushima could be used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear waste zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered over again, but also here Fukushima still falls far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwasig is back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast-dwellers, it can feel more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to find an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and how her ourage has changed to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that this was still not done enough in catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is for those who have to evacuate those from the Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In her expenditure on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Sunoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that the Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people, returning to Fukushima, in lasting spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the date of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their native prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster area, most of the evacuation tests are most of the evacuation ones who still have to reclaim more than 50 years. they have to compete in correct Behausungen. this is building projects, the part of the Olympic Games are to take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters people from other countries that speak another language, the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, it is often possible that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode from Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar mills in all Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alme, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no doubt that there are no appreciable sugar-harvested on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earth the sugar industry was silent in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its installations, until only the rumst of steel and concrete remains.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some have rarely changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigated and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar industry does not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are factories in the east of the surohrfactories that are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">It was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds himself exactly that in MaÃ±alI would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry has already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar was produced, less than the 1910 produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvest is no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway line of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity: the 155-sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production factor was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound according to the 2016 report, "agricultural perspectives" from the OECD and the FAO, the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tonnes), the crude oil would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day certainly enters into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar factories, more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar door factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alme on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene is known as a soldier, says the closing of the factory, the word he is most repeated," "" "fraud" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion, not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">So that the place will receive, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first lockers, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which would be removed merely concerning the parts being removed, the addressee and the date differed.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could authorise any acceptance.</seg>

<seg id="690">A song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission from N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations Communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, since 2014 the workshop leader mobile Tonstudios run directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio- and video-production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in north-Quebec with ten Cree-Communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars worked together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus rises that the young participants in discussions topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitebox First Nation, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always control the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has been recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group, who gives them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan is available to the Strophe, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in my interest.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day where you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way of life</seg>
<seg id="709">Yet I believe that we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad living</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also advance our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">That is how they can do what it controls the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are near the entrance to the entrance, "Plastische Models of the courts") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes that were documented by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his movie Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic courts are so common that they do not even notice them any more. however, a new trend, however, turns them in showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome released the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic fired phone ligaments, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu's department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitschy, like in this case, frickie magine:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoddles cooler magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essenes is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaans-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile-style.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone rings.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part in Tokyo at the Tokyo train station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that handles your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a candle for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of a growing flight into comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachsestrogen is used, a favourite dish that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say," "" "wow, cool, now I can disguise my cell phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone-hinges has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handbelts made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # in the deputies.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of foreign and foreign media above the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking in Mexico, the suspensaries and gearboxes regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle takes place.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa box, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the hearing or the communities that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">In doing so, behind each bone fund, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories are numerless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico, the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking will learn") to give these victims a voice and telling stories of people who are in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities have to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The anguish of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") relates precisely these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for every weekend of secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, which lost only one day their father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have placed and go to graves, according to the people we loved to seek." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son says Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th, he should be back again but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, which is here with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father's insurance, but that does not get it out, because that demand a mortals.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the conflict, the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence to be normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come past every day of newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from files.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person that once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to be Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that is, as if they decavern those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are being exposed in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were" "" "missibility." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk of such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of "four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family had been looted by threats in the main city: how armed criminals launched a month for month money from their business, until they end up not only the business, but also had ripped their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The ache about it declines never, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will run or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence signed."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions of how: who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like any other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he tells he himself had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the Babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day where his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has already been over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father saw, which was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings for public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor has counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of hundreds of thousands, that leaves organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live further in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, who has tortured the country in the last four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The point check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or to expose a forgery.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has surfaced the first time? content in social media, whether true or intrue, tends to continue.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it was misleading to use tragedies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there is abundant reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions to our desire for news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with barns, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically there fell victim to the pit truck.</seg>
<seg id="828">Administration representatives described a fireball, the wretched houses including a movie theaters in the vicinity, which was full of people who vivied the football stadium.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses sizzle and resohed corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the awkward.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." by Imgur-users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.multiple photos of the incident constitute the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of that.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows shortwined bodies that are irritated on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was recorded several times in social media, blogs and other platforms, but cannot be attributed to any real tragedies in the context of the tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote-Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses greatly reported of atrocities, before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed," "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only based on satellite images could be illustrated the follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the Armenians in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and trying to win the Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo emerged as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments, such as this example misnished the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to arguments to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who could escape, rape and several deaths, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a sudi-Arab news page, which was misdiagnosed in 2012, the President of the mars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to see this information.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that this Posts pass through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the blends of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the crimes of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated as a comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers cannot give the images no longer believe.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who are unintentional to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Induced this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities were untrue and tasted it the real atrocity of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that rejection of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images reader and viewers dissensitize and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, investigating how violent media are working to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is quite a lot to discuss eloquent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for the present news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technician experiments experimented with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where an image might suggest something suggesting what actually can be used from the context or on completely wrong way.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) makes an effort to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsureable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese sudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resistently stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or phrase is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite some time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">The blog is used for example words from the VAT of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - pampering you around your parents in recognition of how to try yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunscreen language spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The convenience or sloth that you feel after watching on cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They compensates other cultures, revealing other thought-engÃ¤nge and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "unobjectionable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytellers, from Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect to someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Unenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written floor but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not forwarded to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities who must accept diversity - safe spaces where citizens do not have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "whereas" "" "while" "" "they are often linked to understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to" "" "to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format story teller tells their story first in their own language and then translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, they perform their devotion and representation that the audience reflects upon it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou Konves also takes an opportunity to explain the typical customs of narratives of narratives.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fble of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having said the importance of its Fabel, John Nyamusara was asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very happy with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organise their own story tellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reviewing of public debt from Puerto Rico, who took to 72 million US dollars, the last 3 April 2017 several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march began with the puertorionic Capitol, the Government Building of the capital, and ran through to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, manager at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here, contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wishes to discuss how movements for free-level knowledge are structured, and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look over the fog that surrounds our news and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Basle Khartoum, the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he sat on 3rd of October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective Memories gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer of Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police Basle reported on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented herself as insider of the Assad administration and taking note of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basket played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle cultural prototype was prescient than the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in it, that architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip-shift into digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"" "" "" "tragically, Bassel could not complete this project as yet." ""</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, of dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English at, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he taught other prisoners, to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held a one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Wait), a proverb that wrote her husband in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted by anger to a corruption, in which a government member returned after half his sentence to the workplace of the state apparatus in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in 2010 along with four other defendants who were sentenced to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mosambique airports, whose Council was in Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re-attitude to the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the general rule of the Republic, whom the application expires, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza, once again to hold its old post as the firm had no lack of discipline after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, a lot of inhabitants don't want the action to be good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de PÃºblica, brief CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to make the decision of the company:</seg>

<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have a lack of disciplining proceedings against the resellers.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the Company apparently pondered no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>

<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could give advice and to pin his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has granted to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to pay for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handele it's about an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is tired of man who is charged and finally condemned to a long sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people from East-Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmical script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely intermittance connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar's" "" "may be associated with racism usually but the word itself not automatically derive from hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as to their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with two different meanings, which have the same letter like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair will also be written on Burmese, also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, just like other words like 'Kalar PAE', 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuses Aung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">One of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">But he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the questionnaire (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it is going to reduce hate speech for more radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook should be analytical must be before it's all posts that were in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook destroys the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatic, does not understand what you write on facet-ook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the above words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "" "(age group)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread the hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "now it is time to avoid its nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship is often a cattery and mouse game, whereby the users are to start social networks, use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and me, the Liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours is prohibited, because the post "Facebook community standards did not fail."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intentions or the simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are in the country badly.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censorship these words only will bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "heralcurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the fake Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship have taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users make themselves more funny and write about the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The marriage is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously by the country to ban this practice, so that the retarding age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this amendment of the adulthood, some members hold Hindu and muscular religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harryperad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interfere with, since that, at the age of not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN-KinderConvention Center, the minors as, every man under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago, was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">2011 confirmed the official statistics office of the country that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were endeavouring to prevent laws of marriage, followed on the foot and enjoyed themselves much support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of the children's marriage, they should, be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was arguing for tension in this really complicated matter and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in the beginning of 2017 the bill of law against the child's marriage was decided, despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who contained themselves, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree with the law and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle issued on Instagram once again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill bill against children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for and no one against it was decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once he has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users had been enthralled because the laws of childhehe had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who dressed a minister in education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the heart of the thing, but know what? the marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of opinion, it was definitely long enough to lay the practice, Lara Quentre-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was at last:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:,, presentable news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The adultery has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who listened to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was noted, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The pessimissive age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious community of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment to the amendment of the adultery was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the members who were against them have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childparrot.</seg>

<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "months ago Maharaj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to accept his promises now." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the prosecutor of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, argued, it is definitely lawful that Maharaj would proceed against the law, wished for most social media users, one would address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that we would like to invite the state into our bedroom, "simply specifically talking about that the state, our daughters, protects them towards the advantage, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it is coming to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places around the world where the infancy in various gradations are legal or the norm continues, although there are laws they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia-Seite was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the US, internationally evaporated.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since over a month Turkey has now been the popular and crowdsourcing principle, encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day will become more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information, as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and journalists and fans of TV series are fighting against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically shared Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for block websites (an actual article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been posted by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, there are now several mirrorate sites (sites that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (so machine computer connections) that is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal prohibition however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the block from Wikipedia), we put everything to cover snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also involved that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansizepedi.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to hosten similar mirrorate if in the respective country in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employee at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open in Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which one can then see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia-page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around for himself, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera in itself and try to grasp the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar endeavored to bring Sagar, Nepali wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which draw attention to Nepali wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how he helps him this first-class location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Parks, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate Wildlife Photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I felt straight at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to achieve global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was tiger already standing from face to face toward:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping-time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness at home, when suddenly the king of the Buhek appeared. he immediately works, we see ourselves and it turns me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to make at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the utmost care to address the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use an oronome or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband due to social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm in order to get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state Odisha by a shame and rejected by her family and the village community, after they had approached an unmarried relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf of names, is also common among men. however, they have far less chance to fear, if any, they should not return to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health subjects, as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main focus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of its video camera, an uncovering of practices such as children's married to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Infied, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in its discussion took place, were women who did not call their husbands out by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to the names of their husbands, not to speak out loud, a bread, which they are all dupledged and never asked in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered to be left behind as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted her husband to never be named in the name of his husband, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the panel discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband outweigh for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him by now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini began its first issue lusionate.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" never before. some felt it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women were tempted to bring the discussion with a practice.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breaks of a centuries-old tradition, in the married female never to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kissed during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole angered frustration against him and his family by curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenalin rush about it, having an ancient fires having broken, the women actually try to actually try their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into his head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she tackled her, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband's husband was less understanding and the situation arised in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred spot on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would bear the castor red point, if he also acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to carrying it on him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased with it but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each Discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack up lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry who what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about whom they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, for example like our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have supported only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a Salum-Kurta, wearing a wide shirt over a trousers; they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion on the merits of their own clothes-election, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, floored Rohini to their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a panel discussion, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of the year, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly entering the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have taken only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then heard again to tell the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry on their forehead too at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discsionate lub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the eillanging for more freedom of movement or their own clothes-election - at the end of a hard-navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving themselves self-confidence, they become aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes back home and told other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally released on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published in a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese Dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community since his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "subversion," after joining the Charter of 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China described Lius case as an "an internal matter," and a spokesman told he did not need to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, release or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely cured of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman however refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's President Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 to Liu, although the Norwegian government decided that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed at the end of December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon to China because the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Since the message had spread that Liu had seriously fallen ill, the Nobel-Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Owing to his imprisonment, he was not able to take his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for China also for release Lius, as in a statement on June 30, 2014:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits you wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad shared with that the Americans wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as it may help him in his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">An spokesperson in the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary of Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27, announced that the message will release the Chinese authorities, not only Liu, but also release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The invitation of the U.S. Embassy was a furious response from China after itself, with the exterior of the State Department, that "no country has the right to interfere with an unresponsive and unresponsive remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple of followings:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of its choice, which they will be entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to insist on Liu and its wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP previously that Lius Mrs., Liu Xia, him could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that there is Liu not allowed to speak with someone outside, including its lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada demands China to protect its international human rights obligations, including free speech, to protect the freedom and exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry for China called on China in a statement on 29 June to release leu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all treatments that he, regardless of where, needed. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news transmitter France Info has already reported that the French government Liu would welcome back to the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was known that there is no further information whether France will ultimately absorb it.</seg>

<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of foreign affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Livu and call for a greater tolerance on those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>

<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, led to a harmonic, more stable, prosperous and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moving and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should Singapore be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the law of the law of the law of New York, the Ministers noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because Singapore is compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures Singapore that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shansingers were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, it appeared uninevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the central point of the theme, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear to be, leaving democrats, leave the twisted logic since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end-effect, the answers to his American guests in the last week were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judiths, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarded with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for ShanObjects, to clarify his mind, since this conclusion did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our BEK Shanets would take the effort to clear up this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing his comment on the blog, he points out about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanione, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "", "why the elections in Singapore were so inconsistent even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He forged Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leaders of a growing generation, which makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old brigade, what I expect - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, Member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes, is correctly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review depicts the weaknesses of Shanokams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanokam" "" "did a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices in Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is put to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry, I am sorry," I'm from Canada. "since 1994 I am living there and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to be polite to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clear position then the standard answer usually follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians cook perhaps inwardly in rage, if they are held for Americans but me don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag visible well on their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, a march in Iraq and September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1757">"" "we obviously say very often" "" "sorry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be considered the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">I wouldn't account for me if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, being called "nice" means to be reflection - like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has an own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which one can come across.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, take away from the things around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders' label 'is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm welcome, open kindness, which I now with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau joined the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them what rules he makes his friend.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie-Chaplin-Video "dictator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists urged the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial about how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at the videos of the video that insists on some of the political issues that Thailand has persisted in recent three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the drain section 44 of the preliminary condition, which makes the commander-in-Chief of the Healer absolute decision-making, about important national issues.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of those places in the Mexica City Tapachula, which is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexicans, a small woman with a coral-pink brilleneel and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, she knows many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) became a destination for Afrikaner and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and local immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells people coming to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on a box.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can not pay, they get rid of them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He relates that the Haitian and Africans often travel the track together and that Africans were already talking to Whatsapp from Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on builders of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mom Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," he smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez says that their guests will often send text messages when they go, to greet them or to report about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith was the powertrain of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">You don't know much about Africa but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants to travel through wallpaper.</seg>

<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Currently, 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," says he. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border to the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">Having lived for three years, he was rejected by a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>

<seg id="2036">Different from the other time it probably shared a larger cell.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one more prisoner, and must immediately sit down without having to wait for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I resorted to an old-made communication method: to beat the wall with the fist.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"" "I learned that my Zellenics was a" "" "first aid to" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he replied to me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently, in no one of the surrounding cells lay a respected man middle aged which looks similar to me and called the "doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "" "" "in the perfect darkness there are no distinctive face lifts to me, and doctors are not there; we are all just numbers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2044">All the answers are of their existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will immediately hear.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me, they would be free to leave him when I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have a scarecrow to distribute all these crows, which labelled on the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance I still hear them "" "" Eahu Akbar "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 am in the evening; always to kills this time the screams every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the Greys in person: the Raad (for example: "Donner," drawing on the 13th sure of the Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"you are here to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was established: to protect the citizens from ourselves, and prevent that we are free the traitors and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their sectarian blackboard and provoked the narrow eye-field of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, which here is not a country; it is a curse to call coexistence to transform the criminals to a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I get to the audible and treach on Abu Imad, a slim and stocky man; at least he comes before me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He begins a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions, which entail him. "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I answered not.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I used to answer it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and strokes have become an ordinary communication instrument after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said I had to get used to it, punished me, although I had nothing to do to make this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">A sentence in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He is called the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic tube, which probably comes from the cloacks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hen is beating on your letter.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry did not waste him enough, so that they exchants the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first time I asked myself whether the investigator had worked earlier as a trash collectors, or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables intertwined in order to present us from their point of view, great invention of a giant Kabels.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my feelings in my body - and my voice, which is why I stopped scream scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noted the cooling and did not find a favor, which is why he was next to an electrified Stab.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my entire body, enough to provide my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-neck body, who lay out on the floor was the perfect blackboard.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was again there.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again, let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours left, which occurred to me like minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Norwegian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time indoors; sometimes he sticks to his canvas, time to his computer, and also back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for six years now Hdaib is a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and asks their Ancient opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapist." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls on the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find relative to his hometown Amman relative, but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to the very far after Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries, and he may feel according to his own statement by man who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign imperialist intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not exist, he violates a particular disinclination to American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian vault of the second generation" - so he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own circumstances," "" "stated Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he is poured into the water of NeswcafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is planned for Muslims, to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The judicial law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the snators speak fluent coffee and the swaiter of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a view into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is difficult to avoid basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan had canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action front - the jordal branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsÃ¤nger Hamed Sinno, to resist the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press review in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was said "straight" because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that questioned the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila expressed the jordan people as a "progressive supporter of human rights" which continue to pursue "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply disguised rhetoric, but in fact a more clearly visible crystallized reality reflected in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib's traditional Gender Standards to Leibe, who formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently crushed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of 'Honorary murders' has been increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honorary members reached its zenith in 2016; however, it still impeded that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to have victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law enforcement battle of victims from 1954, women are exposed to risk-related violence, "at uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to return to subjects that are long as taboo in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, is that he is his music that is full of explicit approaches to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, Man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">But politics was invaded me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, "what one wants" - be it faith or non-faith, Hetero or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality by LGBTQ + -individuals are still heavily censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordan OnlineProgramme Roya, to remember later that his comments were swept out of the context and were censored according to his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a processed version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib buys open for the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals don't speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still alive today thanks to its homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later on behalf of the caliphes in the eighth century, could openly write homosexuality in the eighth century, why are Jordanrier not that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemial kingdom, there is nothing new more that the government is sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association, with the grounds that they could have expressed critically on the problems expressed in social media, which coincides with the deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has taken an appearance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is Hdaib - is made of slow, depressive and internal changes. he is sure that these changes occur from day to day in the heart of the Cuban Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib had dreamed as millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he did not only dreams of bringing his work by Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region helps with music, art and literature a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, extentions and artificial kind, guided democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to resist and consequently also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the largest 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warrips are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One thought it's a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the forts, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were handed over and from a time date, in the armies from west Japan in the northeast marched to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It can be hard to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for a long time the Meguro Gajoen on: two forts are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and still a breath-taking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high tower was amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where there are road raub and illegal drug trafficking every day.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region are not sure.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can produce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers, "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts engage with each other in order to show who of them can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found themselves in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people, exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training instead of poor advice in the hairstyle of art which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and their bids opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in the school preceding March, and reported about some of their achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love-Letter to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the working version of the contribution "love message to guerrilla warfare," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel free to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios, from the Young Youth Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation) that young people to write letters to guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was showcasing of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary Forces columbiens), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatories of the peace treaty than so important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the columbians a long way up until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to military rhetoric and carried around their arms around the clock, they must now reintegrate into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company, in turn, had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it has to resume their ranks and support it when building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did, until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love-ups to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters that should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi in 2014, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those who forget them need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told him to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan of writing letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life. "letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war story for a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major towns in Colombian like Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla, and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bogota Art traveled in the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC showed themselves how they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of submission of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything that is in between," the politicians told Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a collaborator of the Governor of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former combatants led me through the camp of the guerilla-fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the 'Cambuds' (a kind of hut where the guerrilla warfare, I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomeger, a deadly weapon in the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "nevertheless I spoke to him and asked:" "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I am answering it. "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pomegranches.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace rules, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"" "" "" "finally, students and some leaders of the FARC led to a discussion round together." ""</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of FARC repercussions the history of organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State of the Colombian people are experienced. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help build society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this scale, it is worthwhile to overcome all the obstacles "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard heard and had no choice, and realizing that the people I often seen as monsters, and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings, who were transformed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have been killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians was prophesy that after disarmament, peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to stand up arms, to stand up and protesting for their rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we see the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call on all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - about all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, our contribution and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic now.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after reports released after reports released in the drafting, torture and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspects queer men fortify and they hidden in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was born, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens to experience from the gender equality of their countrymen, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Because of fear for her life they moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwife, which put in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then the photos made by my documents made by the very WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying, "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on the Chechen: "how long do you want to use the family, you shabstain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke the last day in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get started and started scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I faded two keywords in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals have you been placed - in those of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, yet my male name still stands, but the doctor understood and laid me among the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got a threat.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by passing up without going through the streets; others wanted I had not changed my sex in Grosny in the official TV, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people even spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the entire Republic has damaged." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a knher around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with dark window plate and a Numbernplate with a 95 drone.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends audited the Numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I do not want to disclose their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the land, but then something seemed unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without record me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came up and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my cell.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about you, you are in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you drop. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality but this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I am still wearing some traditional Caucasian elements in my mind.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish, this emotional barrier I can not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best in order to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble as to see the person reminded of her past - that is, in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I made a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that in Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't shut a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, she probably invite those relatives before they take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even sule men stuck in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine tells me there wouldn't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives in order to place Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be recorded there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "should they be changed, you will show their bodies on television and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately pushed to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now just a presumption or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in Argun for one-half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was with himself when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise you could not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people heard of a so-called" "" "non-traditional" orientation "" "," already in the past? "" "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already in most Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "" "civil society" "", "but eventually left us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were twisted; I had colored eyelashes, carried out tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sharia never saw me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me hit.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an expression: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if they make yourself funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed, they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never sinned, never hunted, and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace held up?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the Plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak of morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people started in the city starting to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had vied and laughed earlier, regarded it at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily increases.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacup, meetings, I put it to the hospital and help them get Essenes.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I sewn sugar-variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is that nothing has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who wish to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no swamps in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the cabal, who have the Russians too, but on the entire planet there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I have been here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that they will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be here personally but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and ashamed for his own helplessness that may arise inability for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups, who want to work and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video held on YouTube was held the moments after he had behaved himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only homicide that appropriated itself in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warn of this that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights melts that this month has posted some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: they were all family-fathers who felt helpless and incapable due to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and follow a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to become a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy the power took over and 1925, undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran and some of the most sought-reaching and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets few of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disorders, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has denied the ancraazi Arabs and systematic jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness in the region and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishermen and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youths now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Directorate for Co-operation, Labour and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of the Ahwazis who completed a job, ended up at 55% a further school and have 45% university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian family activist with resident in London, told Global Voices, that the current situation, a mix of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-murder among young Ahwazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become even worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz's newly-coming ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions favored not Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be drafted access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surnames to conceal their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to become so instigated, since the Arabic name in the workplace cannot be tolerated, otherwise the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi needs to endure, suggests human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who refer themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even set out well thought of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stricter observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"" "" "" "or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women face an smoother blanket sooner or later in various areas of life and that discrimination based on sex are still drawing across the many different countries and beliefs." ""</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I leigh twice and threefold underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora, when I mention, on which way we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to stand up "their voices and" Kumbaya, "my master" to sing, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">"" "" "" "but they do not want to talk about sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two-fold manner." ""</seg>
<seg id="2450">In addition, that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin cities deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from a higher risk domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men, who have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuse to take into account the gender as well as the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere, which has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "for sojourner, 1851 in her speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is an enthumane and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb through cultural appropriation of our customs and customs to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to lie white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">"" "although the" "" "feminism" "" "was founded in order to place women of different incomes and narrow down by the white feminism, is still the word" "" "feminism" "" "in his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself full of feminism and rejoin me of the movement of Womanism, which for my dark skin and my status as a woman was called into life rather than eagerly known for a white feminist paradigm that is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres of being created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the Book Africana womangement: as we can conquer ourselves, we can define ourselves by changing our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and marginalisation after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. this article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefrubin) which reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they have nothing against Luis Balbuena, their Exallies, who had become violent towards violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship had passed some time and the police said, their statement would be placed to the ones, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena demonstrated because of failure, the acoustic indicator of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">Some days later the second woman moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women ever have an ad, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to be part of the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalation 1 beats and Statistic 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system, which does not obey unmmt3 of Paraguay: good approach, faulty implementation beats and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women really abuse - says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a socialist research institution in Paraguay. "there are various fields and reports, which, however, do not even want to indicate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the district of State Prosecutor, 9600 indicators went for domestic violence. at 70% of it it was violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads with the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace courts. even here, 86% of the adverts come from.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically effluded, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics are not showing the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's ministering in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes will actually appear. "on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic failure, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who will be refunded because of physical abuse, two women, who do not do this," "" "stated they end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">As "" "" "" since women's suicide is not an own criminal offense, the prosecutor authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2500">From August 2016 alone to August 2016, journalists have at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible offending and a judicial system, which is not doing nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then went to. this should not regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer coincide with Carlos. but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only women who happened to be underestimated, because they are deceiving themselves by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the mission of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had them isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against it and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook user asked Mariana why they had fallen for the so long of Carlos and left him not before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had a certain innocence for it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"" "Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner lives them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo-CREO (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays ads with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It carried out a process against its former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal struggle between Paraguay and her country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "" "" "the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, sees also great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼rsie).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiyaMenos (# non-notch) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law foresees to explain feminid to an independent criminal offense and punish tougher as it is already in neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was altered in some points to also win the MPs for the law, the fears that the way for decriminalisation may be billed in Paraguay that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft law foreseen to bear the majority of (bureaucratic and economic) costs, which have to bear the victims of violence at present, if they just have to look for an ad and want a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature is not providing sufficient funds for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay this abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something Normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in paraguayan Senat. however, some parts of the law had been altered. among other things, a passage has been cancelled, which the partners called for domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2551">Since then, he has been clothed, in addition to his role as a single sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Supreme Commander of Defence, Finance Minister, Secretary of State, President of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of sultans is characterized by the persisting efforts of security forces, in particular of domestic secrecy, the public freedoms, including freedom of press, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens, also activists who express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, their closing and detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which since its foundation in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site. there are two reasons for providing a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have severe consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, when building own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is director of the centralabor at the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for academic studies in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself searched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to aid the most effective health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the most effective national programme for retroretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">AGA: what do you think is the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only set solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get is often not well applicable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">AGA: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: North America and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are differently encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">AGA: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">AGA: how is the opinion of the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">AGA: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of the space, health care (non-transferable diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed things to do and the aggravated access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has served the USA salad for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant, which has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Mortons of work has been carried out only by its own resourcefulness and the question how many Salatvarieties he can get borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s he remarked that more and more Salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them on so.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents tend not only for individual sorts, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more and more such patents have been submitted to more and more plants such as grain or cartels. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representatives of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still saluted, but it doesn't need any longer, since its work is still further complicated by more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock lying in a river to get hipaddling." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we need to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition, "says he." I think these patents go far to Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stop judgment, no one can breed any more a new salatery, because all the characteristics have been patented. so he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS and have red Roman salat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyright-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit to us that others may be able to freely use seed from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders allow merely others who buy their seeds, to breed, and not immediately pronounce - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant-patent.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeriated professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in larger contexts like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter more or just little by raising seeds with natural resistance to breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified crops." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer, who want to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, the recent examples of being offered by ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, should also know that the way for example is bred on farms, should also know that the way the vegetables is cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereignty without seed-sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit to other their seeds still being free to provide them with their action in contrast to patenting seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is compromised, as the available genetic pool is due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always more limited, incalculable shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in their doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately a third of all cartels is protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or just invalue.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat are patented in a bigger scale as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from those through which their tastes or their colour improves up to those because they thrive in certain environments and withhold threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to ever more patents. genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions through climate change are much worse prior to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman in Carly Scaduto that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and the collaboration with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is set up for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, since" patents and protection of plant variables "" "." a patent is essentially taken up a plan which can follow everyone once the patent is up. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait, until a patent, is certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you must wait for a long time to breed with plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, it would have lost the struggle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>

<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents, they create most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and a blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government discontinued the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on a long-lasting report.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">To defend the Network for Human Rights Information, despite this attack and the condemning of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, to pursue these goals further, so it has never been as difficult as it is now. ANHRI is confirmed that all the technical possibilities are fully exploited to overcome the blocking and not to comply with it. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities have blocked even more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar) network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: the first human rights organization of the wave of the website imitations to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the columnisten and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no longer any access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used to use his blog for the distribution of columnists and articles that he does not write to any inaccessible web pages and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is also native to the Ziadas blog, on the other hand is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, former photographer, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and took a video like the police took physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the block by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlock is very old, however, has in the era of Abdelfatae al-Sisi priority; and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is however for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in arranging me the feeling of a siege. an arrest warrant, a rightist murder, demonstration at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Mutigen go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thyand Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this took technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE documented also the blocking of suppliers, possible by bypassing internetting and Private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the block of web pages, which began to offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content on the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also aggravated that the censors are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis, through which they can proceed from court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers report all over Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old in school" "", "" "" "Eden second day is murdered by a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diez Robben pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are allotted every day and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "this published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on 16 August," "" "It is not normal" "" "in which they announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all, however, what happens from the civilised standard, and what is happening in Rio. (...) This is our way to call, this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war-rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial writing the newspaper further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then questions arise." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose purpose is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name of "war" more than it beneficial?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil has argued the journalist of CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, to call violence as a "war." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "The most violent site in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia, is false: "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio on No. 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, emphasises the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures also was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­ficadora), one of the federal state established in the year 2003, whose objective is to conquer a favela by use of a massive police boots and a unity permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">Initially this led to a decrease of enormous death deaths. however, for a few years, the UPP provided for several reports on rail and repressions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws severe consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this demands the state to use means and ways which are typical for a war. therefore, the intrusion is in the territory of a" "" "enemy" "", "in which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape, and for" "" "collateral damage" "" "and" "" "decaying spheres" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">War along or her, fact is that the inhabitants of favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police made the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho verklomm to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence also this incident made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of kissing that the police had fallen out of a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyalist troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory, Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Forschungsinstitut The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected by the East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 challenged the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out, based on the investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these controlled areas outside Damascus have been granted under siege, which led to the population on the site or to be dependent on tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By long-standing blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas which can plant its own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the conventional, in Syria herbal foods and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine. however, their food intolerance also makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The director of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided for cultivation of fungi, because they have a high nutritional value, like meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for this project for three years and expressed its relief so much more and more "is gaining prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To raise money for the initiative, use in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alida the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12.700 â¬, but will continue until Monday, the 04. September 2017, continue to collect donations to CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that maintain temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, local fuel and plastic uses will be used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began producing" "" "production from the regions" "" "mushrooms" "" "before they check their quality and whether they are used for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. as this managed, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "faculty farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after a further 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "" "" "we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for different reasons" "" ": breach of the siege." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that are ramped in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 have been injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the last week had called for solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireoutbreaks that spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, a similar tragedy took place where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to European forestry system, which supervises the forest land by satellite photographs, in Portugal alone, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People asked why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the Bund der farmers of Portugal stated the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dirt reports of open streets, which were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened again in June as the streets were locked very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits are lagging in furnaces with a high fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide-sufficient proposal for the whale-form, which the government introduced to severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to capital.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity by case permitted, if the applicant had access to self-protection, that was an open back door, so that all could be built," leads JoÃ£o Sorval in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from slightly combustible wood, itself, as in a vicious circle, spread out to fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems came that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants were looking for information or tried to contact relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that catered the population with information: you use the application fogos.pt and informed the local population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in life to simplify the work of fire defense and was thus decisive at this fateful weekend in October so that the servers continued to the rush of 400,000 users who were persecuted, did not stand: thereby, the website counted more than half a million listings.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At this time Aperaf Barati was a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Asia, for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her Son again for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning gray was to break the boy.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugouts.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the party of Hazara-e-mail-wadate has just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban for their hatred of the Hazara were ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coal-care. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his minor salary, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of afghan refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," reminded Ashaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site that we worked also.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows that we do not refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asshark allowed his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the dangerous crossing at the sea, he suffered shipwreck and strangle on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application, A0f 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time there was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church twice a day eating at the most deprived.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high level quotas is a kind of second chance for deposited asylum seekers. it is also true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the Human Rights Organization for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seeker is housed in the more than 3000" "" "special auditions." "" "it is improvising facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center, if they have officially asked an application for asylum - which may be preferred for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have any money for accommodation, rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there is also one sheep.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unsettling lifestyle has helped ape to liberate itself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry several years ago, Ahimaf put his total savings into the formation of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran out so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a whisker.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Aael Baratis Success is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director of Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans company emerged, among them cutting, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of the Orient Experience in which the waiter and the staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and an Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Aduafs's goals go far beyond the Italian food and retail trade and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as teenager.</seg>

<seg id="2933">Users must opt to use social networks within six months after a successful legislative regulation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as by reference number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step may be sentenced to six months of sentence or of the final payment of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the law, which was applied by sixty-party members, is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of parliament and shall be debated there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another deputy appointed a legislative proposal, in which tougher penalties would be introduced to the president or a high officials.</seg>

<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian policemen, demonstrated against the military coup, which led to the bailiftment of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as there were more than 700 people, who were arrested in the same incident, four years in custody on a court appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May because the prison line according to human rights groups has failed to bring the accused of jail in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to a, so many human rights groups agree, hypoexposure of among other armed forces, illegal gathering, murder and frail murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza gave two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage to the pro-Morsi seat block on Raba's Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly who were also arrested in the previously mentioned pre-case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
