this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he noted , that the NSA inter@@ rog@@ ated illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence co @-@ operation in which the CIA had literally overcome Iran for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t work ?
the US government .
nearly 10 years the government has been determined against iron , and urged him to call its innate sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and journalists .
according to the first Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the blood that they are reasonably priced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , as the government at R@@ isen , he did something which many courageous re@@ porter did already before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something is something exceptional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although it was for years that it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government on margins were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porter and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of failing to get out and r@@ isen on the statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his telephone calls are anxious ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even travel wis@@ s with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ s are supposed to condemn .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his action , but instead the judiciary more condemned than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work than dor@@ m .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result that wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the line that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more possibilities to exclude all of them .
but just as technology has allowed the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can accept it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the testimony of witnesses .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source acquisition system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the here the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information as to any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency .
so the government cannot give more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small proportion of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are constantly developing new es@@ pi@@ onage technologies that compromise us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us that not only technology leaders like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to do mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the talk about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers modest and covered by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental co @-@ workers , the alarm led to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our whole constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 saw the largest data le@@ ck of history published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was revealing that emp@@ ty@@ ards and patron &#93; were hidden from Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; we asked by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ se@@ ca Mos@@ se@@ ca in Panama
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as mos@@ a@@ Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dict@@ ators Bashar al @-@ Assad St@@ ole firms in tax hav@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others that are nervous on the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of a Agency &apos;s website or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
yet the truth is , if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , and not all pay its taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations have been phenomenal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens , are being used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people will see this whole world very confusing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe to me .
so , one has a firm in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind this structure .
it can be very difficult for criminal offen@@ ders and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what this thing is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations , this scandal occurred .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , mosquito Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a Dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have a lot more cases and examples to see connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information , you need to specify less information to form a company than to get a reference ID .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school distri@@ cs to rip school children off .
it has allowed frau@@ ds to rip especially an@@ gled investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator existed as an African minister who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ ved it really , that all up to one lawyer &apos;s lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money .
these were all prec@@ arious meetings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anyone was given to anyone there . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , which made our secret investig@@ ator proposals .
it is not about a single top political , involved in a scandal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to keep this kind of behavior .
it may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ism , I see quite that a lot has begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen pre @-@ bre@@ aches to more transparency than concerns the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU is in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind this .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind sha@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this sort of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ consistency , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made an am@@ farm selling .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made just a road@@ trip all the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where s@@ ze you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he said that he would go to the peace@@ keeping , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning it . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ et !
this is a small suitcase !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattresses . you can sleep in my living room &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I moved to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a game of wild in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on toe @-@ tops at the door , and shut up my bed@@ room door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork that he had bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers are actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ?
to host people on my air mattresses , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I heard about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can accomo@@ date with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep in us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wood floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ ham were completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . as we rehear@@ sed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , rigid Brian and I join us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came to the roles .
my former fellow @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website that publicly post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms , whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
nobody , who is still at con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one climb@@ s on the things that one can eat well . we could be designed .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met earlier .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a valuable sample , which degree confidence we stri@@ ved .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comp@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
Thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your cell phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone your left seat .
this quietly walk from panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will sense when opening the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most are the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is for the office of the president ?
you can now return the cell phones back .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had only once introduced with his name ; if he tells , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you had 150 jud@@ gements , who all say : &quot; he can really hold very well de@@ cryp@@ ted phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ based feedback system strengthens the confidence .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to put negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guests had passed their jud@@ gements before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we analysed a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence .
little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social prejudi@@ ce .
exciting is when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three terms , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , everything is changing .
a good reputation is similarities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
moreover , we experienced that trust depends on how much you are reasonably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are talking too little like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , one tells too much , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; - the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your home ! I do my family holiday . &quot;
how can we manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ oned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay those prejudices .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which had not been covered in advance .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not all goes smoothly .
there were guests who allowed un@@ allowed parties or dwell@@ ed dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
I worked in the customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , by the 123 million there were only a fraction of the problem .
for people trusted each other to justice .
when confidence works , it can be mar@@ vel@@ ous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there , he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts took him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are a real gu@@ ardian angel who save life , even though they don &apos;t know anything .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a byp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
but it is now just a rental industry , &quot; the thing is not fair .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and this changes everything .
when you travel today , it is fast food to compare . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you have visited , a group there would be subject to otherwise fill a thoroughly and show a bar pent@@ ine tour , of which you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to build apartments from scratch ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have taken the thoughts of a common share ?
I imagine cities which give us society and relations , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started . many parking places that the government belonged .
were offered residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were taken up . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . via our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a foreig@@ ner or even hosts .
the idea thus seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
there have been similar websites to us .
so why has just our works ?
aside from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red ma@@ da is passing by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a believers ? a experts ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed , a brain @-@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with Sah@@ ne extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ gern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ rage me .
no , not as a homo@@ sexual man , just like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was the trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I perceive myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody percei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , having kno@@ cked to the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; message . &quot;
there was smoke and air@@ planes in buildings , people split out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it was not only attacked my country but in N@@ u related me the deeds of others by a citizen in a susp@@ icious susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the building of building .
I remember the way we drove -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be seen as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; are watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that one held for Muslims , war@@ ped out and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have bel@@ ted the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a mal@@ ignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ and and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will the closing of mo@@ oring America more secure ?
there will perhaps be some parking spaces but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith tolerant , and to show greater civil participation .
and as for me the police of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
with the radic@@ alization process , one has noted that it starts online . as a first , the person will cut off their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
eventually a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to your imagination , if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , it is not driving them what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently a amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . any cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she was silent and told her that her anger , her sense for the injustice in the world would bring them only in trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing inspired by nothing and something that would have existed in their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts , which promised to be a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Ima@@ m brought the connection to God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ using them for anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept before joining the IS .
it was an insight like the Islam@@ ophobia mean me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- showing : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government , con@@ formance and prejudices .
one study reveals : if one notices messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at whenever the mood against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election @-@ perio@@ dically .
so Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mozambique terror as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public in order to de@@ ca@@ vern the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
we may feel it may be the first , but the toxic air of fear hin@@ ders us all .
in assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ity , it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ ously human being , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sav@@ vy of such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after judging by Muslims on his Facebook page .
he took eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we sure to go home ?
we gaze at it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we headed up , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , went out my shoes , went to prayer , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , ath@@ e@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ced .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go by number ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ in with bor@@ row , so do an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not fool you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual how it is allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
when people appear as an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . made possible by research organisations worldwide .
before air parcel has penetr@@ ated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
together , you can reach high speed and speed up in a narro@@ west room .
you can also build on self @-@ adjustable structures .
you have learned to wear the load , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of Pos@@ sible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system works autonom@@ ously , it has to know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offspring of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on top level e. g. &apos; start off and &apos; land .
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other Star@@ r@@ amps , it is efficient in advance @-@ moving efficiently , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ te@@ ers it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a limitation of cut@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the traffic device no matter in which location the optimum position can be recovered and the performance by exercising can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which meet you to hurt you .
several decades ago @-@ driven air@@ controlled flight @-@ controlled aircraft could fly , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tro@@ eck@@ ar .
un@@ long we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ ic , the mechanical @-@ easiest aircraft @-@ device . it was invented recently .
it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folding , hing@@ es and cross @-@ pit , no further actu@@ ation or chec@@ kers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , happens in the interior live very much , so that it can fly stable and move in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the eck@@ ar . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the chance to throw it right , if everyone watch me is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon is a exercise in satisfaction , this machine is here , the om@@ el@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ists , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
there@@ for he gets the most important skill ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter which direction he is filmed , or even how to rot@@ ate .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda .
some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is getting directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that on .
when air machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against anti @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , something wrong is going wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller is falling off , electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit constra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half un@@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took a commercial micro @-@ quad@@ rant -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and provide them with loc@@ alised technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully , you motivate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there , on Broadway , wants to become a flying lamp .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a memory of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is on the cake .
thank you .
1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very distant galaxy two black holes each other always faster , they turned so the mass of thre@@ es in a tenth of a ten@@ ure in pure energy .
this short moment brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they don &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time fabric , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
first , we first arrange the events in a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1.3 billion years ago there had been a multi @-@ camp life on earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , men and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss in the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to build a giant laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise for approximately col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them they held crazy .
but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eters - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was greatly increased , which improved the output power considerably .
therefore , it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stubborn problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ector of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth through .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my deadly sick father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that , for what I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ists from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ row in the fabric of space and time .
with passing the wave , the space and its entire contents are stretched in a direction and plung@@ ed into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers often lead to rel@@ ativity dance in courses on the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory .
&quot; stretch and De@@ wat@@ ering , stretching and sm@@ el@@ ets . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on September 14th , for instance , each of us stretched out the waves and stri@@ ped out . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Dar@@ um , one declared the L@@ IG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured by less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties for the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
however , physi@@ c@@ ists are dark , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years prior to his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott pers@@ ists , L@@ IG@@ O is more of a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
that &apos;s quite handy . because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of the light coming from several points around you .
for pots is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you very much :
the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is talking Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob hangs down . &quot;
&quot; du@@ g Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can not make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by mind@@ ing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert shaft patterns to Sh@@ all , we can literally hear the universe literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
S@@ H : two black , not three @-@ round holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional audio @-@ change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ved into the wav@@ el@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he must hear , see this as the sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : think of what that means .
two black holes , the di@@ ligent body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , orbit each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it , because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O has a completely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not see .
a super nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes are happening but at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never see through as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Ur@@ g@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered through its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that most important : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we just discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O took place in the first attempt of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , which brings black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they observed are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different angle on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would say I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I start with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just that was going to do that I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , my life deeply changed , on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my beak @-@ t@@ asse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ars always to play with them as soon as you call me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side @-@ effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saved my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a true dre@@ am@@ job .
I am author . I think things go out to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I encourage television .
I do television , in grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV broadcast@@ er can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode adds all nine days to four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shifts , simultaneously in production : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday on Thursday night .
around the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I myself have created , and not only produced , so still above . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around bon@@ fires and share my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , war@@ ehouses all around the world burn .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a land or a classroom taking me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you understand that I am not just on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dreams about a dream job .
it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I go deep into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set troops on , as m@@ apped I on a canvas .
as a result , one sets a high tone , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and troubled , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is the buzz .
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
a sums of money started in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people assume , if I declare them the sums of money , that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong , this does it .
but the money -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and work and work , building , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the buzz !
the buzz is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the sums of money is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the money is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a buzz , then you can not seek otherwise than to the size .
the feeling , not to be different , than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is what we call the buzz .
or maybe it will also be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is meant to be genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know I love the buzz .
I only want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not question it .
to make a clear one : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more exagger@@ ated limits , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I was monkey , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz .
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this money ?
and then it stopped the buzz .
revised , over@@ adm@@ its , exagger@@ ated , over@@ taken .
the sums stop .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ ama is not there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were up .
the sums of the engine is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my money was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , no rever@@ ence , no repent@@ ance , no repent@@ ance , no repent@@ ance , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the money and the sums I was .
so what do you do if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ ze you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you are doing what you do to be a teacher to be a banker , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you knew the buzz , if one stops the buzz , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart sounds , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am out on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are becoming aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; guess . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; guess . &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the sol@@ itude and the lack of the summ@@ ing , I can do nothing except to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land , which I was monkey , the marathon , the w@@ run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ sm@@ al pins and the song , in which it goes to Los@@ ing , or whatever the girl in &quot; The I@@ k@@ gin &quot; release .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens to happen .
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a buzz .
and now I feel like I would know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the labour capacity , the tit@@ anium brack@@ ets , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m describing myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
the money is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on pleasure .
the real sums is dependent on love .
the buzz is the current , which comes from your lust for life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of history , the anticip@@ atory tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the true buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe whis@@ pered to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I usually do this , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not a bit like working as you work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man works rather than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I need to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we move around in the garden , in front and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we bur@@ sting soap bub@@ bles .
here I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always take a look after my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with playing ?
you can also say it ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a dre@@ amy .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my babies want to play with me a maximum of 15 minutes , until they mon@@ ds that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I replaces a puppy or bow@@ ls .
and I speak my teen@@ y @-@ daughter all 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids are ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the buzz of having a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find it out and store it yourself .
I am not perfect in it . I failed and I see . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &apos; stands shortly for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not get full 15 minutes away ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums come back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months the door opens up , the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office . I hear a UFO tune , it fulfil@@ s me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas . I use it to the full and love my work again .
I like the buzz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the buzz , the money is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my buzz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but only part of it . and I am so grateful for that .
it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money . the land , which I run , the swing , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , asp@@ iring , naked and new lifestyle in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I want to live .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more games .
ti@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am a neuro@@ surgical treatment .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have an ab@@ iding , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was done functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; deep enh@@ ancers &quot; . thereby , one im@@ pl@@ ores an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons , so that the neurological function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease causing severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pains .
but Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tant Ober@@ dentist and worked on day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is floating and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , one must reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this , sometimes one must sometimes remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing muscle mass , we decided to analyze Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells of a cell phone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can grow up , comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology tuition , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform itself into any cell ty@@ p of the body .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they slowly split up and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but held differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
it is from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big hir@@ eling cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they staying for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe it takes part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cellular source , which allows brain healing .
this was what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic section and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and afterwards mark them color in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated them to the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated the same cells into cerebral brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely sli@@ pped out , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added injury to and re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , are these little points . these are the cells we paint in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop there .
these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we orda@@ ined monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they did so well .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured the Hand@@ mot@@ echn@@ ology sector in motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed ; they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontaneously up to some degree , just like a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with plasti@@ fic@@ tional brain mechanisms . they are reco@@ vering to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted their own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now you see the cells re@@ im@@ planted , the same A@@ ffe , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use later .
we can use them in other neurological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you start clinical studies on human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time to be a lot of patience and a fast professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look to the future , how many years it will take until someone can go to hospital and that therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , one has to apply this to a multi@@ centric study .
you must first genuinely show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society .
we tend to consider her as un@@ changing guise .
we believe that capitalism is inevitably led to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have doub@@ t@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy begins with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - our elections -- not to influence austerity programs which were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who said to me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe in common with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a fall@@ acy , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy our societies are temper@@ ed , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is at present our economies .
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Parad@@ ox . &quot;
one top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , belongs to anxious to invest there , where it would be productive and income , with which to wear the debt mountain and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , in England and the euro zone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds after much money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except for the stock market and the real estate prices .
so they form debts and un@@ productive capital the Twin peaks which are not equal in common market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand , fear that they promote , in which they do not invest . just like an o@@ edi@@ pus father who would not invest out of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ ra@@ che might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ solic@@ ited the circumstances cause that O@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ ste with capitalism --
his exce@@ ed@@ ingly beautiful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I believe , but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mitig@@ ate the status of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to this out@@ puts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved with the working arms , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they give them the right to political cooperation with equal voting rights in questions of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted a long time --
like a candle , which is very bright , it is also fast spread .
however , our liberal liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the M@@ agna C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of M@@ agna C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress .
the liberal democracy occurred only when a full separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was bordered on policy while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our democracies today , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the economy and the economy is gradually approaching its politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not in the de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because one can still be in the government today and still do not believe in power because the power of politics is desc@@ ended to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ sty with capitalism .
if you pon@@ der on it , it is about just like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which thus sustain@@ ing the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , that they ended at the end therefore .
similarly , it is with the economy that has worsen@@ ed the policy so far that it is growing by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods is increasing , the inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again , and it would be better if the &apos; demos &apos; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , except from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not really good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working people regain only a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is one solution : the working people are going to do ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing Low @-@ globe @-@ employed through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the Twin Towers will be higher , the extravag@@ ance lo@@ af@@ er , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries such as China will come .
thus , we must re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and to make sure that we are making a re@@ unified field , otherwise we end in an path@@ ological monitoring @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is not whether capitalism has led the technical achievements which he has brought forth has to survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines are used and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optimistic .
so what should it be , how could it look , these &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like Utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples , some examples .
in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a working place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then , all incomes come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labor , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no substantial twin summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 biggest threshold countries &#93; , will be spent in the interest of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are scarce .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference was proposed by 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in the background of a re @-@ united politics and economics .
the world , which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together in political decisions .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not , technological development will produce such a massive decrease in the economic demand that Lar@@ ry is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is definitely relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am totally ra@@ vel .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday in the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic free zone .
in some respects , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about what the democratic development concerns .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now propose to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells giant after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many of the audience are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that that comes .
BG : yeah ...
how do you look back for the first half of six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive boost line by the euro zone exp@@ ires and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to agree on the basis of the Greek proposal - by the way , the first proposal revealed to this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to elect the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not superior to life , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism it will be delay , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is an Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
naturally , I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the finan@@ ci@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions carried out by the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to confess that they have been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika creditors , which has imposed on this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they are not survived , the em@@ itted fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for choosing TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a manager at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select some .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are at the right side of that curve .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the evaluation deals from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows you receive this review .
will your show be rated nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addic@@ ted , where , after having seen a season , ask your brain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras , -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thinking about the mean result , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guarantee success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can look at everyone for free .
and if Amazon exists in vain things , one does not attack right ?
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who absorb everything .
you realize when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you should be ski@@ pped up or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data on which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com by four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House lan@@ det by 7.5 -- something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time when another company has placed another manager a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for finding it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like , what are producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went to venture out and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they combine all of these data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in all .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you have optimised it by very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we learn more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one could ever contact with this software in this room . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this firm is used to determine whether a mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . this is not the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of rever@@ sible firms are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way can pre@@ dict -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a big news sensation . the success was published in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore .
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was once a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data is rever@@ sible to companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows in decision @-@ making in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine .
so we should prefer to make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people are uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able to make serious decisions as to make the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have known some patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
you have to solve a complex problem you do mainly two things :
as a first , you place this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a result , you put the items back together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do it several times , but there are always two things : take apart and sit again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help neutr@@ alize a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to sit back together , even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because it used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise have not been able to use . but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first , first when they chose TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say to us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
regardless of how powerful they are , data are only a tool and to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you are going to ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you only need to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will spr@@ ink@@ le it later with a lot of technology .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in the afternoon .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more cl@@ oned , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
this will perhaps be the ball rolling and wis@@ er and kl@@ ash . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I think this as a very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to be made to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
