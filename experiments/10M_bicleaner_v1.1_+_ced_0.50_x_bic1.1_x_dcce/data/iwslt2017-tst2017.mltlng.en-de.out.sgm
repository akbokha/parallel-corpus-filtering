<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he noted, that the NSA interrogated illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence co-operation in which the CIA had literally overcome Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't work?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nearly 10 years the government has been determined against iron, and urged him to call its innate sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the blood that they are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "therefore, as the government at Risen, he did something which many courageous reporter did already before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something is something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although it was for years that it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government on margins were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporter and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to get out and risen on the statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his consent, his telephone calls are anxious,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even travel wiss with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Riss are supposed to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his action, but instead the judiciary more condemned than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work than dorm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result that whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the line that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more possibilities to exclude all of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can accept it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the testimony of witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source acquisition system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is now developed from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as to any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot give more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small proportion of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new espionage technologies that compromise us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us that not only technology leaders like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to do misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The talk about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers modest and covered by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental co-workers, the alarm led to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our whole constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 saw the largest data leck of history published.] [the "Panama Papers" was revealing that emptyards and patron] were hidden from Global Witness.] [what does that mean?] we asked by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mosseca Mosseca in Panama</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as mosaFonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dictators Bashar al-Assad Stole firms in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others that are nervous on the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of a Agency's website or a John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">Yet the truth is, if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all pay its taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations have been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by a few of them to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will see this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe to me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one has a firm in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind this structure.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal offenders and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what this thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal occurred.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havens function, mosquito Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a Datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have a lot more cases and examples to see connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information, you need to specify less information to form a company than to get a reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districs to rip school children off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to rip especially angled investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator existed as an African minister who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shoved it really, that all up to one lawyer's lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all precarious meetings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anyone was given to anyone there. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, which made our secret investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top political, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to keep this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimism, I see quite that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen pre-breaches to more transparency than concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU is in central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind shakers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this sort of transparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the inconsistency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made an amfarm selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a roadtrip all the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where sze you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he said that he would go to the peacekeeping, but I don't know if he really is planning it. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazet!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small suitcase!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "uh, how to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I moved to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of wild in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on toe-tops at the door, and shut up my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers are actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people on my air mattresses, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I heard about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can accomodate with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "airmatratze and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep in us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-ham were completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. as we rehearsed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, rigid Brian and I join us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-inhabitants, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented our Investors: "we want to create a website that publicly post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still at consolation, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one climbs on the things that one can eat well. we could be designed.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met earlier.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a valuable sample, which degree confidence we strived.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your compfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly walk from panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will sense when opening the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones back.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had only once introduced with his name; if he tells, whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you had 150 judgements, who all say: "he can really hold very well decrypted phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-based feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to put negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guests had passed their judgements before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We analysed a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three terms, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, everything is changing.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we experienced that trust depends on how much you are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you are talking too little like" "" "Hi!" "", "you do not get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "as for example, one tells too much, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- "" "- the request is also rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Tolle artworks in your home! I do my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we manage to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckoned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been covered in advance.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not all goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who allowed unallowed parties or dwelled dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked in the customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, by the 123 million there were only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it can be marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there, he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are a real guardian angel who save life, even though they don't know anything.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now just a rental industry, "the thing is not fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is fast food to compare. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you have visited, a group there would be subject to otherwise fill a thoroughly and show a bar pentine tour, of which you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to build apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have taken the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which give us society and relations, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already started. many parking places that the government belonged.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were taken up. there were Incubator programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. via our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a foreigner or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea thus seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red mada is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain-washing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with Sahne extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ourage me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, just like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry Hijab, my head coverage.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified" "" "why are you oppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, having knocked to the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "message."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke and airplanes in buildings, people split out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only attacked my country but in Nu related me the deeds of others by a citizen in a suspicious suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the building of building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember the way we drove -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be seen as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "are watchful," "Seid careful,"</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather together.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that one held for Muslims, warped out and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have belted the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthand and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mooring America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will perhaps be some parking spaces but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as for me the police of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">With the radicalization process, one has noted that it starts online. as a first, the person will cut off their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Eventually a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to your imagination, if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at it, it is not driving them what they read in their" "" "Holy Bible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. any clergy with whom she had spoken, she was silent and told her that her anger, her sense for the injustice in the world would bring them only in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "nothing inspired by nothing and something that would have existed in their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalisation by extremists, which promised to be a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam brought the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight like the Islamophobia mean me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- showing: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government, conformance and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study reveals: if one notices messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at whenever the mood against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election-periodically.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mozambique terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public in order to decavern the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it may be the first, but the toxic air of fear hinders us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In assignment of collectivity, it is not just about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, much promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generously human being, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a savvy of such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after judging by Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we sure to go home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We gaze at it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we headed up, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, went out my shoes, went to prayer, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and called our guests, for half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudiced.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go by number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TEDTalk, a denkerin with borrow, so do an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not fool you. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>

<seg id="401">I am as usual how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. made possible by research organisations worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel has penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. several years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Together, you can reach high speed and speed up in a narrowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build on self-adjustable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear the load, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of Possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system works autonomously, it has to know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offspring of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on top level e. g. 'start off and' land.</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starramps, it is efficient in advance-moving efficiently, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starteers it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of cutters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the traffic device no matter in which location the optimum position can be recovered and the performance by exercising can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which meet you to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago-driven aircontrolled flight-controlled aircraft could fly, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a troeckar.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospic, the mechanical-easiest aircraft-device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, hinges and cross-pit, no further actuation or checkers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, happens in the interior live very much, so that it can fly stable and move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the eckar. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it right, if everyone watch me is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon is a exercise in satisfaction, this machine is here, the omelter with its eight propellists, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Therefor he gets the most important skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter which direction he is filmed, or even how to rotate.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is imaginable in models, the rest is getting directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When air machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"" "" "" "however, something wrong is going wrong - a motor or propeller is falling off, electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit constrained." ""</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half unairworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took a commercial micro-quadrant -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and provide them with localised technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there, on Broadway, wants to become a flying lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake is on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago circled in a very distant galaxy two black holes each other always faster, they turned so the mass of threes in a tenth of a tenure in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment brightened brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they don't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time fabric, and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">First, we first arrange the events in a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"" "" "" "about 1.3 billion years ago there had been a multi-camp life on earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, men and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss in the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise for approximately colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them they held crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized it as crazy geniuses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometers - gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO was greatly increased, which improved the output power considerably.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detector of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collized black holes through the earth through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my deadly sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that, for what I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crow in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">With passing the wave, the space and its entire contents are stretched in a direction and plunged into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers often lead to relativity dance in courses on the relativity-theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and Dewatering, stretching and smelets."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for instance, each of us stretched out the waves and striped out. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 Nulls after comma, followed by a 1 Darum, one declared the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured by less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties for the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">However, physicists are dark, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years prior to his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott persists, LIGO is more of a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite handy. because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For pots is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is talking Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob hangs down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dug Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by minding changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert shaft patterns to Shall, we can literally hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not three-round holes, circulate simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional audio-change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, engraved into the wavelform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- LIGO Folder: [Surrender of noise] Jemand, who knows what he must hear, see this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think of what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the diligent body in space, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 sones, orbit each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it, because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has a completely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are happening but at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Urgall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered through its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO took place in the first attempt of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, which brings black holes, such as LIGO they observed are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sauerknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different angle on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "we need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space." ""</seg>

<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say," "" "Yes!" "" "I would say I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just that was going to do that I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, my life deeply changed, on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all. "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my beak-tasse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swears always to play with them as soon as you call me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side-effect: only recently, I actually understood that the "" "" yes "" "" I saved my career with my children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a true dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things go out to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I encourage television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcaster can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode adds all nine days to four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollar TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shifts, simultaneously in production: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I myself have created, and not only produced, so still above. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around bonfires and share my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, warehouses all around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a land or a classroom taking me seriously if I'm talking about work so you understand that I am not just on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not dreams about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go deep into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set troops on, as mapped I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, one sets a high tone, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and troubled, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums of money started in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I declare them the sums of money, that I'm talking about writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the money -- when I started working with television production, when I began to work and work and work, building, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums of money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can not seek otherwise than to the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different, than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what we call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it will also be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is meant to be genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more exaggerated limits, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I was monkey, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this money?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stopped the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overadmits, exaggerated, overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mama is not there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "guess, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were up.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, no reverence, no repentance, no repentance, no repentance, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the money and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some people think:" "" "haze you out, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you are doing what you do to be a teacher to be a banker, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you knew the buzz, if one stops the buzz, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart sounds, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress "a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am out on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mama," "" "Are you playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are becoming aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "guess."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "guess."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama," "" "Are you playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the solitude and the lack of the summing, I can do nothing except to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I was monkey, the marathon, the wrun, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wasmal pins and the song, in which it goes to Losing, or whatever the girl in "The Ikgin" release.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens to happen.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the labour capacity, the titanium brackets, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm describing myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current, which comes from your lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of history, the anticipatory tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually do this, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not a bit like working as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what kind of man works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I need to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We move around in the garden, in front and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We bursting soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Here I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take a look after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naïve, for a dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My babies want to play with me a maximum of 15 minutes, until they monds that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaces a puppy or bowls.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak my teeny-daughter all 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids are ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz of having a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I failed and I see. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play? 'stands shortly for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get full 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months the door opens up, the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office. I hear a UFO tune, it fulfils me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas. I use it to the full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the money is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but only part of it. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the money. the land, which I run, the swing, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, aspiring, naked and new lifestyle in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I want to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Tians have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have an abiding, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was done functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "deep enhancers". thereby, one implores an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons, so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease causing severe trembling and heavy pains.</seg>
<seg id="806">But Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductant Oberdentist and worked on day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain is floating and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, sometimes one must sometimes remove a part of a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing muscle mass, we decided to analyze Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "cells of a cell phone" "" "can grow up, comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families." ""</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology tuition, that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform itself into any cell typ of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly split up and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but held differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">It is from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our big hireling cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they staying for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe it takes part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cellular source, which allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic section and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And afterwards mark them color in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimplated them to the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplated the same cells into cerebral brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely slipped out, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added injury to and reimplated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, are these little points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop there.</seg>
<seg id="864">These cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we ordained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we injured the Handmotechnology sector in motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed; they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to some degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with plastifictional brain mechanisms. they are recovering to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted their own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see the cells reimplanted, the same Affe, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neurological models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">"" "" "" "but our dream is still to implore them to humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you start clinical studies on human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time to be a lot of patience and a fast professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look to the future, how many years it will take until someone can go to hospital and that therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one has to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first genuinely show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventories of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider her as unchanging guise.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy begins with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - our elections -- not to influence austerity programs which were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who said to me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to believe in common with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a fallacy, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are tempered, our future bleak and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is at present our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, belongs to anxious to invest there, where it would be productive and income, with which to wear the debt mountain and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, in England and the euro zone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds after much money, until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except for the stock market and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So they form debts and unproductive capital the Twin peaks which are not equal in common market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand, fear that they promote, in which they do not invest. just like an oedipus father who would not invest out of fear, the prophecy of the Orache might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unsolicited the circumstances cause that Odipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haste with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly beautiful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe, but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the status of Athenian democracy due to this outputs.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved with the working arms, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they give them the right to political cooperation with equal voting rights in questions of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not lasted a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, it is also fast spread.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy occurred only when a full separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was bordered on policy while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our democracies today, there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the economy and the economy is gradually approaching its politics." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because one can still be in the government today and still do not believe in power because the power of politics is descended to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hasty with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you ponder on it, it is about just like a herd of carnivores, which thus sustaining the animals, of which they are nourished, that they ended at the end therefore.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has worsened the policy so far that it is growing by the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods is increasing, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again, and it would be better if the 'demos' keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, except from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working people regain only a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">"" "" "" "but there is one solution: the working people are going to do!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Low-globe-employed through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the Twin Towers will be higher, the extravagance loafer, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus, we must reshape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and to make sure that we are making a reunified field, otherwise we end in an pathological monitoring-hyperautocracy that lets the film "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has led the technical achievements which he has brought forth has to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix," in which machines are used and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what should it be, how could it look, these "Star Trek" like Utopia rather than the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a working place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all incomes come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labor, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no substantial twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 biggest threshold countries], will be spent in the interest of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "Cosmos" "" "and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods conference was proposed by 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a re-united politics and economics.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you is at the same time liberally, in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in dustbin of history, and keynesianese, global keynesianese.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together in political decisions.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do not, technological development will produce such a massive decrease in the economic demand that Larry is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is definitely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am totally ravel.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday in the dinner of the Redner you have said very clearly what you think from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I can say this provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now propose to do that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells giant after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many of the audience are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yeah...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive boost line by the euro zone expires and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to agree on the basis of the Greek proposal - by the way, the first proposal revealed to this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to elect the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not superior to life, through political will and authoritarianism it will be delay, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is an Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Naturally, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the financiers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions carried out by the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to confess that they have been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika creditors, which has imposed on this policy:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they are not survived, the emitted fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for choosing TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a manager at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select some.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are at the right side of that curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the evaluation deals from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows you receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will your show be rated nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows such as" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "The Wire" -- all the shows, addicted, where, after having seen a season, ask your brain: "" "" where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddler and Tiaras, -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thinking about the mean result, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guarantee success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight Candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can look at everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists in vain things, one does not attack right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who absorb everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You realize when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you should be skipped up or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data on which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from it the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom by four Republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 amounts and Alpha House landet by 7.5 -- something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time when another company has placed another manager a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for finding it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data via the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like, what are producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went to venture out and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine all of these data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You have optimised it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is something frightening because we live in a time when we learn more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one could ever contact with this software in this room. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this firm is used to determine whether a missal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not the fact that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of reversible firms are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way can predict -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big news sensation. the success was published in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was once a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is reversible to companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows in decision-making in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people are unimaginable to make serious decisions as to make the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have known some patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve a complex problem you do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, you place this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a result, you put the items back together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do it several times, but there are always two things: take apart and sit again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help neutralize a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to sit back together, even if the information is incomplete in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because it used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise have not been able to use. but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions first, first when they chose TV-ideas, then as they chose" "" "Alpha House" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say to us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Regardless of how powerful they are, data are only a tool and to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you are going to...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you only need to shake the ball in order to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will sprinkle it later with a lot of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more cloned, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This will perhaps be the ball rolling and wiser and klash. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think this as a very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to be made to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
