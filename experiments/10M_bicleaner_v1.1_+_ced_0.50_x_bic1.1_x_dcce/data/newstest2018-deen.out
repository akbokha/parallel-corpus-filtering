Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt , where people should meet young people today .
a hollow chapel , where now stands for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the ein@@ sty cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
this knows everyone who had to catch the upright , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow rather than a byp@@ ass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Geo @-@ Portal Office of the State Government , are anything but up to date - yet very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it will be clear how towns and churches in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one does not recognize as such .
in the large coverage map there were more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine he@@ ets .
these were produced according to the Bav@@ arian State Department , between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and exp@@ elled out of the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops dropped off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours were the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ measurable administration .
the Court of exposure for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 , and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian State Library .
the comparison of the morning / Today is the example of the state capital on the op@@ pressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was formed 21 years after the card &apos;s dra@@ fting , so 1877 , classified as a Munich district .
today , Sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ scoring is located around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at Hin@@ einz@@ omen a smaller card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ up@@ take &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the tax tax . &quot; &quot; &quot;
small plots occupy themselves no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 places of the October fes@@ ts , was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the appointment of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , it reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or of the level &quot; On the Death &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , one once belonged to people with ins@@ anity exhibitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard was headed by Gu@@ dden , the institution - that psychi@@ atr@@ ist who is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive in his time and ended for example the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he has banned the personnel to apply force against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who occupied himself an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 sites .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is located there since 2006 , one of the largest psychi@@ atr@@ ists in Germany .
now , at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt are now meeting young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and moved him to a youth home with educational training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings dating back to the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created in the architectural holding on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was m@@ apped by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchant road was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies were in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big stayed to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a hollow chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are working and take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn series .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and to fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group published Travel @-@ Reports for Mis@@ souri
the national association for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ souri by the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , which will bring special attention to the country until 28 August 2017 , because a series of frag@@ mented , racial cases occur at the last time in the entire state and here , &quot; said it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , which are dis@@ proportionate to minorities , the group , the group , said the NA@@ AC@@ P , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights that humans happen .
they are stopped or killed because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist jun@@ kers against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after spending any gasoline during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri , without being accused of crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Mis@@ souri , in which it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than White .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring the money , or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri , in 2015 , posted 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI , the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult to stand a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ation Association ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona , after the states passed immigration legislation to prosec@@ ute the local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to the opinion of the AC@@ L@@ U to further cat@@ ers .
travel arrangements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
consecr@@ ated project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ son Wei@@ de@@ mag@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter white and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac took a picture on the spot .
at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ demann Family , representatives of the fishing bacher CD@@ U town , together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann granted first insights into its operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , forty milk @-@ cows , and as many young animals , and houses five apartments in the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black @-@ goat milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is responsible for him from an alternative res@@ hap@@ haz@@ ard way for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ally .
as he also is the BL@@ H@@ V President of Fis@@ bach , he described the &quot; elementary &quot; project as a &quot; elementary &quot; project . &quot;
I can not succeed on such steep surfaces .
the green area for much work , much must be edited with the motorcycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and run it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the meaning of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be gone through quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor .
farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure area is about 40 hectares , which may not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euros , a quarter carried by the community fishing bach .
thus , the farmers work 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres past@@ ure .
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it makes a really good job , without farmers and women it does not go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter We@@ iss is firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ ego@@ at ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of de@@ mar@@ sh@@ es .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the requirement is the presence of one of the L@@ PR designated convey@@ or products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the non @-@ smoking area may not be in@@ pper@@ y ( H@@ ang@@ ulation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fishing year Wei@@ dec@@ eit Project 2018 , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometers fence .
the moderate @-@ area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cal@@ med costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the safest character of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly did what he did when he had a symbolic A@@ xt in an heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller is not resor@@ ting to the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have spar@@ ked him if he had done it .
but it resor@@ ted to its significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that enligh@@ ten the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem you refer to , which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly properly properly , but as he beha@@ ved it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your ti@@ ts , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses who are trying to breathe free , the el@@ ving waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our monitors .
Miller got not engaged in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who put themselves on the basis of placing their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female embodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical cinem@@ atic representation .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract , she has got a voice .
and there is herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vism .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to move it back for a long time .
the great scre@@ aming as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one @-@ invite , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on , who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
it should wear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the road to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something across .
the significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus consisted of seeing them as they were from the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips to the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
the true sense is to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue talks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that will ever recognize Miller and Tr@@ ump .
its tor@@ ch should not light the path , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves the team of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; said black .
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British L@@ eich@@ ta@@ si@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew but@@ chart - which are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected from the crew to team capacity .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or whatever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie quite naturally brought , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal , which is due to its fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes on the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ hill Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch for a great season , which was to win the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world champi@@ onships , as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team member states that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men belong not only to the team but sometimes in the medals and in the Fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very special about the team of the team that she was elected by the other members of the team so it was a great honor to know , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose to make it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ diums .
what my speech as a captain is concerned ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home@@ work and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : take not a public office if you cannot wear the hei@@ ms of voters .
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of all , from domestic policy up to its political principles .
he in@@ filtr@@ ated with the cri@@ tiques , safely .
but he was not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led as sheep to the battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland under Governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work to be more like Washington .
high @-@ go@@ ose employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ als promised him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rod of Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the on @-@ line comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ que Governor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state that is amazing .
he has the highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State , and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with its constitu@@ ents and to debate his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy in his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of people who come to the page of Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of Govern@@ ors and argued that the Com@@ position of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the image of dri@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ash @-@ filled people online the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ men and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thou@@ ght@@ fully and not prof@@ essors .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyers at the Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ash@@ ish , but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary sector of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take on the same topic , then they are dis@@ respected by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the government of the Govern@@ ors signed in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spam attack , others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era is easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that staff were sent to gather newspapers with critical guides and to burn or burn prot@@ esters and sil@@ enced .
but that is exactly what is happening on digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official so he critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump will be compl@@ ained from Twitter users who were blocked from Twitter feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue fell into Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they named a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time , Washington has had a similar impact on the time of affordable prices , such as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envel@@ opes to his leadership .
and even back then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms , such as &quot; Jur@@ ists , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote , wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , came on his ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not been sil@@ enced .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days based on domestic comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosts the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led last year next door in Arch@@ er@@ field left until the end @-@ session , before it lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous fe@@ ather of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels especially noticeable , &quot; said the player found in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and there was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the ground .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid Gulf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how far it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio at the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six guns on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking fee costs £ 5 per car with a car and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .

in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive lung cancer .
at this result scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) is published in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates published in 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases on passive exposure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he came up with an own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there were still 400 lung cancer cases for pas@@ si@@ re accidents a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ sions prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; somewhat smaller in time , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as is in the sub@@ strate much mo@@ ist , which does not notice in the plans .
the traffic , which has repeatedly ham@@ pered the construction work for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p is a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists before red lights and lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the line buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been employed for weeks with the works on the bridge .
&quot; the hot days were quite ti@@ ring .
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use stove .
it even uses only rarely a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ is in the un@@ troubled Indones@@ ian Province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually describes a sweet potato - locally as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the hung@@ arian tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on Leh@@ ism - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bu@@ cket in a roof@@ less space serves as a lat@@ ch .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned to her no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usually common .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villagers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around at 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1.@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ dest would vote in front of the occupation forces in 1969 .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , turned rapidly to the government of Jak@@ arta which maintains control over the region and exclude foreign journalists or legal observing thereof .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with an independent part of Papua New Guinea , occupied the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo fence , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that have been converted through r@@ ust into several yel@@ low@@ ly notes .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , so@@ y because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans called a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their animated , handmade tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and its bright rock .
&quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ anti@@ les and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , grass @-@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ par@@ amount in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has reduced gold and copper in the year 2015 .
in addition , Papua over wood resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indones@@ ian military has been empower@@ ing military presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port has paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , among them up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and are being treated mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to data activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tor@@ tured and incar@@ cer@@ ated .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ 1980s were committed to the Asia @-@ Human Commission for genocide .
in the region , the Indones@@ ian police held more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to call on everything that is included in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from 2016 , in which reports about atrocities and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal down@@ fall of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have reinforced themselves , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring resources from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Cant@@ on sell ro@@ ast chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ ts .
local people will fight for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work .
&quot; it has the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the inequalities and the legal violations of Papua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann reached 27 of the total of 29 suburbs of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered just two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas songs in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark .
the ro@@ cked children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impetus to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , and did the group with their enemies , told the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so difficult to put that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground before the local police station and the military force center to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial fighters and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a Vogel@@ str@@ ang im@@ iti@@ zing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstrators began to drag stones at police and military out@@ post .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command through an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; it is in an official document of T@@ IME that was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his colorful be@@ m@@ wood wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but tells the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indones@@ ians only a name , the T@@ IME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Papua &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ porter said that his officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back their station only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to be attacked because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many other demonstrators were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and v@@ owed to address the historic abnormalities of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out a court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ 90s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have ple@@ dged to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the anto made a retreat , when he referred to T@@ IME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he did not have any plans in Papua a complaint mechanism .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which accused the United Nations because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been reported , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims killed such claims with fierce unbelie@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed at four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten out of the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; says he .
the shooting shops have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring a mind to a mind , died a person and 17 others have been injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ ble@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ is@@ cated in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
semi @-@ finished villagers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s local office .
the police said that the villagers were stones on officers , who reacted to it by sha@@ ded warnings .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( ind@@ ones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured was delivered here quickly , so the T@@ IME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a lack of trouble for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensual development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the former members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ land of Papua .
many closed the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , who is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a co@@ ded only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian r@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire arrived in larger numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region will usually go to the better educated and prosperous migrants .
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own business competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is Elec@@ tions have been made to raise the limitations of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indones@@ ian un@@ troubled provinces from Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government largely remains limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March the six Pacific states called Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dis@@ missed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him . &quot; We want liberty , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say that they probably will not agree again for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai nuts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in im@@ pover@@ ished educational and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Papua , their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation led to the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ In@@ flu@@ ff : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain precisely across the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible have forgotten their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with ges@@ ted head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dwelling towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years by the high @-@ house that you don &apos;t call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with fire @-@ alert and scre@@ aming the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident called his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building picked off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said it work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can have questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of skyscrapers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the out@@ dress for decoration or isolation , came .
Britain said the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell @-@ tower in June to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des could have contributed to which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the intended for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis @-@ Cup single , was only supported to play two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ sk@@ inn@@ y does not support the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
the fact that is often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics will remain the traditional value .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F @-@ president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , it was not until the vote had come before the proposal to carry the final at a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host law in the first round in the next round .
to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training courses are easier and the players will have to pass under the Davis Cup less official media schedules .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers make forbidden items in the plane , finds a survey
a survey shown below flight pass@@ codes revealed that over 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously banned items to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration have gone down , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft while they accidentally bore kni@@ ves kni@@ ves , or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they could have been delayed that they may have traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ter Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ respect the rules .
by the respondents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items which were inten@@ tionally subject to T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent gave up , know@@ ingly have carried properly objects with blades through the security control , while 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respondents , and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they were obviously imposed on forbidden drugs in the aircraft .
the company said , I have asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many cute smug@@ glers were brought about by the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people , most likely smug@@ gling , un@@ know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - by security carry out those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of it .
it is thus no surprise that the largest amount of liquids caused by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items are forbidden .
for a while people thought the T@@ SA could see books as a smug@@ gling .
liquids is permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers to cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thou@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k prints gladly with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far agreed that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales growth and even more giant sales objectives , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k told a different , less gl@@ it@@ ching number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k applied often with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in recent months , its delivery just started .
now the Mus@@ k has a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 has already been re@@ trac@@ ted again .
critics have always pointed out that this is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
with a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation rep@@ ay@@ ment &apos; completely .
currently there are 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , the Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders might be a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production site .
Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered last year .
2018 should it be used - all models together - 500,000 new@@ ton , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations every day .
those who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be reck@@ oned at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never ever tested in practice , with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions from the Obama @-@ Era rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing air@@ strikes .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities to act faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a federal state court .
it is a deadline , which was dra@@ fted on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announce that he will delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or impe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeated repe@@ ats to blocking or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month a Federal Constitutional Court in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ anol .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his about @-@ face at O@@ zone standards has simply been the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , the EPA often did not adhere to the deadlines for the execution and then waiting to be indicted by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and subsequently committed to agreement for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who promised EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion said that P@@ ru@@ itt sometime his &quot; authority to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delay and all other legally available fully @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive ren@@ dition of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month of the bill is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years .
the measure was not made available in the Senate .
the New Yorker &apos;s general contractor , Eric T@@ tail@@ oring , who led the coalition of the states that had compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - after our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and that are over 115 million Americans who are directly streams from smo@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said tail@@ oring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil raff@@ in@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the extru@@ ded smo@@ g can cause serious problems of people seriously causing serious problems , and each year contribute to thousands of premature death .
representatives of the public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itts in a surprising change of direction .
&quot; it is dist@@ res@@ sing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the dump government to raise environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church

the wording of the certificate on the tum@@ our mountain , apart from the former parish church , besides the former parish church , was also a glori@@ fied courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that is now still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ fication center of the village .
ancient cards from the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin this historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was created right from the early medieval peculi@@ arities .
a Lord , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to susp@@ end this peculi@@ arity .
in doing so , the right to a priest , or the Bishop was able to propose a new parish .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells in the tower .

the newly created bell set for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 later in the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plate were stolen and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was im@@ tight .

until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from hear@@ k@@ ering .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ d church broke off .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m you left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 , a storm in Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half stor@@ med .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower became dis@@ car@@ ded .
only today &apos;s existing tower remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .

society wants to test permission from wind @-@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal conditions for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ den &quot; has requested land rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to the Schwal@@ m@@ tal have existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time causing the concentration of wind use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should avoid a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city was four days before , by a change in the surface area plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided - however , the Düsseldorf government had not approved Düsseldorf , because of a design failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal conditions , the appro@@ vals is still un@@ lawful ) and that is why Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city Council again adopted the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette in front of the summer break ; a permit of the District government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines were excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been made in the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes them on the occasion to check the matter again .
but they are not likely to lead that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express cont@@ ent@@ edly for the argum@@ entation of the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four metres high on the construction of four meters high on the construction of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
already last year the company had been involved in which the city is four @-@ medi@@ ocr@@ e , with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand is to be covered by approximately 11 400 households - this is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re is going to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was Vier@@ sen town , green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and participating in a Win@@ den@@ ergi@@ c plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : Frau dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between precip@@ itation men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two other people were slightly wounded .
the Landes@@ straße remained locked over hours .
after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch had their car with their car in the context of the accompanied driving with their 53 @-@ year mother as an esc@@ ort the L 3@@ 33 in direction of Bo@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; city and traders plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping area in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city center .
as the leader of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; was designed to raise awareness of which offers the own city , away from the usual supermarket goods .
thus , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their educational opportunities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the business of the city should invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ self @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shopping at night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action takes place not only on inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
city administration and commercial transactions cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
this concludes the commercial club and the city into a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offers like the first &quot; Ak@@ tiv day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with all trading operators and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the susp@@ end to parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ arranged anew or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals also had lost the city center while shopping out of the sight .
in the end , everyone must help rein@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - to landlords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was en@@ rol@@ ment to overcome the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that had partly broad@@ ened , had made king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared with that Germany is the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gia towns .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lighter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote value &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the fe@@ eder of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction , there came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new additional people have been injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine others have been injured , some of them hard .
according to the fire@@ brig@@ ade was closed on Wednesday ( local time ) still a hur@@ ried in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
one first missed later was also dead .
at the dead there were employees of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as un@@ successful , the authorities expect work on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the vacation time , there were only a few people in the building of the Minne@@ haha Academy .
Tr@@ ump continued after penetr@@ ated trans@@ crip@@ ts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump urged to stop at a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president seized him , because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . saying , he said to him , &quot; You can not tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am to leave Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also released and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; mis@@ ses , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was taught by the Obama administration , after he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists are holding rac@@ ist cla@@ ws as a call for justice again &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ Benz Ford Mercury was carried out by a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block its way .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle aged in a needle - took a long turn to his cig@@ ar and looked forward by the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ doors in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; dis@@ appearing the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
sh@@ out torn the silence , when a young black man was torn away from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene has been played on 22 July , only a post @-@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when then a loop is thrown around the throat by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience got very real sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizen &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were found in 1946 by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really unbelievable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see it in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post @-@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ tigation laying down a du@@ et on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI A@@ ds , who were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding areas were suspected in the mo@@ on@@ process .
but none has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch action throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 made possible a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer .
at about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI , Roger Col@@ com , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby she carried , did not originate from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder of the murder , and has decei@@ ved the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks was still form@@ ulate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a voting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade ago Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual retro@@ position of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vivid , att@@ acking , and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s difficult to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we then are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and loud , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ it co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ d for years , but he said the role will never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story on life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -@@ -- he , conce@@ aled by my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona recovered the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs the lau@@ d .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
it is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still persistent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n -@@ -- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; wit@@ ty one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only have to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Billi@@ e Holidays griev@@ ances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of approximately four dozen spectators welding and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to watch the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as moisture there , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de , the air feels donated to the air .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity one to get closer and insp@@ ects the cor@@ pse .
children squ@@ at on their heads , sign the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wants to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that has played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona cont@@ ours two his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done it for one reason . &quot;
later the audience begins with the actors for dinner .
at a table chat@@ ting a white pair from Atlanta excited about the re @-@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you themselves and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks farm holds on his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he was already beginning to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the position is inspiring in some ways because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own story , whoever does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

brutal the scene , when he sm@@ elled Sie@@ g@@ fried .

the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .

big applause are available for the festival bands , which shows for the first time on the stage - in the face of the great heat in more ease of time .
with tension was expected the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regional Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after 2013 , he had to leave a stor@@ eyed concert for 2013 , there were five years later big mu@@ bel in which the spi@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perspective .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they are working in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in furniture , once a week I will help you in Gre@@ ves in the Fur@@ niture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a later volunteer .
how does it come about ?
quantity : I have made a high school diploma .
and then an engineer studying , we say once , successfully canc@@ eled .
I realized for me that there is mis@@ carriage to me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I wondered what are you doing .
make a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it &apos;s on site , on the spot perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester in the winter semester .
I will dual dual , do probably make a social work training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not unusual , during voluntary service to have several different areas of application ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes along where to get his FS@@ J .
it can be done from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , i.e. in afternoon care .
for me that was exactly what has irrit@@ ated me .
I could see and see my own strengths as it really runs .
different from civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about comp@@ utation .
one always has another human head over and over again , each of which has a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been collected from the family - one must always take care of it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : therefore I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but so life is just .
Pear@@ son l@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut out more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will start to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced .
the job @-@ building , the General Director John Fall@@ on , initially announced for late 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to his previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 places .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme for a reduction of more than 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to re @-@ rev@@ itali@@ ze a store that was made by quick advance towards the digital learning process .
the company , which last month had sold its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half .
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed on suicide attack
a suicide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , one soldiers of Nato , and several others wounded , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been violated , shared an explanation of Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also died three civilians .
the bombing is the last of violence that Afghanistan has made this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ b@@ lasted two people near the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato it is said to happen the blast from Thursday evening was to be attacked as a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army of a &quot; of persons impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of Bagh@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagh@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which approximately 20 % in the capital .
end of July a suicide @-@ highway cover at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a da@@ unting bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed over 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops station@@ ed in power by the Taliban .
the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump would be considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the tu@@ g rule to suits around
the American environmental protection authority has made a decision to wai@@ ve a regulation of the Government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obligated to disp@@ ose of the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries declared the agency because of the pac@@ em@@ aker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive the decision called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone @-@ 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA and Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June the EPA had announced the intention of EPA to determine o@@ zone regulations in which in a part of the country would be measured to determine where inc@@ isions must adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , reached on Tuesday and said that the endeavor was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental rules , which the former president of Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which should stimulate economic growth , according to tr@@ ump economic growth .
however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves groups which are worried about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and reinforce the respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
community @-@ community wants common space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parties , the com@@ mons of flu@@ orn wind turbines the establishment of a joint space in the future seniors .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the piece was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although I &apos;m still going to last until now the church community is part of the church ownership , but there is no plan of planning for the project developed by a private investor .
for this there is a discussion regarding a common space .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Joint Council were so@@ aked in front of such a common area just as meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living area , but open into the community .
as an example made the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the decision has been decided by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common area would be , so reports T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
the decision to signal , in order to signal the investor to signal it in this respect is no bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both the saddle stit@@ ching - what reduces the fo@@ oting and the construction of economic power - is possible .
need@@ less , so do not just mean Wil@@ fried sole , be this supplement .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes on the panel .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of his own buildings with whom you are not going to be so right now , but they are now sitting at the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I make me difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ ve definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it is behind this a covered Sub@@ si@@ pping at any rate of high power or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the purchase of the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real , in doubt , is the opposite address .
stadium request , to raise the decision @-@ charge accordingly , finds three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision so we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the last one was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believe in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .

in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z , the federal system is supposed to arise .
this plans the association Stern@@ warte San Andre@@ as@@ berg .
an planet planet is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the information needs of many har@@ ass@@ ers called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connecting nature , science , movement and sports performance .
members want to set up the planned route on the planned route and inform them on stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning to finish well in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ question weigh@@ ed St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ eh and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore at the location of the site , a good mobile net reception plays a role .
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the Star@@ path train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned how stars would have different colors or why a star gets more light than another , although it is far further away .
also gives me a conv@@ eys , in which constellation can be a chosen star and when it is best to see .
the association has already operates in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z park is one of the six dark@@ est regions of Germany to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andromeda @-@ galaxy were clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the uni @-@ city , since 2003 the Planet@@ arium Di@@ ary Di@@ ary Di@@ et is something similar to the planned star@@ tup - the planet planet .
beginning before Geb@@ hardt Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community Right ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the St@@ els with the individual planet - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks as to a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is at least 70 centi@@ meters away from the sun .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light of sun takes up to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestrian is therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fi@@ x@@ stern but would last even half a year .

&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to be down to light weight .
and it has to move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; bo@@ xing &quot; needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who are also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight tool in the forum on September 23 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key .

four injured after tire plat@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon four people were badly injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information the driver dropped from a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira for 16.@@ 30 p.m. , just before the connection point of the market , presumably after a tyre plat@@ zer , the control over his vehicle .
the passenger drove to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ struck himself and then stayed on the roof in the green ro@@ am .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the past through the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 was suspended in the direction of North for about an hour , afterwards the traffic could be subject to the accident at the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; triangles work better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 for the season op@@ ener to Braunschweig , that the optimization of the resistance formation in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first seasonal play was Andre Hoffmann satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites to much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangles is to continue to be optimized further .
and a gate according to a vac@@ ancy , the Fort@@ unas also want to catch no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that none more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will focus on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better to cope with the thirty @-@ cat experience after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ cat .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helmet Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is himself for his cause , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ck@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we do not better harmon@@ ize and we cannot afford so many failures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , drives Hoffmann to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ lun@@ ar start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the season evaluated only six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helmet treasure , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension fav@@ ored into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are as lighter favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we take them away only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is ble@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games thoroughly positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to hit in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one such statement would be arrogan@@ t and over@@ he@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so he will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ ens@@ ory medic@@ ament has started with the implementation of the test last year .
in the asylum process , they should be more precise during the asylum process after the Swedish migration ( migration cuts ) due to errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised .
until today , Migration of 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test@@ ament and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may possibly be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to last months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers over his age has existed .
in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the person studied 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , they found that in the 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee ben@@ ds are made , which are then analyzed by tooth@@ ed and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
an skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were used sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very unsafe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is un@@ true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lie@@ ber , builders at the Department of Transport and Transport in the Prime Minister Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the works began at all three re@@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and will be sure that the schedule is observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is clo@@ th@@ ed with red bun@@ ts@@ stone and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges too , it has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three construction works will now be thoroughly rest@@ or@@ ised .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red bun@@ kers .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a boundary attachment that is also used as a farm .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge can be inserted on Friday .
and then the Foot@@ path should be gone .
the particular thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge of the bridge .

Af@@ ak in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so often that parties are pulling in the same way , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ ak ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the represented parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows the flag at this day because the Af@@ for@@ emen invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to the noisy poster &quot; large election campaigns . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top @-@ president for the presidential election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ emen , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ for@@ ter event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture , that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; age German potato salad , which also could eat the Af@@ for@@ a problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him with us .
the police has reg@@ ained many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she shows presence especially at the station , which is just a few meters from the venues .
how has the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes are reported by the Af@@ for@@ volcanoes , he made an effort to try this event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ in @-@ house , there are not enough parking spaces available .
now the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ o is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse editorial , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ for@@ ian @-@ chair Uwe Young .
in the hall are about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the top can@@ did@@ atin for the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches .
unchanged is the police site , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ T event takes place , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short notice after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can dis@@ locate - no special incidents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kr@@ isten Stewart completely open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I bite once in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ l@@ dra stars was the one of her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who finally came up bitter .

governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump in that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democrats have been away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ think ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement in the West Virginia Rall@@ ye previously .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not approve the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes establishes that he possesses coal mining in five states and inherited a carbon business by his father .

in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation , in which it said , &quot; The Party of Party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democr@@ atisation party , which would rather hin@@ ders us as to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least lawful bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without a guide and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be resumed in sports .
Russia &apos;s L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were picked up with competitions Gold@@ - and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress has agreed to maintain the ban , which was exp@@ elled in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and everything is done to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the principle of the principle was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added
ninete@@ en Russian athletes are competing in the athle@@ tics World Championships which start Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dro@@ gent@@ tests are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London following a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the yet un@@ clarified context , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to be against this highest victim in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of whom we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

traditionally , the Danish monarchy was buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already provided a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , he was further in the communication .
where prince Hen@@ rik bury , be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a secret to make sure that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he went on retirement and also lays the title of &quot; prin@@ t@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
da Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , called L@@ ene b@@ by , chief of the Danish monarchy .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .

on the Thames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of people had ever fled , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years of rain with the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my D@@ än@@ isch was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ing@@ es instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ley , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and have had the reputation to have the reputation of a society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from possible majority in Lower Saxony
proper Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re@@ election of the country , but he does not want to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the original res@@ ignation of a Green MEP in Lower Saxony had plung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the Sunday @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce ein @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its electoral circle in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U faction of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its group to accommodate them .
hence , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats at the low @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was the other way round .
the new landing day will be regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could be ruling in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l is essential for it , however , that the country has as rapidly described its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to vote on its next action on Tuesday .
state Constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister decides the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be thoroughly insp@@ ected under &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy worker himself emphasized : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the slo@@ ped de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s bankrupt@@ cy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally go out that she has received her country house at an immediate effect , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the govern@@ ors of Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there was no differences of content , we cannot grasp this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Registrar : Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the remains of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ anya to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MEP in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Government of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) to re @-@ elect the country quickly .
the leaving Tw@@ ist cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its final van@@ ity and in its frustration its personal interests primarily against the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U is involved in Lower Saxony this dirty In@@ tri@@ but@@ cher and tries to strike it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
proper CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its parliament@@ arians to record El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw his jack@@ ets , with personal career , the outcome of the Sunday @-@ election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strongest power , SPD and Green Party in the country , but a detached majority of one voice .
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressure .
at the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the most recent information about the eggs @-@ Char@@ ge concerned .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities in close exchange with the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just the same way the manufacturers are concerned about ensuring that the sold products are capable of traffic and are not harmless .
if at eggs of the resi@@ dual content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ compatible .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the high level of knowledge , the factories makes no immediate fault .
rather , due to pres@@ ump@@ tive illegal practices of service companies , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damages .
as always there is too little controversy in the harvest .
is there missing only on the staff or at the appropriate jurisdiction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes are available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made many times clear that I expect a seamless education by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm for food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and limited foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide used in the food industry , consumer and consumers are rightly indign@@ ant .
due to the caused means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide in@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of living food products is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is elu@@ ci@@ dated quickly and un@@ sett@@ lessly .
how to impact financial rules of football on ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world &apos;s world @-@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , as the leading organization monitoring the European game has to ban the power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G will eventually show that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money is loos@@ ening , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the support of the team by the energy of the wealthy ruler of Qatar .
associations must exp@@ el a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but need to be controlled with legitimate use sources , which give them the break @-@ up point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and risky to ruin , if banks or owners have rec@@ eded their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to a tougher path .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ free period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini was fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so the exchange rates for the next five years can be reported in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has been the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are held for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to over@@ list their financial supervision by b@@ lown their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ings should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply as legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A ruled that the value of the sponsor of P@@ SA was sm@@ iled by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar Pay@@ ments to the Organ@@ ic Committee of the World Cup 2006 could be held in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar F@@ WC will be arrested and a such man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators can be easily found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will still be more open , every attempt to adhere to the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than EUR 10 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ ar purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s crossing by claiming that PS@@ G would inj@@ ure the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and it has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing Fair@@ play because you can have different routes or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is in Search of a New Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board @-@ chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now , the s@@ lugg@@ ish collaboration is in front of a possible conclusion : the airline is writing the order again .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ ak in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
in the first half of the year , the Air@@ line will release a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would have checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white scr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ts spread over 14 grams a year before landing at the passengers .
at the cost of the cost , Swiss does not want to provide any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ sider appreciate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter reaches annual revenue of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , more important is the advertising effect . for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants are present at the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper Report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty on spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA the biggest Swiss chocolate producers did not reach for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was built in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo took Swiss before two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies are pampered by the Con@@ fis@@ her jumps , in the Business Class n@@ ag passengers S@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ gr@@ ame ( The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd lob@@ or ( it enth@@ uses an original story for promising D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by br@@ acing themselves on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle age play hor@@ ny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to gain the possibility of winning the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adults , who are now playing adults , is less emotional , and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the plumage , including a reef for the Stal@@ ker films of the ra@@ dle , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle , &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at a point browse a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ignant pair involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ ended impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the Ex@@ c@@ ations are the best part of the franchise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ eb@@ ook@@ ah of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
they are the moments of random madness , which might take this franchise , like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches this what I see as his logical conclusion : &apos; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist Years &apos; , whose last scene will show the gang on how to visit the fil@@ tering from &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ te @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy made by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the protagon@@ ist - a hard s@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a specialist producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to look ( the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans do it maybe with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ man - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who bears a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one .
in six long episodes it turns out , and the com@@ edy is not quick or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was found on a lower length , could provide his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f again visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ ouring a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the refined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a job .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators did not complain wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
hit against drugs and ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black @-@ Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched out , such as the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 Res@@ ults were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and issued an arrest warran@@ t for arrest warran@@ t .
in addition , the officials provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , ra@@ ging weapons , and several hundreds of thousand Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ icious Italians , there were German arrest warran@@ t .
therefore , the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bav@@ arian investigations were involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia being organised criminals , severe violence , pat@@ ron@@ eous murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already since summer 2016 the prosec@@ utor has been established against organised drugs in South @-@ Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the prosec@@ utor ties in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , an inspir@@ ational exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore the major effort on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
he came back to the vision of investigations especially Italian national with a close connection to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , during the early morning several shots were ch@@ ased into a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account of the gang .
fashion lam@@ ented large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany indicates significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum proceedings .
the defend@@ ant for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has made attention to a media report according to large gaps in the country of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the existing registered data could lead to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register there are according to ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , data quality in parts has not been well so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens , who have become German citizens and are actually no longer involved in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data flows can slow down returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it to the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about travelling human people , the EU citizens who have not had to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false arrangements led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with travelling funding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the Federal Government is now beginning to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to return to Italy when they entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will emerge from an internal paper of the federal budget for migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cher Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that BAM@@ F carry out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state that they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can res@@ train him back to the travelling country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds the office is writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recep@@ tive capacity for families with minor children in Italy significantly increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) consider these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU @-@ states also would send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spi@@ der political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children threaten due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful reception conditions and a haz@@ ard to child health . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold the interest rates to 0,@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations have decreased over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for a raise .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , whereby inflation is expected to rise in the autumn by almost 3 % .
but it sign@@ aled that in the coming years interest rates would be necessary to breed the inflation led by the Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may possibly rise more than expected to rise in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economy , which was published one year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time to finance the finance plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the upcoming February , although it is expected now that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC remains weak ( GDP ) at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain beam of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be needed than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forecast currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year .
it has maintained its growth forecast on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages relative to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth numbers exceeded the rising expectations of a zinc raise , which GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.3 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be slightly more rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and low @-@ level salary , as the tigh@@ tening will first get worse before it becomes better .
she added that monetary policy in the coming years can not prevent the income from the previous years , but she added that wages will recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound is attri@@ but@@ able to what a portion of lower consumption spending is compensated .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote that caused the sin@@ king of damage .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will reach prices and economy .
before the final verdict of the bank to the interest rates , the call was increased to a zinc raise , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressing households , with three political decision makers in July require a rise to 0.5 % .
the inflation was dropped last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the exceeding in proportion to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent set@@ backs of the S@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders would go to shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those with which the existing de@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is alleged to pres@@ cribe 10,000 @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; HIV prevention treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September after a fight against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ constitutional preventive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can decrease the risk of infection in high risk prevention by approximately 86 percent , now supplied by health service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice last year after the N@@ HS had authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the report announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England @-@ Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) .
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the UK in April 2018 .
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that will be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced the HIV transmission in infection @-@ endangered types .
Pr@@ i ahead of intercourse meaning that just enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before the intercourse .
to those who come for treatment in question are sw@@ ule or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated .
clinics are identified in clinics that agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status does not have to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will report £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected and implemented in large scale as it is implemented in large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and transfer the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce HIV prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing advancement in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is rapidly performed throughout the country and that no one has left a risk to HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Ministry of Finance , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to the government after months of delays and hesit@@ ant implementation .
the evidence show how transforms this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the EP &apos;s advantages .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to end the proliferation of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack their bags and sold their bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square meters has been completely obsol@@ ete .
originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ y layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that had 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms across each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the announcement .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked up to each other without forced us to fill up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for the fan of placing two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine there is a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Ligh@@ ting put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ r@@ ored units for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a y@@ ar@@ ky door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so it is when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , one additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials which give space to the space of its luxury advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that will help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not miss you into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly default in something quite intimate .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars of property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in an argument due to one of the largest property industry Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business for 2014 , but a sharp confrontation on the separation finds in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna the brothers spent 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans set up and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis contains now offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her died father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s performance and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one court states that this means that Col@@ in property has the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the design of real estate and cash has proved itself to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held last Friday .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but poses Paul before , to manage some domini@@ ons in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; wrote . &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought milk bars and delic@@ acy of Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; high school &quot; in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped their property to pass on to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brethren land to land , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis @-@ group , where Col@@ in claimed that Mark had been paid to $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , though he was a former AF@@ L board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in rep@@ lied with SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul decided to res@@ sing me and to draw our family names through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want , that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
out of new staff chief is planning to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more ev@@ enly course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of the White House , at his first working day at his first working day , he was a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information given into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the employees that information should flow via him - whether on paper or in brie@@ fing - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ dump Tr@@ ump by monitoring their media .
President Tr@@ umps on television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ isions is still strong .
&quot; if a Candi@@ date was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February to poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter custom ever was &quot; under control &quot; was ridiculous .
perhaps those fighting bodies know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets could contain even more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his employees have made it some times to keep away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently preventing it , that Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es prot@@ ru@@ des .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house which composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by encouraging Tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons not to blame .
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ makers :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press sections , above all those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he ex@@ cre@@ ed out where these come from .
exactly this happened in late February , when someone gave the president mal@@ evol@@ ent a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was rel@@ eg@@ ated because of ra@@ ges , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ makers added that the then staff Chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still trying to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ sought criminals get Post of Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hoped .
the police of all over Europe sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the requested heavy criminal off@@ ences are not known , evidence from the population will gain and pray .
Euro@@ pol re@@ reported on Friday from the action that on the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; calendar of winter follows .
the experiences have shown that many distr@@ ust hide their destination , it was called Euro@@ pol .
one submitted 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online @-@ ges@@ tures have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them based on information according to the publication on the website .
traveler negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travelers on war fu@@ eling that have negotiated one from the municipality , to rec@@ laim a field in front of their men &apos;s homes .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; million@@ aires . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they have only been thrown out in May without being de@@ ported from one of the Council to prevent atrocities in order to prevent their accidents .
the tactical group found a gap in the defensive systems and op@@ pressing their cars by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are on Monday night there , after they were forwar@@ ded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones into the pas@@ sers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by holding long under@@ instructions to protect its parks .
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mons up when the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a community who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of this travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
an spokes@@ woman in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are consciously aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to proceed as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many inhabitants as many inhabitants sign an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we will present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ance factory company mbH to 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the number of refugees rising in the country , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which was concerned for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of a development plan in order to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the church at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and at that time he spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with manager Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star luxury category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
you can welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof always stood before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were swe@@ pt out , blankets to the part built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is really a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes cas@@ hier .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to set up broad , explains the worse .
both individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led so sc@@ iss@@ ors .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to decide exactly exactly .
under a million Euro , he reck@@ ons .
also the outdoor facilities are brought to front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special announces Grand Jury
in the Russia affair , by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Com@@ bu@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
in recent weeks the panel has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the cause of familiar persons .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller is extended and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N transm@@ itter , there &apos;s already the first dischar@@ ges of the Gre@@ et in connection with a meeting between Com@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence services have been using the Krem@@ lin for a longer period to have a target in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were talks between the Com@@ umps Elec@@ tive team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Tr@@ ump came to the center in person and seek the accus@@ ation whether the president may not impe@@ ded the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main function of Grand j@@ uries is to check and decide on this evidence in possible shortcomings and to decide whether charges are charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called Acqu@@ itted Cham@@ bers .
mostly they are switched on when it concerns larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to re@@ charge individuals under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station CN@@ N were already exhibited pre @-@ lad@@ ders that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to a statement called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also , Tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ iger election campaigns Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the condition show that Mu@@ eller would not be afraid in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will turn on in the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the submission of the Gre@@ et is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to speak about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special tionist T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he doesn &apos;t know anything about the replacement of a Grand Jury .
however , this work also usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advocate any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to pres@@ cribe that something was changed to it , it says in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this b@@ umps , accus@@ ations had become loud against Tr@@ ump , he refused to impe@@ de the judiciary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump signed it for an adjustment of the investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
after representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special conductors and its employees .
the del@@ est spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was dis@@ missed .
unlike an independent special event of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , about the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired at the President of the Federal Ministry of Justice in theoretically .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ ns on Thursday , after which the special shareholders could not be released so easily .
Antarc@@ tica : giant ice@@ berg is driving in the Antarc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic Arctic has solved a gigantic ice@@ berg of the narro@@ w@@ ly size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
the one tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big col@@ li@@ ds are now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and width of up to 50 km , it is one of the largest ice @-@ min@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ice@@ berg , is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ov@@ a@@ ze in the region for about 30 years , the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ eted background .
according to many researchers , that can be related to heating .
the now un@@ broken tro@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the peak of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this swe@@ ep was the balance of wax and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was crum@@ bled there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the fore I have never withdrawn as far as presently .
in addition , the ice plate is at tension and could dis@@ integrate , if there is a key point out of dro@@ p@@ out .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it removes on the water and removes the ice so much water as it yields after the merge itself .
however , the loss of the fe@@ ather leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth largest fe@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tica .
from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he confirmed he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will be able to grow again , or in the long run , and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers don &apos;t withdraw the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg not on climate change , however , in the past few decades many ic@@ sen@@ es of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula can be crum@@ bled .
this long period of the Antarc@@ tica extends to South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey is the ice @-@ surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula since the 195@@ 0er years decreased by 28 000 square kilometers .
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has risen in the past 50 years by around three degrees and t@@ amed to the areas where the temperature is the fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants home star@@ if at the personnel
because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free working spots , the CD@@ U calls out of the employer association to become more attractive .
it was just before the summer break the cre@@ ist@@ ag showed 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees got their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were available for the places this year .
nevertheless , the group lacks staff to manage the raised requirements and tasks .
currently , in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G to take the initiative and confront the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work on the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for specialists , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented of the application cr@@ app@@ ings , it is said .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself from inside and outside , indicating concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an apprentic@@ eship offensive , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
this already ends itself after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related causes out of the ministry comes out .
to take the highest time to action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ te , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond his party to the common request .
he had long already been in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a worth@@ less surprise when he asked the recruitment of personnel in question and the rest of the parties were ast@@ ounding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed that enable an exit from the municipal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not able to get a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county government should seek cooperation with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the municipalities of the cities - including a bon@@ star@@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better its employees and officials when it envis@@ ages the collective bar@@ gaining for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , ero@@ oms or more money there are only when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new spaces had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tor Martin judge have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy cuts the tone to NGO migrants @-@ Bo@@ at@@ ebo@@ at
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has added NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can go forward , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ing warning came a day after the Italian authorities de@@ ported a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ t &apos; , because their team had worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which is in operation only since one year , declined to express themselves on detailed supervis@@ es of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we are unable to operate in the search and rescue services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had been the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ t &apos; , the Iu@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is believed that its crew take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that smug@@ glers can go down , so that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting was allegedly found just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the sect of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected , controlled by the authority of the Italian coastal defence , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not supervised from any other motiv@@ ations .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iu@@ v@@ enta mainly need an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ e@@ Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable because they wouldn &apos;t get any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates @-@ Organisation doctors are without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants , who arrived in Italy after b@@ ail@@ out in Italy , has declined in recent weeks , sug@@ gesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with the local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judges &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizenship in this month about economic development initiatives and with Che@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
nine past@@ ler@@ y bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two speakers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michael &apos;s chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the prevailing planes .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ but@@ t rewards .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the popular throw market .
again he established a lookout spot , connected by &quot; fled &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate attack .
in the last two days many altitude metres were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and showers were welcomed breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers were cur@@ able in the Shim@@ u@@ ft@@ able Sole .
also Neu@@ stadt has been ten@@ dered .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and nearly 4@@ 500 metres , the group had spot@@ ted the Pf@@ alz Forest on its best side - sporty and culturally .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being we@@ ather@@ ed with wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , million fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages including .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ des who are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and the last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to offer a whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on these trains still several clubs rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the upcoming weekend will organize the soccer world association FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven quali@@ fies .
even Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen also advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must concern itself in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old people , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be much more often present on these markets than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports also , le@@ agues , in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian countries , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly unusual .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ats has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress @-@ reactions , hormonal changes .
additionally , there need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response .
professional Gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the l@@ itte players is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard through online games , and in the scene , the structures of the classic sports .
the scientists are considering the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , since there are no intercultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active amuse@@ ment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , there were 50 million euros implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
sales are expected to be at 130 million in three years .
against the under 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey away , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot of things in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ y .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
just fall into nostal@@ gia , and the old times dis@@ missed , is no longer sufficient today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; said likewise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not stick to it that only at football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy has condemned to suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced in June because of the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy did on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she had been confronted with a penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives ar@@ ded that both she and Mr Roy has been working on a psychological disease .
dressed in red pants and a cre@@ amy bl@@ ouse , Carter was with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions made Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; he said the prosec@@ utor to the court .
&quot; it ended its life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has not assumed responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any repent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters was a lawyer , it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which it is completely regre@@ tt@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was no day that I was not griev@@ ing the loss of my beloved Son .
I want he to be proud of me and how I go with everything I am going to . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be followed by knowledge , &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this only person with which I was together every day since my birth is a pain that I am always keeping with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , making it a crime to challenge another , suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon mon@@ tory poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after comm@@ uter texts revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging yourself on , Spring of a building , er@@ stand yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent to her death in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought to pay attention through the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that it sol@@ ves through some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in 2007 by murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Tree : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed me to run at the Audi Cup as captain is no accident .
the FC Bayern Trust the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season to - extra motivation was da@@ zz@@ led there .
anything else was different in his place in the cabin , that was seeing Joshua immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself the divided bin@@ der to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first bet as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one was better able to run than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen by teenagers , deb@@ tors and especially from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a chec@@ ker chosen but he .
sugar be@@ g you distribute the most ende@@ aring up to those who wants to hold a lot that one wants to keep in mind .
if so , who was chosen to compete the legacy of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation may use only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right back , this is his position , the white bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all k@@ im@@ ed me in this run@@ way as the one who can take the helm also best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated troops .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal therewith to re@@ play its lack of fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches then to tie the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus no negative to drop in their first appearance in Bavaria .
the after all the folding is quite good .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the rif@@ le , both besie@@ ged sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was frequently tough , in addition , they tried even in the game building a few times successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy proved that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ used this Bavaria world is still available for the new acc@@ esses , one saw in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave no one or two interviews , but determines six or seven interviews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ ant said goodbye after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of South le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with rh@@ initi@@ land @-@ pe@@ el@@ ic Minister : economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ ej@@ le
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the economic ministries of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new econom@@ ist Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and op@@ ting the old secretary at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ dom attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest of the turn@@ around provides Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito connection between the highway 1 between Kel@@ ley and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country .
again this year the ministry hopes for a plan of planning , up to 2021 the building should be right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the wes@@ tr@@ ance Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need of the state of transport .
the aim is to take the distance in December 2020 in operation , says the Minister of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it as a sign for regional , but internationally competing firms .
the Chamber of Industry and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves for the development of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase the sales volumes in supermarkets , and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
moreover , I have an open ear for people who want to establish a company &apos;s own company , praise the HK .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent Master@@ examination and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ independent within ten years after the master@@ ing education .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time , it lacks the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Guide of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust shar@@ ks to the state of mobility so far only 29 places are occupied .
the BC@@ CI calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Audi@@ tors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receipt of provincial highways than suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
serious tre@@ mb@@ ling is also the previous broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note number 3.4 .
they are up@@ lifting Internet connections and bur@@ sts .
on the other hand , ex @-@ economic ministries in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months , due to in@@ consistency already the field has been cleared .
Audi is supposed to change 2@@ 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as a limited restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus based on European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the ventures as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the deployment of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that e@@ mit diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alisation of the exhau@@ st exhau@@ st exhau@@ st exhau@@ st exhau@@ st exhau@@ st can also take too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be accused of overcoming the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that should regulate emissions when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former manager of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations , after the authorities have accused of having a system installed to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation would be extremely difficult to strain : the luxury car manufacturer is superior to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los kno@@ bs and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the best published Carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also at 85 the Argent@@ inian @-@ chief is still playing and works on a film .
his message : laugh , because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he spoke among other things as an artist for luck - what was put to fru@@ ition .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris in the late 60s came the break : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artists of cities inspire over and over again and again .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is sitting at his own personal details , according to the character , works almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches can still find its dro@@ l@@ ent figures further spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most test@@ es animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ ght@@ lessness as a counter player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which is supposed to come to the Kin@@ ol screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he is focusing more on the TV series , which , like its original desig@@ nations , is being produced .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the detection of dro@@ ught @-@ causing conditions and due to the diseases @-@ borne insec@@ t , what scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great headaches are prepared .
Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years was exposed to climate change impacts which has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more in fall .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ it@@ ters , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very requested for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ e said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include better water distribution and slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of sorts , which are resistant to drying .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the gir@@ est R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this Saturday and Sunday with a medium @-@ age group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shop@@ pers , ig@@ sa@@ ws , traders , vag@@ ant or a country house should be able to experience these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt high officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug war .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about certainty .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what it feels safer : you should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plate on the front side of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal .
there are drug singers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resting break from the violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are s@@ worn , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to dec@@ aying his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are available at least seven dead in seven States this year .
among the latter , her editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be re@@ porter , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
its lack is felt deep , though its presence is everywhere present - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which is its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wearing t @-@ shirts , which will show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a probe was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , these were only introduced to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings that are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still persist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now yet di@@ zz@@ ling .
without information on the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why we mis@@ trust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez abandoned the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ v@@ th river . &quot;
the cap ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to freely fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ eling over the last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , because rival groups struggle to fill a vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of produced , two @-@ story ped@@ als for drug k@@ ens that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the debt has broken that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understandings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival cart@@ on parties in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they ship to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were persu@@ asi@@ ve that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without going to the smoking har@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time the paper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took place .
re@@ porter loved it to publish hard apt studies without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories who dar@@ ed to treat no one else .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them .
he gave voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must assume the task which will be assigned as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many troops ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spa @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ckers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table .
now she asked , was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death has also forced her to ask her own assumptions regarding how to get their job done best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ way , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , keep away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ story district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described the governor themselves as being un@@ trustworthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain scenery , where the drug ties stand in facto under control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has had three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known pit Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é about the government spending , focused on the hometown of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was provided when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally made by drug retailers and authorities .
a re@@ porter from public records , that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy , which ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently several pris@@ i govern@@ ors were accused due to high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months before had the reader seen the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers who protest against the mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ k Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ app@@ te a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of a further journalist to the Office of the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez were killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become more marked by organized in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was off in Washington and tried to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities to pronoun@@ ce journalists , and they can bring it , because they said the truth .
it has since then asked that it is divided by the government , because it is concerned that its rage has hurt its obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , were surrounded by government officials and an equally valid society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also by command of politicians and security guards held by organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published last year more than half of the attacks on journalists by the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you dis@@ miss the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ eta @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am due to my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones were beside their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border @-@ state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez lifted himself publicly on the drug @-@ cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted down , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who want to stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives to that drug trafficking scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors were sitting from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to h@@ um .
a series of sh@@ ale plants with band@@ ages and security guards in the vicinity of the swimming pool , Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
on the on @-@ board steel , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title site had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ats near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a view of the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they showed it not .
among the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also remember to close it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , on which Javier was assass@@ inated , the trainees me asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that their sli@@ pped skin from red@@ dish @-@ brown was - and they said it could have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; referred him as &quot; the best@@ owed rac@@ ed dinosau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered style of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ aters is the best preserved fossil l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he arrived at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , du@@ g .
he met something that was missing from the surrounding cliffs , and decided to see more accurately .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground level .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you flas@@ her just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is reflected in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa der dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters although it is covered with arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably by meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked by Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , named the Museum Techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the ast@@ ounding preservation of copies made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and arm@@ ors on his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ding , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ variation is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in today .
it points to that the dinosau@@ rs be@@ jagt the dinosau@@ r by enough pressure by flesh &apos;s dinosau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals , which apply the counter @-@ effects - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or rus@@ hing - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot , what sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ tion @-@ behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveals that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was rot@@ or .
scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including his consistent Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ r , when he died , driven into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea bottom .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern flour@@ ishing today , and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ co@@ ded skin skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and the original form of the beast is maintained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost the same way as in the early Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ time was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs down the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the arm@@ oured dinosau@@ rs of some of his fur@@ tive ancestors was hun@@ ted down .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ran@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been sun@@ k after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ dered in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , du@@ g .
according to the museum , it is the bes@@ ter@@ ned @-@ ar@@ ed dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ aters were we@@ dged by the western Canada , until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater order of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cl@@ utch ov@@ els along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geographic such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a winning in Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more it is conf@@ use .
pet@@ ri@@ fied mon@@ te of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy arm@@ or that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his righ@@ tist front is on his side , his five fingers are pointed out upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass @-@ kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , long @-@ term rod and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people have been wounded .
the first information from the police were between 17@@ 00@@ Uhr and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm just under 30 cars , among them probably also trucks .
at first the exact number of the injured was not valid at first .
it is about light to moderate severe injury , said a poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ acher .
a great deal of li@@ ve@@ ying on b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich a round of ten kilometres made of return .
as a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , there came also on the return train to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade wrote down the marks of the vehicle @-@ gl@@ ists who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock then another accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an auto@@ cr@@ ite and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment one has experienced almost everyone already : there is nothing that is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are plung@@ ed into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
does the creator come and w@@ akes up an impro@@ per or rip off the road in the middle of the work@@ flow .
check @-@ out check @-@ in control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tested the German @-@ card control .
it is simply confirmed by phone that you have taken its place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
there is currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then expected to be available in many other long @-@ distance rail routes in Germany in the beginning of next year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a rail spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the railway de@@ valuation with no guards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked a online ticket - what already most passengers do .
one also has to have bought it via the railways of the railways , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket reservation .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customer then a button is available for electronic recovery .
the traction guide get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located in the train and taken the booked seating area Y .
comes the train@@ ee manager at the card control in Place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already dec@@ e@@ ased online ticket .
so you can sleep further , keep on silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railways - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who relax@@ es without a ticket control through our train staff , check out in the DB navig@@ ator just ourselves .
this allows the guests to create their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives rail , knows that besides delays and pas@@ times the driver controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
because often , in any case one of the fellow travellers did not take all the documents to get to the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or your personal ID is missing or otherwise a document that you have to offer .
the consequence are endless discussions between train managers and passenger cars , which leads to poor atmosphere in the section or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the creative work at the end the time takes care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken until its core .
just a day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented them and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else had posted the information on their feed , closed her Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly being saved on their tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper of the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 olds who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live @-@ wee@@ ten live .
he took a picture of Brow@@ n@@ ly blo@@ ous body that was out@@ stretched on the road and staying there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought of fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone later in order to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ n@@ father to be a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live @-@ feed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another poli@@ cem@@ an is his gun and crying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Sarah reminded itself of its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we are able to call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sh@@ ook .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consist of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand the answers .
as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , which took a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that took it countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; it reminded itself of what she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they have to know and it must be seen and raised in it .
it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experienced a cl@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ area when activists killed on the possible non @-@ charge by officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
in there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them on demonstrators .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her camera ann Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to be &quot; documented , &quot; what happened .
a question came to a question of Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of white men in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and grew up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , have not cent@@ red up their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that this is the movement &quot; not about a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most apparent participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as they mar@@ ries in love and mar@@ ries their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the distor@@ tion of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives of lives .
two of the three founders of the movement , which had shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Martin in 2012 , identified as a sul@@ try .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women must carry the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the skill because of its identity as the heart of the film has been selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was on the front front , because in a life on these crosses as a black , sul@@ try woman is so much at stake .
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras were gone out in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area which she called her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless it sounds on a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ ad@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is still far from being built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ east of the pedestrian prec@@ inct , since the first presentation in 2009 the population is prop@@ elled in supporters and opponents .
cold the theme hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; popular and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say to the bit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ al@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advocates extends that a gallery draws more customers into town , of which also the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm market hall stands , in which 13 direct market will market its products .
at the beginning of construction work will be concluded .
the Galerie M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and at the Be@@ da square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farm market hall .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to have a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct market will market in a market hall in the Galerie arrives at the level of the rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should not be too low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , d@@ wind@@ - or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores will be empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is even more important that we at least maintain the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly from the manufacturer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly reasonably priced .
as you can see , shop shops are located at a shopping centre just by major companies , because the dor@@ sal rents are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , special transactions are almost no more and that which is still remaining , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming out .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , to exp@@ el all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply will not work .
and a shopping centre , which is empty , also no one needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market , it &apos;s thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I think - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farm market is broken up , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cut @-@ offs from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ zer was assigned a 35 @-@ year sentence after they publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A becoming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching similarity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline uni@@ fies its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and a pioneering doctoral researcher , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorithms analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as anyone with this genom@@ ic data - the many mod@@ alities as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ al determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been openly condemned since her pu@@ ber@@ ty about identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , Computer Wor@@ lds and theft .
through the prison its image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white r@@ f@@ ie , in which man@@ ing is visi@@ bly weighing on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde Per@@ cent@@ ed - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist portraits of strangers made out of for@@ ens@@ ical arti@@ facts like cigarette lighter and che@@ wing g@@ um , adding the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look like .
that was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper mag@@ azin .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so make contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her de@@ tain@@ ees M@@ use were re@@ mixed to un@@ similar letters that have been ex@@ chan@@ ges@@ ted several years over the course of two years .
they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o @-@ illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; suppor@@ ter images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ation was able to convert and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was calling for seven brutal years after seven brutal war in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of bl@@ iss@@ ful coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some low@@ land and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump will lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et distances to the rigid divisions , which he should actually fix , continue to infl@@ ame .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its superior signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ ochon@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pen@@ cil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in biological regard , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA @-@ data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic no@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a fre@@ eb@@ ir@@ el@@ ef@@ on in his hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ability of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have got your speech cold , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came right from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted them from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am still getting goo@@ se@@ b@@ umps when I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - like it was pres@@ ci@@ ent in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulations which collap@@ ses like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pen@@ cil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that deals with Chelsea , like the movement , which were also hidden behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford for kill@@ ings
a nationwide citizen hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been sought in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly violations .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ unch ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) on the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , on the occasion of her alleged involvement on the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the A@@ ging of the Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several bul@@ lets died .
one by the police authority of Chicago released a non @-@ governmental warning system that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was yet explained in the place of action for dead , and de@@ ek@@ tive investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , we said officials .
La@@ them@@ self has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ unch was now out of absence and excluded from the subject to the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue that is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigations into any manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he calls upon the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ led tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ unch and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the roadmap @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian vi@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the driver , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list however notes that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of by the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren public@@ ally promoted by public @-@ funded dop@@ ing in the Russian sport .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our Anti @-@ D@@ oping system was granted a bug .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ kos words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
talking to the Russian selling point R@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has before to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing scandal , out of the carrying out of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved in the right direction , to be used again .

by creating and licensing the software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it allows companies to conduct surveys , specifications and demographic groups to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools for companies is used to measure employees .
Er@@ re@@ tt said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap pol@@ ls and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low supply results - so that you can drill to why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have to be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ings , in which those who have spoken , were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance @-@ sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , after the budget@@ ary technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and realize bad behavior , saw an rising interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , enables Conver@@ cent company tailored &quot; Pul@@ - &quot; surveys , lets you collect sensitive answers in real time and see the warmth of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employees to report a bad behavior .
and if the main business is involved , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of public opinion has seized the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff treated badly or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers escape fluctu@@ ation and cl@@ ashes , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has been used conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously hidden from executives , which were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ loud internship , identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree vision into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen interrupted for ethical bre@@ aches of the En@@ ron scandal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and charge the company with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both supports start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing for companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised all capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers agreed to $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought the entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just bets .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that pays off their voices , and that the work that you are doing , then feel more strongly obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors get ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies are well running . companies run well if employees are committed and involved .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data is useless if the administrator did not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes are on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can breed .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen himself too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you are not following , employees will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really listened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and if you do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys now , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ating employees it was through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high rates .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood .
a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint is talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team at the campus .
some have drawn up their tri@@ cot@@ ting parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these two minutes will represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed themselves to the summer courses are returning to their final test , before returning next morning at 6 : 30 to the water man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ach @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was closed .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training session of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise took away from the two days is more than a day when the brood at the beginning of the camp moved almost a week after the last season and during the Summer School for the first time during Mor@@ as &apos;s six seasons in West wood exercises .
they should keep 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 prior to the formal play@@ grounds for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the control change of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy itiner@@ aries of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden for three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it pressed , they plac@@ ent further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , which is placed in view of the clear sight of its fields from a adjacent parking area and the bor@@ dering Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which is already wor@@ shipped with foot@@ b@@ ables , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ step , no easy task .
breaking players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will employ our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adapt to it .
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of one exercise , it is quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ feit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with counter@@ reports to billing audi@@ tors by third parties , and then show their results under the original contract , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible mis@@ reports and to send them to billing audi@@ tors , which may display results from the billing examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of them believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were over@@ flooded in the wake of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if it did not manage to eliminate h@@ ash@@ less mail@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate Declaration on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fact covered by third parties are challenged , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Produc@@ man@@ ag@@ ar for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will still be able to test his feature to the &quot; connected article &quot; and works on other changes in his news @-@ feed to l@@ essen false messages .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video , and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and in 1980 @-@ he years a lo@@ op@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he we@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sc@@ anned the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he un@@ expec@@ tedly found .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , who was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell to smoke ; for then one lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell will have an effect as if he was himself also .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen my welcome du@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) it all too beautiful to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounting break@@ ans at the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ es , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access in 2006 as the last encounter , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when induced a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , take it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards who possessed what possessed : &quot; you could think that land @-@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bul@@ ke to have fought two families .
guys , leave everything going to go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader basis into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a turmoil that appeared 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Run@@ ning of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rhodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers arose in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons who hid the family Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed from the 18th century by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be virtually Ga@@ ther@@ er , always make debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solve their debt crisis by getting rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of good guys to advertise with a talent to lobby . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about Ecuador , the terrain of a san@@ ship from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle eng@@ ul@@ fed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unvei@@ ling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started the launch of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz to hold the logo and the slogan ge@@ heim .
by the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) does not really think , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we are convinced that we as a bathroom of Hon@@ our citizens know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action I go to more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able single occasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is standing in the competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef will be able to cost its new roof brand and the campaign in Bad Honnef .
military reforms in Turkey - earth@@ go@@ ose fear of the army
every year in early August , he advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ers and officials in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
at the presidency of the Heads of Government now also the five vi@@ vi@@ re@@ mi@@ er as well as the ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs .
these were civilians in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government moves the re@@ ins to the military .
Chief of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were canc@@ eled .
since the failed cou@@ p , President Erdogan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile House Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdogan as a wire drawing of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , it will be negotiated in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day after the coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdogan the ren@@ dition as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really really control the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ vei@@ ls in the military @-@ headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general rule , there are concerns due to an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the head office for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the major rein@@ car@@ ess of the army and the security guards goes on at any rate .
in the middle of July Erdogan by decre@@ e a further 73@@ 95 coup , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
yet it seemed that Erdogan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times , they em@@ itted their role as gu@@ ardian of the secular state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory , Erdogan rejected the power of the military step by step , not least in calling on the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say Erdogan is targe@@ ting a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a non @-@ mentioned officers who searched for asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
meets this , such a development could not leave Nato .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance following the aci@@ dity for the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for visa @-@ oriented working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty which will increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do so by changing the US the way people from other countries green cards will be spent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates that have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge which our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by American media .
Ministry is going to tour track for racing boards
over the past few months the future of the racing must have been fought - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ sh circuit is to be built on which the tourist train de@@ parts .
in order to secure the future of the racing ship in the long term , according to the transport of the transport sector , the road shall be starting at the circuit in the long run .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the route of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ race tracks , the country knows itself especially important for tourism , &quot; stated Verkehrs@@ Secretary General Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track is approximately 2.5 million Euros .
from this sum , the country is over 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country , will currently finally be voted , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ College as operators are already agre@@ eing about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the roadmap , which used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway association will be closed for a period of eleven years .
in order that the race @-@ sti@@ ff @-@ Shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the race seat is one of the most popular railway connection between the Il@@ men@@ au railway stations and race tracks .
in the course of a pilot plant in the past few months , the track has been utilized by sufficient many people to order it again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ lown .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ted professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ids of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ps have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a silic@@ on skin that feels warm to the touch - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions , &quot; and choosing things from the colour of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ps have developed to robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that they find appealing as for example sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the site of True &quot; sp@@ y .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sal feminine properties that goes to play upon rape if you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah is , be@@ zz@@ ly a most .
on his website per@@ ched True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toys .
their formation and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .
most men will naturally not keep any sex robot , and while the FR@@ R re@@ alises their increasing popularity , they still remain prevalent at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ated out of the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
there is still some over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened with , in which the White House gives a president who have ge@@ ars women sexually attacked .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the ru@@ ined body and the out@@ spoken eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their pe@@ as want them to feel humane , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated or simply go away from their companion .
they have no placement or background history , nothing that could be seen on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
in other words : they are fake slaves .
or to put it in the speech of 2017 : service maid
jumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a t@@ amp@@ ly of the dump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest thought , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tick @-@ elected relatives .
we are all supposedly approached to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
have noticed less has been the power to bring families together .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a centre @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visits me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar at the same side .
to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks to them .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump but the power @-@ reaching effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gross@@ est possibility that we will no longer meet his / her / her messages .
but there is still a frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison with its standards suddenly as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasonable .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ian version of the ma@@ d@@ w , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate to re@@ public@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ hes of the New York parking section , and the top three dollars that you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate @-@ changing music gives this a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go to it and have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one has asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass on my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to deposit the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also exercises pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store exc@@ used exc@@ usable , while I had tired of the experience to submit their credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us has moved to the hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ o@@ us was condemned because of murder after a appeal by prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first stroke .
he k@@ ills ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by comm@@ itting them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pist@@ o@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der who hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , by which they say they be sighted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; National Criminal Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it will raise the objection upon the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer to find a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ er schools , the quadru@@ pe@@ ers from F@@ ishing and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the continuing schools .
three of the students go to the grammar school in the future , four to the real school .
Schul@@ le@@ å Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representative of the public in the House of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol for the school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , a young eagle , who grow up in the chicken yard , but then dis@@ missed the freedom .
in addition , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and took it from his h@@ ens .
instead of a hen , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make of him a chicken sm@@ ote , the eag@@ les spread out on a high mountain its wings and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the classification of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young p@@ ses , the cylinder bore to the w@@ ager .
the Eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ le@@ amm@@ ar Sit@@ te .
although the young was different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , they belong to that .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ asti@@ ty that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed the acceptance of the colleagues , the former deb@@ tors Michael Müller , who again and again jump into sub@@ po@@ is@@ ers , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , the class@@ mates explained Sophia Schumacher .
she let her students leave classes for two years only because it was a really great time .
after all , they can rely on the quadru@@ pe@@ ers .
to finish the end , all students left a song of summer @-@ time and vacation time .
it was great pleasure in the children .
for the new school year eight candidates have already registered .
two Bul@@ gars arrested for illegal camping in Greece

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly is the software update taking place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the Diesel @-@ Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars were offered .
you should improve the exhau@@ st behavior of cars of the total emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE car Club Europe is invaluable :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory update of these updates are only valid for the vehicles , the che@@ ers software , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the power@@ train @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a considerable implementation in the coming months , but has not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if an inspection is due in any case , this will be done within the framework .
how long should the cra@@ fting in total go ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the depend on the part of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not want to drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE reveals to the wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would apply , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive prize of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the Ace fears this .
but just in the regions where driving har@@ b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas there is so far no value loss for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to be seen with a sale yet .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is regarded as the first R@@ apper , one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cul@@ tu@@ tion was announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the choreo@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .

traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will arrange a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the Le@@ ar @-@ series announced with progressive TV @-@ series , and therefore already announced on taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them the means - and that deb@@ ited me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker is the master of Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he taught in the press conference .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , marv@@ elled that so far no application has to give the application profile .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next time .
thus , in consideration of the regular notice period - there shall be enough time for a review .
as Has@@ lach for the administrative community as a sub@@ e construction authority , the applicant must show corresponding accounts .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would it no longer be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to go for advice up to Off@@ enburg .
but civil @-@ proximity was the city and itself important , says W@@ acker , who reported from a good working climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in office more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated while the W@@ acker can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even in the future varied projects stand on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and the Low @-@ car park are accessible .
the kin@@ ties bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium is still subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter is about to beat some 1.5 million euros with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks wait for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gest@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is of great scope for a city @-@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gardening , it can be quite flexible and respon@@ ds to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green systems is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for it , what is fit , &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the schei@@ ff Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
in any case the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything works here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of work : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( freezing ) has been for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains a long time , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good business climate but also for the further development of the city .
anyone who wants to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker should be interested in more information about the city of Has@@ lach and Bachelor &apos;s studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction projects .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ bles are high @-@ quality and low @-@ construction , construction planning , administration , administration of municipal loung@@ es , municipal courts with building yard and urban ten@@ derness as well as under@@ e construction authority including memorial protection .
bike on wir@@ es : south @-@ line closed
the police had previously unknown the blue bike from the railway track in the field of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and look for the night hours after them .
close to the scene were witnessed a pink Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator had brought himself into a great danger , and also endangered the train traffic .
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant as well as the delay and the cost of rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ als of the railways could also return to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in total , be out by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south@@ ward route could be managed without disability .
nearly 10 persons of people were Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the distance of distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains were not falling but they were delayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ ech Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 metres high .
ins@@ ulators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the UK more than 300@@ ,000 , caused ga@@ stri@@ fe and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the person usually got advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins have contributed to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to make sure that damaging micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body , do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are capable of em@@ ulate inflammation , are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ ologic cell on mice is found , that a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the elements of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - who is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system is also inf@@ ested with people .
the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan analysed a kind of immune cell that the tolerance fo@@ sters , when it found that a group of studies had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which , however , had not been separated .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ organisms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the wor@@ ms of mice have been sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .
mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ful environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not produce this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria out on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerant du@@ ci@@ ve cells .
when the active component from the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han on the feed of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant du@@ ci@@ ve cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i can protect in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in men as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells do inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ s can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is a &quot; genius &quot;

Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers via the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted into the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new low@@ back for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , looked at present democratic presidents in front of elections with a certain concern after Berlin .
only a stur@@ fire from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the federal government - this was the most important wish for the campaign .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed radically .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , not even described in the approach .
there were frozen .
and indeed one by one .
the German @-@ CD@@ U , after the surprisingly end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising question of fac@@ tions from a Green MEP has plung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the landing @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal executive guide Michael Kellner has requested the ab@@ out@@ spoken Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ anya to return their mandate .
the trans@@ ference to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the constitu@@ ent .
El@@ ke T@@ ests must go back its mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal executive guide and election @-@ fle@@ ites of the Gre@@ ens on the Red@@ Respon@@ siveness Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD election fighter , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ obs@@ bot@@ s reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ sions began with the unexpected defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades .
after the elections of the Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia everything will be different .
this was then also - and it was all clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the bar@@ ber , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te hau@@ te .
the comrades lined up in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD national chief , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did pretty much wrong in crisis communication , then what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now , even Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister has already been critic@@ ised for a longer period of time .
mi@@ ese survey values came .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , Wei@@ l was getting stronger in recent weeks to put an acc@@ ent in the federal acc@@ ents .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not hidden from Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him because they promised themselves to stabili@@ ze the party in themselves .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l on the party &apos;s internal compul@@ sion is not at fault any fault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz already at all .
in times , the comrades are striving to hold the own ranks .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the ab@@ id@@ able parliament@@ arians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ anya presents their own career interests through the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS T@@ anya is not elected for her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on MP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ained about a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the German @-@ Sax@@ on SPD to the German Bundestag to the R@@ ND .
&quot; now the personal career calls for a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians the Wah@@ ler@@ result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further .
he called for clarification of the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there was further promises of the CD@@ U precip@@ itation .
convey@@ ors for Or@@ ders III
those who want to be home in the years can get support from the country soon .
informed by the Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler was once again showing a review of the previously mentioned events .
since 1991 it has been in delicate recovery areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has still taken over two thirds of the funding assets .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not just opening up new areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the President of the President in Karlsruhe on April 4 that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the total amount of 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which were 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community received .
what is the result of a refurb@@ ishment ?
one shall further investigate the Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area ever cre@@ pt up , to san@@ e .
if necessary , the territory limits could then also be postponed .
the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday night Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme , where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the revit@@ alisation of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per property .
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally set as stat@@ ute .
the conversion period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 or 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would only once again be conducted , within the framework of those involved in the re@@ development area involved a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December it is said to be possible to proceed as soon as possible , in order to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commune must carry the vor@@ ab tests .
it is about evaluating the urban planning for abnormalities and decide when it is sanc@@ tioned and to what extent .
it will then also be included in the book for the particular property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again to received and get a picture of the situation promised them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ a stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and real estate agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which things are among other things about the structural condition and recovery views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget@@ ary and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can be made information about the size , division and residents of an apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that an exclusive questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
also new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding is based on the &quot; wind @-@ dog ration@@ ale &quot; who first comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no funding for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ tsk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors yourselves setting a micro@@ chip in order to get into the house and car with a hand movement
a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip , so that he can open his door to his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory role in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant method is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ pl@@ ated micro@@ chi@@ pped and only takes 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and for his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ payers of thousands .
the White House , a naval helicop@@ ters to the South La@@ wn for an event that won the American production last month , tax@@ payers would cost to the information of the military , which have been left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a round@@ trip through products from all over 50 countries .
the helicopter @-@ helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi .
the White House of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in an fragile order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy margin for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter started on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House would be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would need for the flight back .
the original flight fee was during the event at the helicopter , while the personnel &apos;s personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by T@@ IME on the basis of the T@@ IME , it was not clear whether the final flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ made , state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of health reform that was ongoing in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ tainment the government rules .
the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for travel .
but your use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the presidential flight operated in front of the background of his first campaign @-@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements informing about the use of the presidential jet of his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries shows , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew took frequently training trips around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to set off the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when Tr@@ ump in early July was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included in the training needs of the flight fee for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to put the helicopter in the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ ge@@ es for the presidential trips , and it is difficult to find the exact cost of the event .
according to boo@@ ths of the U.S. Secretary of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D expenditure for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
footage of the unit records the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ing that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter must lie far at this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ payers are based on estimates based on estimates for the approval rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds for DO@@ D do not contain personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contractual agreements .
at this time , the former press review of the White House , Sean Sp@@ icer defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ reads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether it inter@@ cept a b@@ ump with the helicopter , when he entered its round@@ trip over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fire@@ man .
the White House spoke Tr@@ ump to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and Ash@@ er@@ ahs with the media through its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
leaders of the second tennis Bundesliga are competing in the Su@@ chs@@ ess Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ We@@ iss Ne@@ uss will meet tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ le@@ end@@ ow@@ s@@ ander S@@ V .
in spite of the five games still pr@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leaders of the second tennis Bundesliga got the sense of reality for reality .
Team@@ leaders Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for his opponents at any rate .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays a quite similar formation .
especially at the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , they mainly provide imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ aying and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ sex@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will always be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is practically approaching .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ im four .
the moment , at the moment , the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not generate at the Bundesliga game , coming to the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c play@@ w@@ k Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ sealed ch@@ il@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski in the ball tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owes , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could also move again into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Juni@@ ors @-@ World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , no one fills the cad@@ res for Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res .
how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he put his signature under the law to bol@@ ting the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste , the law en@@ acted , &quot; the Congress made a few &quot; constitutional requirements . &quot; he added .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sho@@ ots against the US .
after all , the draft is expected to pun@@ ish European businesses that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors are supported by the domestic O@@ MV in accordance with other European companies , which are co @-@ financed with other European firms the construction of the Russian East Over@@ haul Nord Stream 2 .
the dru@@ g@@ cr@@ acks is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring about the sanctions even per executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hate him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fo@@ cos rel@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i C@@ art@@ el is moved to the center in the heat @-@ series of Net@@ fli@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received her first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ fathers , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 @-@ Company &quot; only with more state appointments and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) command the Mexican connection , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e R@@ az@@ ote ) in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal is returning as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ ves@@ tre , Kerry Bis@@ ses and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1 .
role backwards : the city provides 46 supplies
the city organised the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ table again .
with strong points of contact for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gartens the clock will be revers@@ ed .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply chain in the urban child care institutions ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy chief of the youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this job and delivers fresh cooked cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the county area of 46 children &apos;s day@@ care , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch time .
last year @-@ year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer also applies to the 35 @-@ hour support , if children remain until 14 pm . &quot;
46 sub @-@ time staff from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the landscap@@ ed dishes , they supplement the salad , raw foods and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , make food out , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ groups as well as seventh equipment - decide on the timetable .
&quot; the g@@ hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the Kit@@ chens to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection between the kitchen and the team is useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out into the cost between equity and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is said from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub@@ time employees will be reset .
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the education area not as strong as the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be infected with the elections in the provinces . three women de@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women can not be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban released threats against a choice process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
this year the elections will be handed over to power peacefully by a democratically elected government for the first time .
Hay@@ ce said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered of a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

GM@@ B concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to contribute to the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company failed to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products have Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said that over the past few years he invested more than 5 million pounds .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the shop of the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that the financing for modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ organizer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have been working here and the labor force focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing form of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person on Pla@@ ins said : &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross has only received a letter of GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will directly respond to it as we estimate the continuous engagement of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with employees that we work like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business constantly re@@ viewing - and that applies to all our business segments and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross country , in particular in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ us@@ as a production site . we should change our business processes at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not count in its pursuit of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after it has given a £ 18@@ 9 million to resolve its free@@ wheel clause , but have they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world war ?
the sensational approach has been hal@@ ted the trans@@ fer@@ window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world ord for more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will be the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional athlete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board consists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world three years ago from the PS@@ G President warned of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the top players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish club has expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy not to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

during the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders has thrown one in the Königs@@ felder street in front of the estate number 30 pic@@ tured sco@@ oter and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle for more than 200 euros .

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is seeking to witness the police .
because he arrived a car on his driving track , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ched the p@@ unch .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the district of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he came to him on his driving track so that he had to do@@ dge to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an drivers tou@@ ts the Leit@@ ke .
on the car there was kind of atomic damage .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident .
it may be good after the accident that the Merc@@ e@@ des@@ ist had not noticed the accident at all .

&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Prince Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one likes to go on to the church and this is a found Fres@@ sen &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse cases , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also emerged .
totally wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger den Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; My brother of Pope ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the clarification of a lawyer in Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domin@@ als sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is possible to record that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. have been applied in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accus@@ ations , many victims are underestimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even associate positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was relie@@ ved of his opinion .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; alleg@@ ations of violence of violence against protection of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to a lift , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , who was prepared for the beginning of the oil , if a domin@@ ican performed musically no top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all .
he is particularly dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of the medi@@ terranean or bro@@ therhood during the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also , the violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool began to occur outside of its impact .
it is not possible for him to find out of it too late or have taken the first hint to be taken seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cathedral @-@ horse school , on which he appeared , was perceived by practically all respondents than - so literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who cat@@ ered the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always conf@@ is@@ cated by children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ e@@ er@@ brü@@ tet .
that he was not only scrat@@ ched with chairs and cast the key@@ chain on the ground , but also ear@@ m@@ ly squ@@ ad guys to the hair or ears , he himself gave himself even years ago , deeply regret and apologi@@ zed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his hon@@ orary salvation , however , it has to be said that such correc@@ tive methods in the period , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents such as teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know even such breeding @-@ methods ?
of course , I think of all of us who was born in 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state of grammar school .
compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the act of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dre@@ at@@ balls .
then you wonder if it was not to do with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope so many who have never understood him , are still eager .
the truth is : the report of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report was reported in the context of the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed some kind of understanding or bro@@ therhood with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no single of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted himself to the master &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ ffer for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they do not even trust parents and sisters , then certainly not a ch@@ ord@@ al who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how to evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse falls ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : one respon@@ dent student wor@@ ded it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he had had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have been in the respective offen@@ ders .
I think it ... also for really absurd , embrace that being reck@@ oned to him ... be@@ wil@@ ful or more clear or more clearly opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory , confidence instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance affected students and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any bro@@ therhood .
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or having brought it to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these war@@ war@@ ed crimes , as unfortunately it was in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look at the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
namely , there is clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the grammar school of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report was dealt with incidents from the period since 1945 , therefore also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a conductor of the cathedral .
the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were executed and mal@@ mented , and they were en@@ force@@ able , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool at Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the domin@@ ican school .
on the other hand , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the domin@@ ican school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there is no sa@@ di@@ st violence .
and that is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims cher@@ ished the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
so at the most still the re@@ pro@@ ach , to have looked at .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and from the processes at a school , where he did not want to be and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again in 1993 .
just Georg R@@ atz@@ inger just dis@@ missed the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ school g@@ ymnasium , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed out this point out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool I continued to practice the exam@@ inees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in the face of the risk of negative press public , he recommended urgent intru@@ sion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course too a time when legal clarity was , when testing was long banned from Bavaria too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before they had occurred in a legal gray area , just like everyone of us know well .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers may have been exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but you cannot say , he had always looked at .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the trial of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair to apply the present ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the then time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; cas@@ em@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger to evaluate the preced@@ ent according to today &apos;s moral measure .
there the princess has already quite right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that time usual .
this is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ m@@ elt and drag on to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is then banned , he also kept strictly in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his rainy season Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the topic of the test and also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a secondary role .
nonetheless , I didn &apos;t bother at all that he did a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand for an un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went out twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ y alone , one does not make a big singer , and in front of every success , just in what area , yet always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of human beings have you experienced in the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and ever seen as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , genuine , deeply believers and sav@@ ory people , from which one cannot imagine that he could not just be able to do something .
I regularly get along with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still today , 23 years after its Em@@ ulation , regularly hold contact to him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him today that he was once more strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he enri@@ ches their lives and to give them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but yet also a lovely respectable age , to which they still look up today and to honor it .
and please , once again quite clear : all you need , correc@@ tive methods which were at the time of the day .
we can be glad we have overcome this time ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at .
that is the nasty intention behind it , that stands just too obvious .
for the report that was just released , dischar@@ ged him .
now , the attack was , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and won &apos;t know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen outside of Bavaria , and perhaps even in Germany the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen would probably come to make peace .
