<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt, where people should meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A hollow chapel, where now stands for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the einsty cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to catch the upright, because the car Navi showed a green meadow rather than a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geo-Portal Office of the State Government, are anything but up to date - yet very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it will be clear how towns and churches in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large coverage map there were more detailed maps, so-called urine heets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian State Department, between 1810 and 1864, and expelled out of the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops dropped off with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, the present neighbours were the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Vermeasurable administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Court of exposure for Munich dates back to 1856, and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / Today is the example of the state capital on the oppressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was formed 21 years after the card's drafting, so 1877, classified as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Subsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses underscoring is located around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at Hineinzomen a smaller card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbers from the so-called "" "" Uruptake "" "," which was derived from the tax tax. "" "</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots occupy themselves no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 places of the October fests, was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the appointment of today's Au-Haidhausen, it reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or of the level "On the Death" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, one once belonged to people with insanity exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt" "" "at the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard was headed by Gudden, the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive in his time and ended for example the accusations of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Moreover, he has banned the personnel to apply force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who occupied himself an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 sites.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East is located there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now, at the site of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and moved him to a youth home with educational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings dating back to the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children-house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was created in the architectural holding on the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was mapped by 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the merchant road was named" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big stayed to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a hollow chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are working and take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn series.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and to fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published Travel-Reports for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national association for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri by the discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which will bring special attention to the country until 28 August 2017, because a series of fragmented, racial cases occur at the last time in the entire state and here," said it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionate to minorities, the group, the group, said the NAACP, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights that humans happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped or killed because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist junkers against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after spending any gasoline during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring the money, or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri, in 2015, posted 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI, the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to stand a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberation Association (ACLU) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona, after the states passed immigration legislation to prosecute the local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to the opinion of the ACLU to further caters.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel arrangements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Consecrated project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherson Weidemagn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter white and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-grabenhof of the Schwendemann Family, representatives of the fishing bacher CDU town, together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into its operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, forty milk-cows, and as many young animals, and houses five apartments in the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black-goat milk" "" "is responsible for him from an alternative reshaphazard way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he also is the BLHV President of Fisbach, he described the "elementary" project as a "elementary" project. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not succeed on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area for much work, much must be edited with the motorcycle.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and run it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the meaning of the" "" "Holy Bible project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">For costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be gone through quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is about 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the total cost of 71 500 euros, a quarter carried by the community fishing bach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers work 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "it makes a really good job, without farmers and women it does not go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss is firm:" "" "here the best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapegoat (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of demarshes.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of one of the LPR designated conveyor products.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "in addition, the non-smoking area may not be inppery (Hangulation over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing year Weideceit Project 2018, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The moderate-area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calmed costs are at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly did what he did when he had a symbolic Axt in an heat dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller is not resorting to the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatowners and Liberty-Imitators would have sparked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it resorted to its significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta complained:" "" "I will not go here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that enlighten the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly properly properly, but as he behaved it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your tits, your poor, / your afflicted masses who are trying to breathe free, the elving waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable waste" was better to see on our monitors.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller got not engaged in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves on the basis of placing their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical cinematic representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to move it back for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great screaming as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one-invite, but rather an early Neocon, who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to enlighten the road to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something across.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they were from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">The true sense is to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue talks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that will ever recognize Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Its torch should not light the path, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loaves the team of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "black believes that" "" "in Scotland something special" "" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out," said black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Leichtasiletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew butchart - which are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiliie Doyle was elected from the crew to team capacity.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or whatever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie quite naturally brought, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal, which is due to its fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes on the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-hill Muir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman, which one should watch for a great season, which was to win the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships, as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the team member states that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "to the fact that many of their countrymen belong not only to the team but sometimes in the medals and in the Finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "it is very special about the team of the team that she was elected by the other members of the team so it was a great honor to know, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose to make it something special for me," she added. "" "</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the carrots who belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this homework and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: take not a public office if you cannot wear the heims of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from domestic policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He infiltrated with the critiques, safely.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he was not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are led as sheep to the battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland under Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">High-goose employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberals promised him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the rod of Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the on-line comment was full of a backlash with" "" "Na, and?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republique Governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State, and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with its constituents and to debate his hair-less head after chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of people who come to the page of Governors - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogans spokeswoman in Amelia Chasse the acts of Governors and argued that the Composition of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of drills or spammers or hash-filled people online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessmen and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtfully and not professors.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyers at the Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hashish, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary sector of the news "" "" The Post. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take on the same topic, then they are disrespected by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of people concerned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the government of the Governors signed in" "" "concentrated" "" "spam attack, others would probably call" "" "intercede" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era is easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is a lot of cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that staff were sent to gather newspapers with critical guides and to burn or burn protesters and silenced.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening on digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official so he criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "President Trump will be complained from Twitter users who were blocked from Twitter feeds." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue fell into Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the First Amendment, according to U.S. District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as they named a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time, Washington has had a similar impact on the time of affordable prices, such as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous envelopes to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people, the pseudonyms, such as "Jurists," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote, wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, came on his ministry, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not been silenced.</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village center."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuselle was first mentioned in the Wurttemberg Urgent book: Earl Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Maglingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the certificate on the tumour mountain, apart from the former parish church, besides the former parish church, was also a glorified courtyard, to which the church or the patronage was right and not the other way round.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly created bell set for the first time in 1692, but had to be released in 1942 later in the Second World War.</seg>

<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money is loosening, so that Neymar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the support of the team by the energy of the wealthy ruler of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations must expel a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but need to be controlled with legitimate use sources, which give them the break-up point in their way to the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheating and risky to ruin, if banks or owners have receded their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then powerfully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to a tougher path.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP-free period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was fallen by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA-successor Aleksander Ceferin will continue to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso that is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the exchange rates for the next five years can be reported in the amount of €44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has been the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are held for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to overlist their financial supervision by blown their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorings should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not apply as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsor of PSA was smiled by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar Payments to the Organic Committee of the World Cup 2006 could be held in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar FWC will be arrested and a such manoeuvres for the UEFA regulators can be easily found.</seg>

<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and trikotar purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent neymars crossing by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The great life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne did not pack their bags and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square meters has been completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a snowy layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that had 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms across each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked up to each other without forced us to fill up." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down the right height. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for the fan of placing two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine there is a classic copper light window from Retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer mirrored units for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a yarky door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so it is when you push the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², one additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials which give space to the space of its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and that will help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not miss you into the electric plugs in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly default in something quite intimate.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief of the White House, at his first working day at his first working day, he was a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information given into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should flow via him - whether on paper or in briefing - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tdump Trump by monitoring their media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps on television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his televisions is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a Candidate was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February to politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever was "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps those fighting bodies know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets could contain even more ignition without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have made it some times to keep away from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing it, that Trump controversies protrudes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house which composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by encouraging Trump material that possibly promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmakers:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press sections, above all those with shameful leaks, and that he excreed out where these come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened in late February, when someone gave the president malevolent a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be from Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was relegated because of rages, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started to ask people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmakers added that the then staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still trying to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg is driving in the Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic Arctic has solved a gigantic iceberg of the narrowly size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers big collids are now to the north and will probably be two, three years until he melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and width of up to 50 km, it is one of the largest ice-minants who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions of ovaze in the region for about 30 years, the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a faceted background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that can be related to heating.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now unbroken trooss was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the peak of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this sweep was the balance of wax and vomiting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis was crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the fore I have never withdrawn as far as presently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is at tension and could disintegrate, if there is a key point out of dropout.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level as it removes on the water and removes the ice so much water as it yields after the merge itself.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Cham, expert of the agrarian Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years was exposed to climate change impacts which has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more in fall.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt high officials and ceaseless drug war.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about certainty.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what it feels safer: you should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the aim of an attack with grenades or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plate on the front side of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug singers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting break from the violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are sworn, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto decaying his office in December 2012. 589 are available at least seven dead in seven States this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be reporter, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack is felt deep, though its presence is everywhere present - a large picture of Valdez, which is its midfinger with the word "Justice," depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts, which will show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a probe was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, these were only introduced to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings that are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they still persist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now yet dizzling.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th, Valdez abandoned the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelvth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to freely fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans reeling over the last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, because rival groups struggle to fill a vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of produced, two-story pedals for drug kens that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the debt has broken that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of the rival carton parties in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they ship to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to compel Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were persuasive that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without going to the smoking harry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the paper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to publish hard apt studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories who dared to treat no one else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spa-bird, who was like a dockers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she asked, was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced her to ask her own assumptions regarding how to get their job done best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runway," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say are in Sinaloa no longer - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-story district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described the governor themselves as being untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where the drug ties stand in facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has had three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known pit Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé about the government spending, focused on the hometown of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was provided when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally made by drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter from public records, that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy, which ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which ruled the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several prisi governors were accused due to high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before had the reader seen the columne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body statur.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers who protest against the morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Repork Miriam Ramirez snappte a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of a further journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez were killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become more marked by organized in organised protests "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez was off in Washington and tried to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez accuse the authorities to pronounce journalists, and they can bring it, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that it is divided by the government, because it is concerned that its rage has hurt its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime, were surrounded by government officials and an equally valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco-Journalism" "", "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also by command of politicians and security guards held by organised crime under a blanket." ""</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta marked by Borealopelta, named the Museum Technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astounding preservation of copies made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of scales and armors on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-variation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living in today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to that the dinosaurs bejagt the dinosaur by enough pressure by flesh's dinosaurs, that evolution favored the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals, which apply the counter-effects - think of deer, zebras, or rushing - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, what signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnition-behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveals that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotor.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his consistent Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern flourishing today, and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday night at the A8: nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass-carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, long-term rod and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), on the late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people have been wounded.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The first information from the police were between 1700Uhr and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm just under 30 cars, among them probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first the exact number of the injured was not valid at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is about light to moderate severe injury, said a polizeal preacher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great deal of liveying on bailout vehicles was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich a round of ten kilometres made of return.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The firebrigade wrote down the marks of the vehicle-glists who now have to reckon with delicate penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock then another accident occurred at the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked a online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">One also has to have bought it via the railways of the railways, the DB navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who often drives rail, knows that besides delays and pastimes the driver controls are among the biggest nuances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case one of the fellow travellers did not take all the documents to get to the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or your personal ID is missing or otherwise a document that you have to offer.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between train managers and passenger cars, which leads to poor atmosphere in the section or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the creative work at the end the time takes care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken until its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just a day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an airbnb apartment that rented them and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post of someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being saved on their timeline.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be Brownfather to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live-feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "another policeman is his gun and crying," "" "I will kill you... animals all kill." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestants, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consist of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand the answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a ferrell with her daughter, which took a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that took it countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" it reminded itself of what she said.</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experienced a clant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep it away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camparea when activists killed on the possible non-charge by officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">In there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her camera ann Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to be "documented," what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to a question of Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often of white men in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson, have not centred up their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrel's experience - to show that this is the movement "not about a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most apparent participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "" "" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" ""? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris life, as they marries in love and marries their wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the distortion of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferrells history repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader black-lives of lives.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which had shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" after the killings of the black teenager Martin in 2012, identified as a sultry.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on various fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, pregnant women must carry the main load of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted to notice that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras were gone out in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is even more important that we at least maintain the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly from the manufacturer and is obendlessly reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are located at a shopping centre just by major companies, because the dorsal rents are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2124">One suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cut-offs from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyzer was assigned a 35-year sentence after they publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline unifies its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and a pioneering doctoral researcher, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithms analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from the 30 portraits, such as anyone with this genomic data - the many modalities as they can be interpreted and the indural determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly condemned since her puberty about identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the SpionageAct, Computer Worlds and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison its image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granny, black-white rfie, in which maning is visibly weighing on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde Percented - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits of strangers made out of forensical artifacts like cigarette lighter and chewing gum, adding the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg during a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so make contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detainees Muse were remixed to unsimilar letters that have been exchangested several years over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of the Shoili Kanungo-illustrated Comic "supporter images," which would foresee a future in which the President Chelation was able to convert and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was calling for seven brutal years after seven brutal war in Kansas, was a welcome kind of blissful coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition some lowland and Starkes, since Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweet distances to the rigid divisions, which he should actually fix, continue to inflame.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Manning with its superior signature below (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazing similarly, at least in biological regard, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA-data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above comic novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a freebirelefon in his hand from the disciplinability of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if you have got your speech cold, then they have won." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers were not grieving.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing the software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, specifications and demographic groups to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases of whistleblowers allow to handle the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and FitBit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools for companies is used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low supply results - so that you can drill to why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, you do not have to be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post, which describes an environment of harassings, in which those who have spoken, were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, regulation and Compliance-sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, after the budgetary technical website Let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and realize bad behavior, saw an rising interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">How Glint, enables Convercent company tailored "Pul-" surveys, lets you collect sensitive answers in real time and see the warmth of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with the employees to report a bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business is involved, complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of public opinion has seized the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that his staff treated badly or behaved unethical, it may experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, workers escape fluctuation and clashes, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has been used convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company convercent uses, problems that were previously hidden from executives, which were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unloud internship, identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree vision into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment and disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen interrupted for ethical breaches of the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media" "" "came to their right" "" "that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy" "", "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well as Convercent provide your software as a service, and charge the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors, which both supports start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing for companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which was raised all capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers agreed to $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought the entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that pays off their voices, and that the work that you are doing, then feel more strongly obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors get renders when their portfolio companies are well running. companies run well if employees are committed and involved.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "but the data is useless if the administrator did not take action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that changes are on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, these disappointments can breed.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, the company has seen himself too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you are not following, employees will ask," "" "Habt you really listened" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you take care of it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you do not care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys now, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrating employees it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high rates.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be crazy, a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelids of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robot with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions, "and choosing things from the colour of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would make a stepford woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpups have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that they find appealing as for example shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the site of True "spy.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in the mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissal feminine properties that goes to play upon rape if you take a step on Frigid (is here: reluctant) Farrah is, bezzly a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website perched True Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper into our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not keep any sex robot, and while the FRR realises their increasing popularity, they still remain prevalent at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeated out of the edge-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is still some overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened with, in which the White House gives a president who have gears women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the ruined body and the outspoken eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peas want them to feel humane, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background history, nothing that could be seen on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the speech of 2017: service maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Jumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a tamply of the dump era that the political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest thought, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tick-elected relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly approached to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Have noticed less has been the power to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a centre-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, who visits me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican relationship, with which she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks to them.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump but the power-reaching effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the grossest possibility that we will no longer meet his / her / her messages.</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is still a frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalizes" that suddenly appear in comparison with its standards suddenly as the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urian version of the madw, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur to a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate to republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the Carussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carushes of the New York parking section, and the top three dollars that you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisy and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate-changing music gives this a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two year-old, a 11-year-old and two women can go to it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one has asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass on my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to deposit the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowing of what actually a neutral exchange should be, but also exercises pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store excused excusable, while I had tired of the experience to submit their credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius has moved to the hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the UK more than 300,000, caused gastrife and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person usually got advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner ArtenschutzübereinUniversity found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins have contributed to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to make sure that damaging microbes that hide themselves in the body, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of emulate inflammation, are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance-promoting immunologic cell on mice is found, that a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the elements of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - who is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system is also infested with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan analysed a kind of immune cell that the tolerance fosters, when it found that a group of studies had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microorganisms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The worms of mice have been sequentially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterilful environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not produce this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria out on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant ducive cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component from the liquid was purified, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan on the feed of the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanous were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant ducive cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri can protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in men as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain does not count in its pursuit of Neymar after it has given a £189 million to resolve its freewheel clause, but have they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world war?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has been halted the transferwindow in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world ord for more than the double of the previous brand, whereby Paul Pogba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.</seg>

<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced its way to the outside, although a source near the Catalans Board consists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report by the Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of waste by the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the discord at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisser, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Benedict Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret of their own omissions or their then false evaluation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "however criticized that in reporting about violence in the dominals with" "" "two measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would have to be prevented by "shameful and shameful acts" as the "degree of media manipulation," such as the "degree media manipulation," so the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Prince Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on to the church and this is a found Fressen '.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "strike a very normal educational means" "" "to be done with cheeky children as I was one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse cases, the Pope Georg Ratzinger often also emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger den Remembrance "My brother of Pope (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protecting" "", "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he adds the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the clarification of a lawyer in Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 dominals sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it is possible to record that by Domkapellmeister R. have been applied in many cases of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike many other accusations, many victims are underestimated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even associate positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "allegations of violence of violence against protection of the Regensburger Domspatzen, gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a lift, many students raise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who was prepared for the beginning of the oil, if a dominican performed musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is particularly dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the mediterranean or brotherhood during the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also, the violence at the preschool began to occur outside of its impact.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is not possible for him to find out of it too late or have taken the first hint to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the cathedral-horse school, on which he appeared, was perceived by practically all respondents than - so literally -" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger describes it as" "" "warm," "", "" "" "competent," "", "" "" "competent," "" "and" "" "understanding," "" "as extremely good-natured teachers who catered the guys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" "" "always confiscated by children" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his great emotionality, which also led to Wuteerbrütet.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he was not only scratched with chairs and cast the keychain on the ground, but also earmly squad guys to the hair or ears, he himself gave himself even years ago, deeply regret and apologized to it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "for his honorary salvation, however, it has to be said that such corrective methods in the period, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents such as teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of all of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state of grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the act of violence at the preschool, these are certainly dreatballs.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you wonder if it was not to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope so many who have never understood him, are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report of Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen report was reported in the context of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed some kind of understanding or brotherhood with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "no single of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted himself to the master" "" "Domkapellmeister" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "said a duffer for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they do not even trust parents and sisters, then certainly not a chordal who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse falls?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: one respondent student worded it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he had had (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have been in the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, embrace that being reckoned to him... bewilful or more clear or more clearly opened than against their parents, dormitory, confidence instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance affected students and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him or having brought it to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these warwared crimes, as unfortunately it was in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be" "" "look at the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is clean separated: between the preschool and the grammar school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report was dealt with incidents from the period since 1945, therefore also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a conductor of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sadist teachers were executed and malmented, and they were enforceable, all at the preschool at Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dominican school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the other hand, like most witnesses emphasise the subject "Pre-School" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the dominican school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is no sadist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And that is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims cherished the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at the most still the reproach, to have looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and from the processes at a school, where he did not want to be and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Just Georg Ratzinger just dismissed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-school gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he pointed out this point out," "" "that in the preschool I continued to practice the examinees." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in the face of the risk of negative press public, he recommended urgent intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="2966">"" "" "" "this was of course too a time when legal clarity was, when testing was long banned from Bavaria too." ""</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before they had occurred in a legal gray area, just like everyone of us know well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers may have been exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you cannot say, he had always looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the trial of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply the present pedagogical standards to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "casemck of Anachronism," i.e. the danger to evaluate the precedent according to today's moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's shrimps, that goes far beyond that time usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, thus earmelt and drag on to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is then banned, he also kept strictly in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his rainy season Georg Ratzinger has played in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of the test and also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nonetheless, I didn't bother at all that he did a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for an unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of Weltrang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went out twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bony alone, one does not make a big singer, and in front of every success, just in what area, yet always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of human beings have you experienced in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have seen Georg Ratzinger very well and ever seen as a wonderful, humorous, genuine, deeply believers and savory people, from which one cannot imagine that he could not just be able to do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get along with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after its Emulation, regularly hold contact to him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him today that he was once more strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and to give them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but yet also a lovely respectable age, to which they still look up today and to honor it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: all you need, corrective methods which were at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the nasty intention behind it, that stands just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now, the attack was, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and won't know the Regensburger Domspatzen outside of Bavaria, and perhaps even in Germany the Regensburger Domspatzen would probably come to make peace.</seg>
