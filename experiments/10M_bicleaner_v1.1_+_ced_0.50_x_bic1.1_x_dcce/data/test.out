Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put up in drawers or get hi@@ ked from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are more dangerous to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
at the dearest time , the ac@@ tress spends her time at home , in front of a TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the whit@@ eboard they spend the question about the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women have not to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger searched for Lan@@ ger with some colleagues a little variety with a horseback riding on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remember their holiday , they said in the fast gal@@ lop home to the for@@ aging .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended again already again .
on Saturday , Germany was best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournaments sie@@ ge - back in the proximity of horses .
he allowed himself to carry out himself with his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not take any time for photography .
it was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German Sports help was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on awards , it lacks the sympathetic athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bundes@@ ver@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already led him down .
the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro immediately .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two US master@@ s@@ winner took place on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent are the athle@@ tics Hart@@ mut Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ves , the fai@@ th@@ ah Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob Young Driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the manus@@ crip@@ ts of Erhard .
many of these sports@@ men were on Saturday at Aachen .
after the official part moved the illustr@@ ative society into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Com@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential courses are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
that , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to bend the economy to death and adjust to death , he says .
he himself would be very different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely cycle on regulations , and he stands strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has disadvantage opportunities and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost password @-@ like .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ aching of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
thus , the internal discussions could still be given on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more visible .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and re@@ funds coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement wants to announce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast with their investment programme , Clinton intends to expand and demand the renewable energy investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ osition @-@ fish trade agreement , they both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both Americans want not to isol@@ ate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the should then also be paid better , calls for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wages .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage does not have to be changed , then he may not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , which aims to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out to him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every frozen woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women , who run alone , almost for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women .
each has a baby with it , which is at most one year old .
one has laid their little son in his arm .
he gu@@ ises with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ ed to the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until we speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the department of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals among others with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are spot@@ ted .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no other men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not excessive to say : every woman who arrives here has gained experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men escape for wars because they are politically persecuted , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at women other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal from it secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ orary mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs ask for example for a bottle of water a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here , all women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worse .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich &apos;s north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or she does not trust to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not cure themselves , there are more accommodations only for them , asks danger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria the seven districts will be responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question whether they were kis@@ sed by a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in lodging of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , alone , women alone will not be separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ preaching of the Government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some Community shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy or will be accommodated together for men and women , it can be - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women in the study .
how much women feel this protective experience can be felt at the cr@@ yo@@ del , which there is in Munich to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since around , we have spoken that we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new labour measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proxy in the assistance of assistance have prompted her union to approve new labour measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire council to approve more work measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it had failed to respond to concerns about the contract .
medical practitioners and medical students have voted in July about the ref@@ usal of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members who published on Twitter on Thursday evening , said the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government was pers@@ ist@@ ently kept quiet , &quot; what led to the treaty was refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this has voted the J@@ DC board to completely reject the proposed new contract and be concerned with official new negotiations for all their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board approved today a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a running program aimed at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the assistance of the medical practitioners of this year , the first general incidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istent Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election on the election of the agreed contract conditions adopted by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that still occurred before the vote of 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ practitioners and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim a official end of the eight months of the long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Peter &apos;s Palace in reception , I cannot f@@ end the intru@@ sion that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation most .
there was the shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked out mal@@ ignant and he hardly l@@ acked any heat , even for its returning conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times .
I could no longer count it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved as if never had something wrong .
it seemed to me to interpret the contrary rather the opposite .
but one of the Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that Russia &apos;s head of Russia had forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introduc@@ tions : the shut@@ down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was horri@@ fied .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in their back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
to rebuild their ve@@ away is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most severe officials believed that Erdogan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , which could be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
finally , this meeting only took place because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdogan whom he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear on hand .
Erdogan is in the first place all friends who he can get after last month at a failed state coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the visual television , cheap fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti wor@@ ded it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes for long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as there was a weak answer to the attempted power of power .
moreover , the continuing res@@ entment of the snow @-@ accession of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian leader in Ankara won certainly a bonus that he sought after a coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected government system .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which even has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace made by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries who violate the West and badly treats himself from the West .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support conflic@@ ting sides .
it might signi@@ fy that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both Presidents met at the press conference , they had not even stressed the subject .
the President of Turkey inten@@ ed to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found on Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as the NATO member Turkey the Russian Batt@@ le@@ age - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had to speak at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland no longer available
according to the leader of the R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back office according to the leader of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan sharing the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since removed himself as she almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time br@@ aces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported international sport with millions of pounds for sponsorship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to push more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales every RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ l .
the brand of Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand where our employees are to be employed as we are now more involved in a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue global targets , but follow local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to evolve to the bank of the brands , for how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; he said the manager .
three years ago , it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and that these marks will be launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can start these brands again , so I think the time has come .

he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track , with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth yo@@ ckey that reached the milestone in the flat @-@ race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ god , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the dre@@ av@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is here too
I am very happy that it &apos;s going to happen at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bel , when he fet@@ ches the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth der@@ og@@ sie@@ ger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers .
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekend and a big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been winning in Britain for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .

three years ago he had suffered difficulties when he returned from his six months spar@@ row , but he showed an impressive character@@ ful strength in order to de@@ fy its branches and to return to his funeral .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori was once said that he wants to continue at a minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fires Staff in Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Chief of Chief of Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ka was a couple of years part of the narro@@ west of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ atives for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy managing director since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( on Russian ) that it was later appointed chairman and chief executive director of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your occupation as President of Law and Control to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broadcast@@ er on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended v@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the closest Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as chief of chief , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men argued that the Chief of chief will res@@ ign on his own desire .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this now knows no one .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as potential president , to once want to lead Russian environmental policy - came across big scep@@ ticism .
in his comments to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website said Ivan@@ ov &quot; it &apos;s true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated positions - you could almost say - troubles@@ hooting for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the state security service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , the K@@ GB was appointed , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin got to power he called Ivan@@ ov than one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third presidential term of coup against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching associates Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the north deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ways with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four folding of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ted rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
M. Keit@@ h Brown , the building site today was a visit and was one of the first to come to the bridge from the country .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ bar .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of engineering from a truly epic size in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise tolerance for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the entire bridge de@@ cks at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets a beg@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , meaning that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first reference represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project the sh@@ utter is presenting trend @-@ setting construction and low @-@ construction .
after installing the last road cover , and its connection with which in the expansion of the North Atlantic , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long is , about 6,000 tonnes , and at a slope of about 3 % had to be pulled up .
heat , as the toler@@ ances , which the team were working , tiny - on each side they carried only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .

who builds Braunschweig for cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should in future be taken much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is pre @-@ programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the affordable apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD member CEO Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , must be in future 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be established in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue of the city hall is such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to go up with investors to build upon private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as high as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost million costs and will still be financed , should be incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left still does not want to provide tough conditions for investors .
regardless of , so viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the program does not yet exist : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
how do you like the loss of other around 1300 @-@ advantageous apartments , whose funding will continue over the next few years ?
only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory spokes@@ woman in Nicole Palm , should now be bought for ongoing ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price list .
this is possible in the Western town .
on one fell sw@@ oop the problem could be solved .
because in the west town the end of the year comes to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the residential companies .
because the number of social housing apartments in the West Bank is re @-@ dras@@ tically raised , one removes himself from the goal of the so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling .
a concentration of social weak in just a few urban districts will not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens make sure that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group of Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go by boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile .
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on monitors on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later this came into a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture declined in front of the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postponed due to massive demand that over@@ lap the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players take their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which re@@ jects the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ sten , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 3@@ 5.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent to j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engage in deaf ear , because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued .
whoever drives exercise regularly , reduces its chances to become ill to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they have fun .
the three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are cosm@@ opol@@ y toys , which have always to complain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps as Fit@@ Bit had already been following our activity previously , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its all@@ ure and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ ina
forget the print .

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year American turbines on Thursday to the multi @-@ struggle title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total count of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ sc@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es during the individual multi @-@ campus of women in the art world during the Olympic summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , who wins a multi @-@ struggle title , and in total the fifth , while its reputation is consoli@@ dating the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out into tears when their final result was shown and their long journey was an end to that moment .
this success makes them the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es the last three years has dominated its sport , 15 world championship - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton from her said that she is &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected one final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campus of women in the art world during the Olympic Summer 2015 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal at Tuesday while she was the retirement party of retired ass@@ istants in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as instructor .
although it existed , during its long distance to the top , never have the future planned , it is not really true .
part of its soil exercises - which included its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit in Rio on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight into the g@@ ymnasium , in which bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ ded was in force .
it has been no longer lost competition for summer 2013 , a strainer series that will last as long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two spins , the picture clou@@ ded .
floating and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - where Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - lau@@ ded .
she brought again to the pig with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 and sat down on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged them gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ um - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears p@@ inn@@ ed on fine red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that once described in her collective book , became reality .
the Ra@@ is@@ mans performance was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but bronze medals went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ capitalism had called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; which is named by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their exercise , she threw on to the audience to get away from a com@@ eback , which sometimes was doub@@ tful .
as for the purpose of this , it has quickly expanded T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series @-@ murder@@ ers in a car shot in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were killed , which were killed in one of the deadly attacks in one of the first mass murder@@ ous attacks during a decade , while they were talking in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a single drive , the authorities said .
the do@@ ers fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police shared with the fact that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder didn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ case , as the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which was owned by an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ al@@ ker of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sli@@ der led the investigation to become a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed primarily in Hisp@@ anic dwelling within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used multiple vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sli@@ des@@ y , which resulted in an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the work of a serial killer .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and sur@@ passed a bul@@ let from the seat as well as her@@ edi@@ mente from the engine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 years , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its aging has Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know anything .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I managed not .
I managed not .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course one has left behind it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund they may never realize her under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &quot; &quot; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help@@ desk .
Edmund could not sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of age , and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the gyp@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the gyp@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminded of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects that have been caused by the gyp@@ avirus .
it is getting better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine doing among the women &apos;s Olympic Games in Tur@@ nen and this is more than one reason .
first of all I have been at any summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this squ@@ ad , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ dine is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Kath@@ o@@ lic@@ in , are round off , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ men an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ ic winning Olympics and the United States .
now the world was able to be witnessing the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ed G@@ ym@@ atic rout@@ inely supplied .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual Americans who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campus event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but do not see agri@@ classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like Tur@@ ning a dear@@ er sport is and Tur@@ ner combine first and foremost in private trainers that are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnis@@ hing , travel - and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their g@@ ymn@@ ast and families ) . the list can continue to continue .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
in these verses the g@@ ymn@@ ast will receive their overall training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we must give the con@@ greg@@ ations countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an active and easy @-@ to @-@ reach trainers .
I have established my turn@@ outs for 20 years .
we offer free and affordable tur@@ keys in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ ers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits to health and for training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team member and thank you , so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance practitioners would like to organise further strikes after they refused by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistant who voted in a vote refused him off .
in July Hun@@ t plans refused to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS was committed to a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land , &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance for the first assistance should be given a new contract , the changes to night and weekly work will be required to improve the maintenance of the night watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A com@@ mons shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ass@@ istent may have serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current staff crisis and administered to deal with all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining , until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and the time is running out .
the efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve any disputes over the government on the sake of the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened that the saying that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only made last month , that his door was always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must now act , raise the order and address the worries of the assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , they have made the assistance of assistance that they are prepared to perform other work amp@@ ut@@ ations .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 terminology , as nur@@ ses and medical practitioners were involved to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ days for the 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istent that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance to quit the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures do not achieve anything of the only little but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient who care and their families only worries , poverty and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have addressed the assistance of the assistance of assistance and the Ministry of Health , as well as other ministries , concerns concerns with regard to the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication can be lower the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the ger@@ ent drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 1,@@ 0@@ ,000 people every year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of this suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries &apos;s walls .
when the Bel@@ ag diver@@ ts , it can cause a blood th@@ inner to clo@@ gs the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood flow is sol@@ dered , it can flow through the blood flow and obstruc@@ t the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ probable .
the draft bill of N@@ ICE who has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health care centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
by preliminary recommendations from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this time period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ al@@ on can flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year on leaving a government report about corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ital has led to it that widespread electoral attacks in Muslim communities will know@@ ingly ignor@@ ed@@ ingly like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet maker Sir Eric Pic@@ ks inv@@ ades the police , electoral campaigns , and Rath@@ ehouses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nie and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and Communist government , who is now a cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ring , said that intimi@@ dation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so badly that the police should be allowed to settle shel@@ ters outside of choices to protect intimi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a de@@ jo@@ vice to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er must simply call its name and address .
the report proposes not to rise to the finger of a person if they vote their votes to prevent any one chooses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls that the press should have greater access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to vote , it is also intended to protect the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the am@@ ti@@ zing may@@ Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be put to corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in an Cypriot manner , &quot; that he had sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ is@@ sm@@ al and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ tful or the consequence of an im@@ itation in which a person chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud across the country .
he expressed particular alert to frau@@ dul@@ ent stamp - with the older members of the Muslim community to have pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the feeding of ways to prove the identity
in his report it is stated : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the determination of the elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ era or ban@@ ish background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such behaviour would have ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are to be dealt with , to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires the harder registration audi@@ ts to prevent that the choice of choice is used to immig@@ rate and social @-@ activities .
consider options to ask voters prior to your opinion .
do not remove remot@@ ely ink on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent any one chooses twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit to requests to an automatic let@@ tering .
prohibition that political activists process complete let@@ sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of stamp @-@ elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have authority to settle shel@@ ters for electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a modification , which facilit@@ ates a charge of intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( representatives of the 1983 Act 1983 ) .
photography was offered in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the staff will rule out that voters want to go alone in the electoral cabin .
Sir Eric is about the Metropolitan Police and it is &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets do not show any accus@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lam@@ in@@ duction of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ hair checks &quot; of the constitu@@ tion@@ able departments of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court of Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country contributes to the mother of parliaments as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral attacks and cand@@ y of some regul@@ ators threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the hunter and the wolf : Mann@@ ing member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
besides K@@ ates double @-@ party on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people on the Internet point to that like a certain arch@@ scor@@ er of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star Un@@ vei@@ led .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given ins@@ anity to the social media with and gave to that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any big similarity , except the facial hair , &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I win it as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking similarity between the British am@@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian g@@ ymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to pass through a col@@ der for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh was compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the actor .
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal oscill@@ ated in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ ond hair as the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans attack , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others have fallen the similarities .
theory contained in the space : according to this user , there may be one reason for the similarity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the US @-@ football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face and eyes .
other popular comparisons embr@@ aced Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their sm@@ iles , which is almost identical to the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles its own gorgeous , wide smile , similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised at the end of 90 times in the people who responded to the crew via Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologize in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC kop@@ ated and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also apologi@@ zed and gave a communication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that they will be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have quickly apologi@@ zed to our audience members at the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer@@ in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were inadequate and an unhappy chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for the comment that I have made for the comment that I did after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ rons in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ ure , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat down on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ t about woman , who tried to sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mate to try sau@@ cers .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she , as she looked at it , she pulled out and put her back into the shelf .
you just browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , on .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the shop without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the stalls , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the base , drew its own shr@@ ubs and pants and try them .
&quot; they did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - they just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each soli@@ di@@ fied , when they moved the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like , as they put them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub @-@ pants before she finally decided that her was nothing going back and r@@ out .
&quot; she did not bother to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or about the person who would buy under the circumstances she had tried . &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How ref@@ utable to think that someone would take shelter with home who had another person and who were not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have helped , the staff tried to draw the clothes pieces from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had she and she had not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is fully aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little safer place .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ der in New York to find out how to handle armed rob@@ bers on distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind the rear , this video will show you how you turn around for your predat@@ ors .
when you approach you from behind , then you should turn off as a first , so you can see your att@@ acker and move from the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon between your front and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bows .
then strike it down with the knee in the gro@@ in and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker attacks against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back , while they judge the weapon upon him .
with att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun from its grip before they move backwards and set the gun at it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ power .
but remember that at a rob@@ bery at the safest , your money is too crowded - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .

a British travel insurance under@@ went its immune system and lit@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious testing - by taking some of the narro@@ w@@ est and ec@@ at@@ est places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ab@@ ed his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher @-@ slip and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
in front of the deriv@@ ative of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ tom@@ eter to show us and to show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment that was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ en@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought to drop the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a train station , which was already used by thousands of others , may actually be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact you are in a kitchen sin@@ ks more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals concerning the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately left nothing , what he stretched , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to sink down from toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely placed under a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was just in line with his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial dropped a lumin@@ om@@ eters of over 4000 units .
in comparison with this the lumin@@ escent age of fresh @-@ sized hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters for 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel guide &quot; The L@@ ick@@ en@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes the worst that I have taken in a toilet , near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing short of dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ en@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is composed of Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted the consumers to offer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probi@@ otics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming by the fact that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products , we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in the gut is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me lost my respect for Ian , if he would have tasted some of things I would like to lead him , just like the ek@@ eli@@ ke Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian , to swal@@ low them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of respondents rep@@ lied l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent reported that they may at least occasionally use products that included p@@ adding l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ Social Family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social residence after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they terror@@ ises their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
since they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , they found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able state .
the walls ap@@ plau@@ ded holes , wooden ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped , garbage was disper@@ sed at the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
she said , &quot; It was a nightmare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is as well .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that had joined the family , fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , intimi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ aming , streams and flu@@ kes included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour .
in some rooms of the house which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
it became in the property , in which in the past drugs tra@@ ded , the char@@ ds were ri@@ pped .
neighbours said that they had to fight them on the streets and regularly visited the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ ors them and her partner this week res@@ am@@ assed by the estate after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation were che@@ ered by facilitated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She told him no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that it had the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was founded in regular intervals , 20 years long
at the over@@ grown side of the communal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys have been thrown down .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there is the r@@ aci@@ ers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family as a del@@ usion is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing holds .
it was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been brave to join us and have given us the information to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and gives the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that leaves back on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation .
workers of the house@@ management are now needed garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found via 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ an@@ ages , parap@@ hr@@ ine and cash in height of £ 1.@@ 700 .
skel@@ eton received a penalty after they had been found guilty of the ownership of a drug of class B in trade review .
it claimed that the money was for a funeral of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came into a car accident in 2013 .
having gone without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room@@ mates of the house were awarded gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will hold ten@@ ant , which do not hold onto the house order .
Angela C@@ row is shared by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house @-@ order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never be criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal moved in panic , once a ti@@ tu@@ alized military jet is flying
sun@@ an@@ be@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a portu@@ gu@@ ed P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the air forces placed an incredible storm @-@ flight
the air forces said that it was on a training flight , but pers@@ isted that no security threat was required
this was the moment , in the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after being cr@@ acked by a narrow jet of a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aer@@ op@@ lane flew close to the sun@@ ni@@ ers at the beach @-@ section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed out when they began to worry about the noise of the kis@@ sed pieces , without seeing first of what caused by the clouds upon them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who tried videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
Nun@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was down to me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and unbelie@@ v@@ ably deeply .
the Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion flight was found on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly deep that this was the only way to recognize it .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to the bad visibility of view is somewhat deeper than usual , but the air forces insisted that security was at no time at risk .
Fle@@ mish estates have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot had to fly too low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire use - as deep as its viewpoint
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
Catal@@ ans arrive in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Seville , the back @-@ play rises three days later at the Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ man has to do without the sub@@ t@@ arian c@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe @-@ league champion amongst others on nec@@ ym@@ ar who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
there are also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen .
the German exp@@ atri@@ ates a b@@ ari@@ zing in the training , with which the question of Bar@@ ca occurs at least initially only in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen we@@ t@@ len@@ ders in Barcelona have been around the status as number one for two years .
Coach Luis En@@ rique was afraid of a clear decision on this so far and did Bra@@ vo in the League , but doing so T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of the other applicants .
before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt on the Spanish Master Zweifel about the fitness status of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the trial stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co . still did not really convince .
Sevilla in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat for extension in the European Super@@ cup to di@@ gest real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona has so far been winning the record winner in this review .

bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic indicator was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they did not have any co@@ aches with themselves .
they had withdrawn on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their prot@@ ectors in fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had been trac@@ eable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the scores of the gold and silver medal with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expec@@ tedly .
Ma was struggling with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
after that , he saw the temp@@ o at the plate and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points .
the superiority of Ma not developed the anticipated match match .
however , it was possible to see enough breath @-@ alter@@ ations .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the White @-@ Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans had committed himself in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Championship , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was afterwards in medical treatment , &quot; in the end she had to settle &quot; with lead .

Donald Tr@@ ump sp@@ inn@@ ed and da@@ unting issues ″ in the electoral campaign
the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans will have pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to depri@@ ve their majority .
presidential @-@ did@@ at Donald Tr@@ ump gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can high@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire has reported something like concerns expressed , such as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 rivals within the one &apos;s own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians , who asked for support in major federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he took back his well @-@ known media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can high@@ bur@@ ies w@@ ack@@ ets
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Re@@ public@@ ans .
a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June according to Tr@@ ump and his competitor from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , on the same .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Washington and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump on the question as he wanted to stop the march of Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and if afterwards , this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does not do anything else , to tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to Press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump will be threatened to strike mon@@ ies in support of his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of making the candidates of Re@@ public@@ ans for Congress much stronger among the arms .
Olympia : three che@@ ating fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ist in the event .
Kenya &apos;s L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten threatened after the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after a beg@@ ging test by a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee appointed as soon as possible a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act to investigate the case .
a ken@@ i@@ an@@ ischer official had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , sent a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ um@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controversy .
the World association IA@@ AF has requested information about the case in order to add its own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I , the sample and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 metres in the Beijing world cup .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics @-@ delegation Michael Rot@@ ich were deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is supposed to have informed about money deposits of his country through pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media reports according to his return at the Nairobi airport should be arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing promises for a longer time under special observation .
in the announcement made by the IO@@ C more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls before the Rio games , it was pointed out before that especially athlete from Kenya and Russia are taken into a visionary .
the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
subsequently , the W@@ ada Kenya picked up from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reporting the ARD have always been re@@ pro@@ ached that in Kenya , the dop@@ ing remedy is easily accessible and there will be a considerable mentality of the sport .
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had put them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in addition , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type and systematically crow@@ ned .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were then excluded from the summer playing .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical captain of Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classi@@ cal and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in the Orch@@ ester@@ dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ dered Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really enjoyed Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli is playing a older Maria .
she reminds himself with melanchol@@ y to their families with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musically @-@ exceptional !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character I used as a redness , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an extremely generous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dly is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American film@@ maker Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we left the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want it .
they are the same topics , and they are just as expres@@ sive as they were at that time .

London Schul@@ m@@ n , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za SU@@ LT@@ ANA , one of three British girls , who settled in London last year in order to join the IS , repor@@ tedly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family went from her death a few weeks ago by her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was believed that they were killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , IT@@ V News on Thursday .
SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had anticipated to leave the war @-@ exploited country and to return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good in it is - as a warning and warning to others that are the risks involved in a war zone - people to prevent this decision ever to make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went to an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ans family was told they married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was a widow .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential election of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton concluded the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the Maj@@ ority at Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain level of assurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker at Rei@@ d later said that he had not spoken with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ ics team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation District for the District of Columbia .

Turkey : the Kurdish community counting on mass evasion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on packed bags , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the end of the freight @-@ related foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany expects a number of thousands of people who flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; believes the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the tough action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass cur@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; at the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand @-@ thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; world &quot; from Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had passed over months ago with criminal offen@@ ders , whether 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ ted put@@ sch , even secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will start anew in Europe if they continue to be sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state owned by itself refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leader made by the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in this way Erdogan wants to increase the daily shift to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or sold over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government called for the government to keep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as against Erdogan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany I find a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
I &apos;m not confident in the last months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also fears the flight of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition positions .
the fire @-@ mark as a freight pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on gri@@ ps , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal on figures of the Federal Ministry of Labour , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum @-@ based asylum seekers in Germany before the coup d &quot; put@@ sch .
on 30 June this was 11.@@ 386 people , and by almost 29 percent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , you will not find war , poverty or fu@@ sions .
asylum justified according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives receive nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for stupid as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat , and land @-@ elections - which bites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the natives , who are to be convinced of the electoral fighters are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are on the land , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
these come practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the end , count only exhausted .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last days of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an even electoral campaign by just over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting how strong newcom@@ er to M@@ Ds are inter@@ sec@@ ting and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , you can see from his major pl@@ agues .
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , as it did as well as his legendary friend &apos;s predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors did get cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame at the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of af@@ ah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major cl@@ es@@ hips ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the northeast .
but the target group was not , there were more Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U refra@@ ined largely on the usual election sets on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noted that in the country it is the base that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left hand , the SPD , the Green : in the vast@@ ness of the country hardly any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U campaign co @-@ imposed on his collaborators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats have finally ended with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ for@@ ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD had not yet gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue of the holiday @-@ need for a modern virtue and reloc@@ ated their electoral campaign mainly to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online electoral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green vot@@ er campa@@ igning on don@@ ating search for local stimul@@ us among the tourists .
sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ vy straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ sburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ reconstruction : visiting sites under blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is restored , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and until at 8 pm , there is always praise .
&quot; they have done everything quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the jet @-@ gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no escape .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south on the weekend to the south , until the end of October all will be ready .
the de@@ bug is also praised for construction works , for instance when it comes to setting up pers@@ isting cru@@ ises .
since the construction site arrived on Monday to the south and also the block of Asp@@ erg@@ is@@ road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the way to go through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the main @-@ technical management of the rehabilitation leaders Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of bach@@ elor Street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sha@@ fts were seeking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
since the speed b@@ umps are not met , the church increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable floo@@ ding , &quot; says King , who made themselves place themselves on the spot .
there were already two to three per minute .
the fastest was 77 km per hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the building site moved , however it has become quieter .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ Rehabilitation has led to them to increase in turnover , anyone who asks you to look through .
however , some more and some are less concerned .
those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also that of course is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already an exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the hosts have made it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be happy with every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales bu@@ ffer rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has been asking for a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there would be a financial compensation , the host site benefited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 Now it must also include the disadvantages , which surrender to the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where there was a little more generous .
in all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his hosts will continue .
after all , the family business has been here already since 17@@ 15 , he pointed to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are less common due to complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you cannot go down , it is also somewhere nice .
that his trunk @-@ clicks after the end of the re@@ development work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 construction works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hosts in its long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly in the name of the terrorist fight against laws is rob@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will now take a thick@@ ening package .
but what has a dem@@ nific@@ status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ ases say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Minister of Germany in the presentation of his new security books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not demand anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
even this participation I participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Interior Minister , he would be situated on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arranged consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère was reported a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , commented : that a new safety agency should take care of the cr@@ acking enco@@ ded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for air passengers and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are not surprising .
for part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not yet to do with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ izing for terrorist groups and de@@ cks the jihadists with dou@@ bling citizen citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The CD@@ U @-@ Man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of that , it is still reasonable for reasonable and nothing , which in case of co@@ ali@@ ating partners have no chance .
a few new ideas presented at Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they partially have it in themselves : he plans fast @-@ to @-@ postpon@@ ements for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ formation of people in front of deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country are supposed to check their smartphone in and leave social @-@ media accounts for a security check .
when asylum for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to pose some worse than so far - about such that crimes commit or their papers throw away to conce@@ al their identity .
some of them is politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
man@@ ches also has un@@ ob@@ ased and leaves questions openly .
and with some points - in the unequal treatment of un@@ patient , for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to make an excuse for the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
moreover , many people were worried about the high refugee numbers around security .
and things that the people are deeply occupied , now let not exp@@ el themselves in election periods .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly holding their position on the subject of internal security .
in the last few days the two parties went up .
only a gar@@ ly argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then through a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the resort leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also stand here in an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return from the double pass , he kept nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
new to do is not sensible .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he gives constitutional concern .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable , &quot; it has yet to show itself .
there is a lot of things in what could be held for dispute .
but the SPD also tries to present itself with the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes not only careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to raising security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still occurs Volkswagen glimp@@ ses through .
despite diesel wars , the pay @-@ off pay worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running around .
in the back @-@ back campaign , there is a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries to the second half @-@ year .
in the past year , Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can decline in the course of the year despite the diesel aff@@ aires due to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the core brand VW is weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and lo@@ dged with it again the total sale , as noted in the D@@ ax company .
in the world , the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , following China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the same period of the previous year .
in the home market Germany c@@ anned the supplies for almost one h@@ exag@@ on .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it was commissioned in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; a department of purchasing .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote also charged the British vote for res@@ ignation from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhau@@ sts initially escal@@ ated first , also continues to become a minus .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected house in the Lower Saxony is still further glimp@@ sed through the diesel scandal : after the first seven month &apos;s just a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles on bu@@ che .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler managed to continue a sales split from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen in this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had been tam@@ pered with a software subscription .
in Germany alone , approximately 2.5 million wag@@ ons is calling for an upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of the vehicles it does not provide any deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or mot@@ oring time .
the Motor@@ auer set the client after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed equal &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in business trips .
the cause of any legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen grant its German customers a guarantee for ru@@ sting diesel models .
this would have confirmed this last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Labor .
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Labor Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that the use of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or mot@@ oring after the upgrade does not take any deterior@@ ations , and have all the type of licence @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was made in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; guar@@ ant@@ y , Volkswagen provides the opportunity that customers get a half @-@ year after the retro@@ fit for example with an engine handling in a workshop - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is with any other damage that have nothing to do with the bug@@ ging scandal , to any uncertainty as possible with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it was called .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see demands from rich savings in future ( in future ) as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ up accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association of German banks speaks of an individual case and doesn &apos;t see a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity would need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to fear for their spar@@ se criminal offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
camps banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay for its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on pl@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ up accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been killed 40 million Euros for a long time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the others and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for any million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle is now further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply to leave in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four hol@@ dings , I do not want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the customers would have sympathy and altern@@ ated rarely on other investment forms .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused by all banks significant costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone contribute to , be &quot; commercially viable not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pris@@ ons for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made headlines with their sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Guide of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay nationwide to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and austerity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the te@@ ger@@ n@@ see there &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chin @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is a wealth of wealth from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank if they charge free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gen@@ o@@ cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will charge a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man said Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen People and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to neg@@ atives with private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the migration from investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to please this in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle aged woman love plates .
before you share the commentary in order to bor@@ row it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ aging age with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most noted revival of sound plates is not limited to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which would like the re@@ alism of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ ser@@ by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for himself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho , a modest gray suit and wild , before I stand , my hands hold and something determin@@ ative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of so@@ hos slowly gains in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I made by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data of middle ages , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day due to a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and again items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things when I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I drinks not very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers , which he meets to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and ask themselves to buy their old records again .
by the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold their records to buy them CDs , sell their CDs to get back their records , &quot; says he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the plate of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took an impetus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel b@@ lown away from the digital world and want to withdraw from the stability of familiar sound@@ pl@@ atten@@ ds , by objects , the happy jewel@@ s .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is with me as collectors so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to go mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ atten@@ ds a staff of a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month they have not heard yet .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I die through a st@@ ak of Bos@@ sa Nova Komp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ ph@@ ä@@ en@@ as@@ pe@@ kt &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put them into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it &apos;s happening definitely .
more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which only slowly come .
barrel that has dedicated the sound records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle aged .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz . speakers from speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks unusual but na@@ ve psychological trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach if you stand for approximately 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the vari@@ ance of the boards .
it is making a shop of a shop of a shop .
she does not earn much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loved sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business from which is said that a new generation of plate lovers is to have inspired : urban ou@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that je@@ ans the hot@@ spot , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , which group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to attach them .
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most of for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and in online for@@ en , un@@ considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through Lake Con@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the rigid look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator who asc@@ ends over the shoulders of the middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects the offer of demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a special offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial session this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional transactions within those individuals within the camp merchandise , sell cigarettes to duck , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 pers ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture was argu@@ ing that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ction risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the stores and restaurants are important since the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional business , but sp@@ ans that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s Café des Camp , which is a non @-@ profit and French classes , as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was meant that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closing the closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe , the recent eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxili@@ ary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated that the number of people have risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep rise of new arri@@ vals throughout the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains a comb@@ ative
despite his dis@@ closing show in the Olympic Time , Rad@@ i Tony Martin will not want to get started .
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in view , keep confident and struggles , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro in Facebook .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly speaking it is hard to comment the time of yesterday said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons for de@@ acon would have led to the deb@@ acle .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will take a look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can for instance be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction or walking bridges with temporary template , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bubble for the compliance of the speed limit .
a continuous mobile structure can however be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as access ban on time , ri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ time condition one can move the pend@@ ant according to the manufacturer with any car with tags .
so that it is not easy to go out , he is lowered in the measuring run , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear into the safe outside .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign agencies also flas@@ hes out with the new technique : recently , France has collected 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain Br@@ ing silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master &apos;s class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to a rup@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at a rup@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten up in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage .
Fiji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , pushing , scheduled run and ro@@ her power to win gold - her first Olympic champion of any colour .
defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad tro@@ phy of silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they were able to take great pride in their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to the finals .
but irrespective of this , Fiji on this form could have been a 15 @-@ man team in that form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago it lost under Ryan of each game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is we@@ aving to do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started and left the attacks of GB@@ s for fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , as if one would go into driving buses 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au left over in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack on the right @-@ hand corner which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly accepted the ball .
a hectic bustle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but there has been Fiji on Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch @-@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by other weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fiji on it was born to play the 7 while GB still un@@ det@@ ects .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ lian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started a try for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South cons@@ ulate , whose fans were che@@ eks , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff t@@ opped , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced himself and GB k@@ ic@@ ked crus@@ hing in the tur@@ f .
earlier in the day , Fiji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain ended South Africa in a scarce mid @-@ season from the race - British transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive piece of work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , assured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by a fight with the cancer of the trainer for the Ru@@ der@@ si@@ eg
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ ts gold as with these games and that wants to hot .
from the first stop to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve that will go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her gol@@ den@@ em moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only the two who sat at the Ru@@ gs , there were three voices in the boat . the Ech@@ o of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when she moved to the second Olympi@@ as in two without a tax result , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which had such a scale .
their dominance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 4 un@@ curved use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athlete who gli@@ de on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not reflected the type of painting .
behind each gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on will contribute to willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no one assistant as the trainer who would not survive this day before , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he is risky .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start in early 2014 , out of season , could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that in such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who had a nerve @-@ ven@@ ing morning to talk something more than usual and thus tried to handle his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repeated , how much I mean that how much I and Helen , and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person or would like to wish for a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost not a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in the process , remain in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not sug@@ gesting something Great .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as well as we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV adventur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to grasp that I am a Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years for clarity taken care of clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ eit@@ ch @-@ group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , enters the retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian @-@ exemplary . &quot;
a small fr@@ Frank@@ ish drinking water purpose bound as a model for the large water@@ producers .
it was built some time ago in the origin@@ al@@ on in an article by the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum of the Government of under@@ mine defended the Second World .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ch @-@ group was &quot; Bav@@ arian , &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Second World Bank , was 28 years as managing director .
at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with the headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of broad@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and past@@ ors with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the churches of the Church of church , wides@@ creen , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ tah .
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
the current president , wides@@ creen mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ de Mo@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 were appointed as a water@@ front and has already been appointed Managing Director of the Second World War .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , the budget@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency actions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property sales in the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , re@@ building the high vessels ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the ponds of water pipes .
there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always recorded new additions because water &apos;s life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ llers tru@@ sty , reliable and accurate service for 31 years .
he has engaged himself with a lot of heart for its water@@ purpose and it has been implemented in the water @-@ purpose federation , as it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago , he was a true practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ es @-@ group to the nit@@ rate of water at the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller @-@ on the other praised water@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked with him 28 years .
he is the best water@@ front and he was a devoted boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he described the fountain and the re @-@ structured of the Second @-@ Association .
the biggest challenge and the hardest use were the pel@@ ic@@ tion in the reservoir in the chur@@ n on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work through so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn is also only possible to maintain them , because it filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with vents .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was passed to Daniel Stür@@ mer from a lou@@ der , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the most vulnerable and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burden , which is threatened by the industry from the oil industry , are from the table .
it ab@@ ides for the liberation of renewable energy supplies to the so @-@ called Eig@@ enst@@ ro@@ m@@ production in the German steel industry , the German Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Zeitung Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that after two years we were able to finally reach negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases of the Ho@@ cho@@ fen to generate electricity for their own consumption , at the cash desk .
the steel industry depends on additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , it now give a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with Com@@ peti@@ tor Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , fine an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission to qualify for shareholders .
so , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely em@@ as@@ certain@@ ed .
special significance have the successful efforts from Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment objectives are to be seen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall facilit@@ ates Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 and has a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to exac@@ erb@@ ate itself as the world @-@ largest Er@@ ger@@ land China cast off the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ sized price dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties on import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects have risen in China .
unclear how sustain@@ ably the price @-@ up is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p was careful on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nating .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with a further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted not to exclude closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of well six percent less crude steel than in the previous year of the previous year , as the economic association was held on Friday .
after a brief increase in May the whole crowd went back to each other in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
the association expects an improved intake of the association in the coming months , thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing seniors well
the S@@ ingen has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for all her life : as a young girl she was in the school@@ choir , in the mag@@ ister@@ ium studies , she won the f@@ ach music , and today sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in an seniors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
at the same time , she is doing something good with her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Ludwig H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Re@@ aders &quot; liga .
most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular exchanges , the senior social contacts can take up and maintain social contacts .
what often solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to get to the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of co @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because in doing so , seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who require his lungs regularly , also in everyday life not so fast from the pu@@ ste .
even though it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz , of the German labour community of the senior citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz often watch that singing or hearing from songs with older people are awakened many memories often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ sk@@ il@@ ed people denied itself for long rec@@ umbent events .
in the singing , the head is also called a special achievement , explains L@@ enz .
focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practicing not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through the singing in the choir means h@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing by singing in the choir .
to show yourself : when I &apos;m a long time for something I will get better and more vigil@@ ant about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ king people , who doesn &apos;t listen to it when a sound is off ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors offer different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a seniors , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
you can also find many retirement cho@@ irs on the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the intervention .
who lust has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul feels good and has something fre@@ eing - that applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ aters on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the wh@@ istle from cat &apos;s kittens to adult animals .
to their surprise the che@@ wing also didn &apos;t let the males no cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ istrar of cat@@ bab@@ ys on the do@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens , who choose in great distress , how scientists from the university &apos;s university and medical university Hanover ( MH@@ H ) have found .
boys also react to the herds of kittens too - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the di@@ a@@ wing of less and strongly aroused young are either unacceptable or not of importance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the kittens must be distinguished with the urgency of their help .
there were a total of nine adult psychi@@ atr@@ ists and eight females from the animal management of the MH@@ H .
for example , they were played by little ones who were taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from both mother and si@@ blings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger kittens that were additionally highly raised .
the researchers consider their results despite the low sample of the sample .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not had their own offspring , reacted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding .
it turned faster to the loud@@ speaker when the person playing the very rainy kit@@ ten .
this ability may be innate or develop@@ ement with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have ever responded to , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby @-@ noises in the past .
also , some studies revealed that women have reacted sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ im Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warran@@ t had been en@@ acted against the ein@@ sty foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey a major football game takes place .
before Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ia of Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; Business as is called &quot; is announced .
already at the suspension of the ap@@ agreement after the crash trial in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hes are not com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup .
and it is not made in front of football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
it is therefore pres@@ umed to be accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup .
although the state is initially valid for 90 days until October , actually this has occurred to the lives of the most Turks but as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night@@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdogan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as all the land - split in followers and opponents of Erdogan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
there even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is beating for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sigh@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ ender &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly coming again to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its sporting value presented the Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , at all competition , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old had ended its first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ winners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appoint season for the record Master took a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the Pre@@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League differences the &quot; Lion &quot; also emerge early in the Europa League .
in the South by Li@@ g it reached only the rank of six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master visits , the game was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 years of seasonal figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher kö@@ nig was the basis of the 14th title .
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the end of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez signed below the contract and at the end of the coup d Gom@@ ez following the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays are not returning .
&quot; if Mario yet wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; he called the &quot; k@@ icker &quot; club executive of Fi@@ ore Or@@ man .
to do this , the falls should be ready to refrain from around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros estimated by Or@@ man : &quot; his salary in Florence we can not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these ath@@ lets still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
others over@@ took L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they struggle in Rio to medals .
the topic D@@ oping determines the headlines about the headlines with the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ er in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing spar@@ re her start @-@ law just before the games , was loos@@ ened at her start ( 100 meter chest ) mer@@ c@@ aded off and booked off .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a set @-@ up smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
when it was determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ubil@@ ate tower .
but there are many more athletes , who , despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio to start .
here &apos;s an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ e@@ ger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m into 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest p@@ inn@@ ed of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic @-@ champion and seven @-@ fold world championship in 2010 had to sit in six months after taking the pain of using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation I had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended Himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 has been tested the Olympics of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 , tested on the forbidden stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic popul@@ ate the s@@ wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four broad@@ casts this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Peking @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ e@@ ger and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , has been locked positively and 21 months in 2010 .
a means for penis enlargement could have been responsible , conf@@ essed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest growing man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ ff , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athlete was subsequently recognized as many medals .
so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after which testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing was established .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 was held back on account of a ruling majority of the International Sports Tribunal for the CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is placed in position two of the world rankings .

at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world @-@ world Championship , references to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement has been found , the sper@@ re of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell ill and ran from 13 July onwards .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Dar@@ łów@@ ko viol@@ ates - multiple dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand in contact with the woman , told the speaker of the State Department , Thomas Car@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
it has suffered tension and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
she was planning to return home for early September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in close contact with local authorities , so schn@@ ä@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in , there were two bombs on Thursday night in a swing quarter .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ age were killed and about 20 people have been wounded , including the Austrian Foreign Affairs , three Germans , three Netherlands and three Italians .
Friday early then two jumps were then high , according to the authorities another man was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the de@@ ton@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country explo@@ ded another bomb that killed a city .
the spr@@ int was according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police in the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were called on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast and several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it meant that it was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks are the same &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai criteria meth@@ yl@@ av@@ ee in the morning prior to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves in potential motiv@@ ations - it is probably the action of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for the bombar@@ d@@ ment of the local separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities have received secrecy about the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact date and places of time .
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
the police pointed out their officials in the whole country to enhance security around major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not direct against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ hungry bombar@@ ding , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends a consequence to his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security threat ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security guards and Muslim population , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) controlled for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were indicted a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution .
this sp@@ ill will also influence the military major influence over the years to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs would have been an attempt to sti@@ gate chaos , while the country move towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody civil distur@@ ban@@ ces , keeps itself good , the Kingdom repeatedly led to stability and order .
however , the military was also unable to get a grip on the military insur@@ er for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , a popular Hindu @-@ shr@@ ine was killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the visionary of the federal government for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial offices , the Constitutional Court in the federal government have placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locking points for efforts against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said constitutional Authority Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigration of other Islamic faith or from the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement well .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass @-@ migration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by exagger@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional complaint in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the government .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; the Constitutional Court said .
generally they are trying to address them with juven@@ ile language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not an advertising for your own thing .
propaganda should address the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
recently , there have been reports of several federal states on contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ T @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species were relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ for@@ - by certain persons , which are extrem@@ ist , alters its target and become so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is the reason whether such persons control the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the marked increase of ri@@ ghtful criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee revenues , Ma@@ inten@@ dents said , He would not speak about new rights in this context .
but we have found in recent years that it can give right @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further legal entities group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attack from other far @-@ right motives plan .
however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ d@@ ined about that many attacks on the account of people came , who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects in asylum seekers were not previously known as a criminal , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed against right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts at all , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left wing , which , however , have been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ cs or world records determine the headlines from the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te for the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers made of Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer shown in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a rep@@ lica of 48 seconds ended its prec@@ e@@ thing and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters .
but it was more of his not just sports figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is participating at the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special technical law from the international swimming pool .
this is being distributed to make swimming in inferior countries .
because in ae@@ dic@@ s most sports@@ men run , haw@@ ks wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the lap .
some media portra@@ y him as &quot; Ro@@ b of the whale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in announ@@ cing to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , it struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part .
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i had attracted media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in one pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fren@@ etic was fired at that time m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old met just eight months before Olympic and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

should it be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative of aging .
he then is driving in the holiday .

within its party the last one formed itself more and more resistance .

the res@@ ig@@ nations suddenly arrived - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K proclaimed that the chair of Chief Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more safe , the longer the success of it promised .

accidents - bus sli@@ pping into cro@@ issants in dit@@ ch : eight injured
at an accident of a travel agency with 43 Sen@@ iors as the passengers , we have been injured at the end of Thursday in Kar@@ pac@@ am@@ n ( Land@@ circle Aur@@ i ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered heavy injury , shared the police with .
the 66 years old rider of the bus company of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to indicate their information according to a hin@@ ge , partly on the co@@ aster .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman in the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six life@@ cars and a mort@@ ar car came to the accident at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the in@@ last travelers have been brought back from a scheduled bus to Kar@@ pac@@ a district Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators demanded the load @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to log in to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of wast@@ e@@ water will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schen@@ bach / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 44 . for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( until 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the san@@ itation fee will increase again at the latest when corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
after an over@@ sleep calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported to the approval of the budget by the country council , Kul@@ mb@@ ach has found that for these se@@ wage systems under@@ covers .
the market Kas@@ endorf is required for a legal basis to operate the systems cost .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from the world of trade , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to take deeper into the pur@@ se .
the increases increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Foundation Herbert Schmidt to the panel was necessary , a rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ation of charges for se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Excel or sub @-@ covers from the previous calendar period can be ruled out .
the company &apos;s grave increases were designed with all three se@@ wage systems to relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage @-@ inf@@ ring@@ ing , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters each year .
thus , due to the low distribution of distribution for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have considerable impact .
moreover , the se@@ wage @-@ water in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , during all three plants , they were not least observed during all three plants , not least because of their age and repair expenses .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt referred to that in the se@@ wage complex Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical aer@@ ation system due to an accident .
in the p@@ umping station , which had to be over@@ hau@@ led almost 20 years old convey@@ or systems , and in the pond situation , Lop@@ p had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ and@@ ular pond , the clone base and an additional ventilation possibility in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on these extraordinary applications came the advanced car@@ ving and maintenance costs , which are accordingly to be considered in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses clearly made that at the low se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expenses of operation and maintenance will be filled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
though , Supp@@ lement Schmidt , the Market community of great entertainment costs stayed at the se@@ wage systems during the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain prec@@ arious after view of stone houses in the long run , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the waste @-@ purpose Association of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these plants , because it deals with budget facilities .
Bulgaria booked up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive as a positive 0,@@ 2 % .
the annual average rate of last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the rate of inflation since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 , a price rose by the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,@@ 7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the lecture at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect as Asian caricature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ ti@@ bly towards breed .
with its filter tool , it enables sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities on such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be paintings by Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are unver@@ sion@@ ed , stand@@ ardis@@ ed tools , which generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ enium per day .
all the failures come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn up criticism in the past that they were accused of having the app &apos;s Black@@ face formal or white skin as beauty ideal prop@@ agate .
when this week proposed a filter for some U@@ sers , which gave them sli@@ ps , false teeth and so@@ aked wool , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ats - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy had a major problem that the company has engaged with diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company provided an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a caricature of Asian .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced racism , rec@@ alled the filter to hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail I wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American artificial student whose T@@ we@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ tful and hard to say . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ top of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not dr@@ astic , but that the yellow head was drawn into the throwing extre@@ mes .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tren@@ ches .
the American culture seems to be involved in an un@@ ending dense and integr@@ ational approach , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in the race than their older opponents - could possibly expect to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture generated , that for a user is offen@@ ded , &quot; so it is much harder that such matters remain un@@ noticed when it was in the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineer as a medium to delete their sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a phone interview , she said that r@@ ind @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the inclusion of sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no number of representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they said such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin paints which work there , but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Sn@@ ap@@ chat , the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set up a personnel responsible to meet its population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said that she is closed to her sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military warfare ( ISIS &apos; intelligence information ) notes at the Committee of Congress
military @-@ related members of the United States Central Command changed secondary information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual states on site , signed an investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Committee , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ macht , reported of great dis@@ content among Central Command secret officials who reported how they changed their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News intelligence information , which were typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren , recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual states on site and were consistently reported by analyses of other news services , &quot; commented a newspaper article .
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , is firm .
the man@@ ag@@ erial mistake in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report features detailed @-@ lasting problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct reference to that government &apos;s tips given to Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to their supervis@@ ors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of the year 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were considerably more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ try could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them was concerned that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supple@@ mented by more detailed findings while investig@@ ating investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ com reports are underway by the inspec@@ tor of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly reduced process for the creation of thoughtful aler@@ ts to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest priority of democr@@ at in the com@@ posi@@ bility , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hesit@@ ated the publication of following reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave some space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats have given no evidence on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ com analy@@ st on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August the New York Times reported by investigations by the prosec@@ utor of the Pentagon , which were added to complaints by Cent@@ com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment at the Congress while investig@@ ators are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also showed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes thoroughly have diver@@ ting opinions regarding interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Defense Department welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues in national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investigations have made feedback on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ag@@ grav@@ itation of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ isms regarding the hearing information about the Islamic State remind of intermediate cases of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , who looked at the recommendations of many analysts on the recommendations of many analysts on the recommendations of many analysts on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate Government notes that contrary to the statements made by the government regulations against the terrorist group , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went in retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA wins four @-@ fourth match in the Feld@@ ho@@ ckey of the Women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that won US American with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember this ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , this does not know : the American people lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal to their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ plat@@ former will take a little longer from the path that will lead the other group .
as usual the game on Saturday may go out , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tices with their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ d@@ ger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became the National Training of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the kay@@ ak .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was named , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of national teams , and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ st@@ ling can be carried out completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back manual from the Middle East .
India had gone without victory in the tournament without victory , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , up to B@@ am the game in their hands .
she carried a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate for the American to get a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which had previously had a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge on Saturday from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly evolving and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid season between competition and quest .
it is as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el himself would be a burning rod , which is used by wr@@ ist@@ ings to the tur@@ ers to the tri@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ gend@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le c@@ los to listen .
and then there is log@@ on Do@@ ol@@ ey .
do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with gr@@ assy area , would certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , g@@ ymn@@ ast or even fen@@ nel .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline .
the Olympic Fl@@ ame does not illuminated any event equally .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air p@@ istol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest and may rule it for a long time .
but if I should do humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been a Olympic event already since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney its debut , it became the last 16 years so spar@@ ely perceived that many people had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in a trampoline and had a athletes until 2012 has managed it to the end @-@ day .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain outdoor swimming char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ resolved ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the most suitable for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sal@@ v@@ est enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ onic tre@@ mb@@ ling of its never ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging conqu@@ ers jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ kes and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are judged as the official Olympi@@ as for the execution , level of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ eight athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists have to go ahead in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and down , down and down in the playground .
they chase not only the c@@ ell@@ in@@ ia or the out@@ wall , but also another ero@@ sion target : that of the world or the Olympi@@ are@@ kor@@ ds .
the targeted endeavor is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ ly - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator at tears .
but it is also what I myself feel when looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the o@@ af @-@ jum@@ per is above .
moving forward is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then gradually down , then effort@@ less again .
there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no curved into the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s such Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and end @-@ round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC is radi@@ ating the narro@@ wer as part of a afternoon @-@ area on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil .
if the level of consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ li@@ zation and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently opened according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to breathe fresh fans .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters , the political changes in Ethiopia calls for violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that thousands of prot@@ esters during cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed at s@@ uss@@ ani .
is Ethiopia exactly going to come together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the strongest countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the last months protests against the government f@@ lowed the country and expanded in more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week thousands of people plung@@ ed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses raised that polic@@ emen s@@ laugh@@ tered and killed on un@@ armed demonstrators .
in circulation , videos about the protests that are likely to show themselves from the last or the beginning of this year , show how safety men were forced to strike young people , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now asking for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the notice pace .
its infrastructure dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia has been anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have repeatedly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , whereas disper@@ ses were effectively sil@@ enced .
many have been sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you want to sup@@ press people and have no other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ies .
all the youth are prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground use up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a extended election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border into Eritrea is rising ; a struggle for these jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which were more or less enforced in recent years , will benefit the turbul@@ ence and become re@@ ar@@ ming again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of which are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , which is at regular intervals , especially in protests , does many people still communicate via Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered themselves to protest .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from e@@ dic@@ s mainly to Christian floods , in politics and economics , while they are exploited by the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ lands .
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ e@@ chu , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former wine leader , was until his death a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in the year 2012 17 years Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who was able to think corners .
analysts are saying that he was particularly gr@@ asp@@ ed to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special officers to deal with opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ careful reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ians , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st declare that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time , that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to the declarations of Analy@@ tiker seemingly , were decei@@ ved by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly .
the development experts of the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ chief of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it occupies a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month of the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is always more complicated in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests per@@ ished the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although they recently rus@@ hed to have closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want to bring his allies in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buzz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by announ@@ cing that his multiple repe@@ aled asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fying statement made new questions about the communications skills of the presidential election of the Republi@@ can public@@ ans whether he would be able to communicate and communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his collaborators who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain his peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all .
having made the hint at a election event on Wednesday night , Mr. Tr@@ ump drew back in regards to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning t@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt MEP , Hu@@ gh He@@ witt wanted to help to weak@@ en the statement by simply reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential election did not want to know anything of it .
the last storm of the critic@@ isms pointed out to Mr. Tr@@ ump when he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign due to fin@@ alisation of the survey values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this subject again .
on Twitter followers he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ ics emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be taken , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also think it &apos;s cle@@ verly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even an addition to its tone as its survey values move further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who has been published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a large advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal contribut@@ ors to the irregular situation to stand unto him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ ents , has given great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani so he was asked to verify the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back but@@ cher , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved out the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , served in Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister , it allowed IS to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and raised them to come back on each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he under@@ mines the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can not do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats have spot@@ ted above Mr. Tr@@ umps as only a further proof that he may be in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once distributed over the price from the market , café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bedford Avenue Lad@@ in Front has been sup@@ pressed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sell soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people en@@ visi@@ oned it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ abs wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new finding .
a newly animated café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of ancient cafes , owners and managers of the new café .
he began to work in Ver@@ b 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same Distri@@ but@@ or for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu you are standing sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ cks such as cap@@ ers and su@@ ble@@ ed oni@@ ons .
there are natur@@ als .
the café serves no beer , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez announced that he had noticed a short stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed aside through awards from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after being pulled back to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after having closed the verb , she gave a while the coffee leg , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that there was coffee and on the culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks another coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb .
he went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal getting its usual order , but sometimes he changes its Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no lo@@ osing about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie actually offered a special soap to produce coffee with the cold coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has imagined it to make her coming soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has more advantages .
a few ju@@ icer local wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands into a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular customer , and said that he was destroyed in the ground as the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the beg@@ ging of the local and the customer felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to craw@@ l up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtles .
its menu on this day was something more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ ums pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zie@@ gel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zie@@ gel@@ man told her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; that will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ apped snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store for since the crash crash in 1929 .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
as the Reporter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this was the couple for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man .
there was crude bread , liver cheese and sweet bread .
they were made of an ingredient and somewhat cheap , which swal@@ lowed the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ded for male field workers and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square meal &quot; draws the way in which the country left with it no longer to be the ar@@ tery land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , tense topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense , the new bud@@ get@@ fulness : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ tions have been reported to stap@@ le food , the water wool as &quot; wonderful type , food @-@ remains rein@@ vigor@@ ous , &quot; because Kö@@ che un@@ appe@@ aled ingredients could hide under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ ons .
meat that has been the center of the American cuisine for years became a rarely ser@@ fourth luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutrient @-@ satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a brick made of this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ man goes on : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , we drove appliances - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
in order to publish recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget@@ ary women and the challenge , pamp@@ as , as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square meal &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Food @-@ attitude .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ in @-@ kitchen of his kitchen , he spec@@ ulate like the millions @-@ old man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ cooked meal and took a smo@@ king .
he was delightful un@@ realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ anor had prompted him to prepare a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the civil servant with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt led that the White House revealed the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most common preparations . &quot;
many of the species out of the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said goat , and how science has been applied to food .
the couple gave better understood the eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in writing - for example how they couldn &apos;t throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind@@ beut@@ ler .
after the plates were ev@@ acu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they pulled them and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt ate at noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that there was a nasty trick to give recipes a chic name .
there were no curved Sah@@ ne , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon into the fence , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted no bad .
Co@@ e took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a can @-@ do @-@ bud@@ ge@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few har@@ dened wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died at a facade attack on the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , who has saved the lives according to picture newspaper so far under 6@@ 0.000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers are putting their own life to play in order to educate people from bom@@ bed houses and to help their first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil fire that shows it in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a house , he went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the shining symbol@@ ism in the atro@@ city of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said loud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar herself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have k@@ ic@@ ked four faç@@ ades over the Al@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine .
one woman and two children died , seven men suffer from breathing difficulty .
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play , &quot; the image cited its last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ ra is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually only come to the surface in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the ship .
he was born 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland has only been born with 150 years of age .
very leis@@ ur@@ ely flo@@ ats of Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic on the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average just 1.@@ 220 feet wide .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds up to 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ ust with this maximum speed .
this shaped lifestyle , however , seems to be a pan@@ acea of a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; madness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein , commented by the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for wh@@ irl@@ pools .
although suspected of the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already for a long time that Greenland will be st@@ one@@ age .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland is hard to observe , finally they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the sk@@ inn@@ ed coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter only in winter .
about the lifestyles of Greenland researchers know accordingly little .
her tim@@ es@@ pent@@ emp@@ o measure her when she re@@ treats six animals with a station of Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
loot make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the aw@@ bone of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly they chase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look Kad@@ aver , which fell down from higher layers to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a subsi@@ dy from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the ruler of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye @-@ lens already occurs in front of the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins that contain , and are not renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the liner .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons attempts with larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
with 220 centi@@ meters length third @-@ term animal , the lin@@ sen@@ ators submitted a small surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lin@@ kers , against the other hand , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 centi@@ meters long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k could be even 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland females only then got offspring when they are longer than four metres , was well @-@ known .
now , the researchers at length could be assigned an age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 15@@ 6 years was determined , Greenland can become apparent at least one and a half centuries of time .
also this is likely to be a world record for wh@@ irl@@ pools .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence .
even the previous record @-@ hand , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland wal , in whose bac@@ on at the N@@ aking a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on lace , was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there is often the body of the animals living there on savings .
so they mature a bit later - and age slower .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal gives heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram Eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should rather invest on its resources in a long life .
background in double pack
with topics around the building , the common@@ place has focused on the recent meeting in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated caravan can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ ing and lock@@ smith , and the applications for measurement could be made available , the sale of land pieces in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ ets track &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) to interested parties no longer in the way .
the Joint Council is convinced that the b@@ lob@@ ster in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and stock@@ ings seniors equally attract .
as it was called , construction permits can report immediately in the town hall with the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the common@@ place in its September session .
in order to also address requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial companies , coupled with the creation of jobs , the common@@ place decided to re @-@ change the surface area in parts of this year in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of sub @-@ time expos@@ ures , there is already been extended business area around two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city &apos;s Main Event therefore has the best opportunity to go to Paris , Dublin and Luxemburg , to attract the best opportunities from London to move jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , Head of Kompetenz@@ fel@@ ds markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial transactions will continue to run from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , it has until now enough approval in the UK .
that is why large US banks use .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main in five years .
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is speaking of responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is indeed a large fund industry , cutting but even as Dublin in the infrastructure worse off .
thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
furthermore , the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not that easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands .
the addition to the Seine are also the rents for first @-@ class commercial properties by 50 per cent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the business consultancy , Merc@@ er stood at Square 7 , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin at place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ xit the most important financial center in Europe , my German expl@@ orer .

a US @-@ minister@@ ing decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. claims to be issued on the refund of the legal costs , resulting from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

from the USA supported troops say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
from the USA supported troops have conquered full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stems from the moving of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , currently the city .
they released more than 2,000 civilians who were held at fighters as host@@ ages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ ing shared with the D@@ KS Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters .

clinics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton concluded its tax return for 2015 , which was approved for the presidential election of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 the Clin@@ ics USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton had generated an income of USD 3 million from the publisher of Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ics &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declaration of the past ten years .
you paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ics Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was known in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ab@@ rupt contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind false exc@@ uses and rep@@ atri@@ ate in regards to his recent promises to publish its tax declaration .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential elections to publish their tax declaration , although it is no obligation to deal with law because of this .
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for its denial a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics election campaigns in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in terms of publication of the presidential election of the Democratic community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the control tests are not completed .
numerous critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential election of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already noted that its ref@@ usal sp@@ ills issues concerning assets , its donations for charitable organisations , his business@@ men and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already launched on the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls for its tax return to publish .
on Thursday she spoke also during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do that which has done any other presidential elections in recent decades and to publish its tax declaration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid any or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a commercial journalist in the New York Times on Friday a number of tax lawyer and tax advis@@ ers , which might still be the case .
federal control has become an issue in the electoral campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets that would make sure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
during a campaign campa@@ igning for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ alo , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrie@@ con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump for a meeting to exchange their control .
Buff@@ o said he was also subjected to the IR@@ S as well and p@@ umping &quot; fear &quot; against the voters and not before tax authorities .
clinics &apos;s campaign has published tax return by 2007 to 2007 .
the clinics that are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of Clin@@ ics from 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income than wages , unlike most of all Americans .
its chief Gel@@ dan@@ ts was a cost @-@ effective index funds from which the Clin@@ ics dividend and revenue of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 failed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works @-@ ham@@ pers promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
natural scor@@ er in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with chi@@ li@@ ds .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already been the idea for years ago , together with the US nature protection , has been trained to employ volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ an@@ as , using a non@@ violent sliding method to protect their homes and harvest without inj@@ ure animals .
previously , many sc@@ iss@@ ors have used to defend himself .
Friday is a phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we could observe inside these communities a change of their attitude , whereby they can hold much more confidence that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without having the eleph@@ ants to harm , &quot; expressed the manager of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a Communication .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ate of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not isolated , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

however , the motion for the new building of a sales ski driver at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer near the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine , however , refused to with@@ stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new business operators , but at this location in the exp@@ on@@ ized location on the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish choreo@@ grapher Berlin Hotel , because Israeli re@@ election was removed from &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director , with Jewish roots , unle@@ ashed a media watch , after betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed Israeli pre @-@ election since it was requested by Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; wrote his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how about 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ ved him , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , del@@ ste in the director still more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ commerce called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has ar@@ isen in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident made a pretty large response to the internet where people called the whole scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some underestimated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the cl@@ assy cour@@ ge , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly drew all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; by Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record in the fast @-@ down list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

students arrived in Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police replaced Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstrators .
the difficulties began , when police officers tried to apply the students , what led to the police with rubber @-@ stories and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran , in the annual sales increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly on businesses in the country , distributed to the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another trade @-@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade agreements between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2015 rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and contributed $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the trade swing was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year the Russian foreign representatives had around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily for travel , an Iranian citizen .
moreover , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
you could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , said , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the vineyard Bas@@ ach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna was on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were accomplished .
in order to bridge the time until the next novels from all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the first two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ten@@ ford St. Anna decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges was checked and it was finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ city of Freiburg , where in this year the Holy Year of Our Lady opened the mercy of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , which was offered a special pilgrimage destination .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ it err@@ s gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Sk@@ inner rac@@ ted last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow , took the voice of the governor , who had made his country@@ men Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend as he stor@@ med home to get a victory of the favour@@ ites in New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ medals .
they repeated the trick after they took part in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the back@@ packs of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the employee Jamie Staff .
they did this on time as a sign @-@ up .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed , when they saw potential in the car@@ rots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who continued four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ s - and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fication round a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the footh@@ ills of the New Zeal@@ ots in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategic change made a great deal of transformation to slow down the pace in a higher course to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on when they went on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have placed a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde , and the World Champion has been defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der gave , that after a weak start , he clearly fell off the train .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals .
this time there was no such problem with such a super@@ lative victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer for our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the area of possible that he won Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a explo@@ iters of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the em@@ blem of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely , alone to gain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals he should be defeated by the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ ber@@ glass , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the destination .
the world record , which won in London gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins and Security .
he had disputed himself with defend@@ ant before the qualification as he set up function@@ aries to measure its height .
in the proportionate women &apos;s competition , the morning continues and finished , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Trot@@ t , Joanna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ pal , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ved of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world cold season in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself on its strong railway track to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a s@@ ling of medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were down@@ right .
Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ment and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then , as the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which at the perfect moment has reached its peak , repeated again .
future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of energy consumption
the future of the aluminum mel@@ tdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - stand on the game , since the plant operators will announce the energy supplier , and therefore will raise all the delivery contracts , as the supplier &apos;s energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a Sub@@ si@@ diary set for 20 years is scheduled in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland stand at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be jeop@@ ardis@@ ed at a closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consumed .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting shop , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risk a closing .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large di@@ ec@@ lip@@ se with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners are going to announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will keep minor proportions .
&quot; AG@@ L is assumed that the plant in Portland will continue to operate in Portland , which means more physical demand for electricity through the melting shop , &quot; shared the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to indicate that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 months notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L is assuming that the agreements will contribute to the revenue in the fiscal year 17 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential impact on the earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the progn@@ oses of strong schedul@@ ing markets for wholesale travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the contracts is already written in his annual ab@@ ject in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate or to make the power supply to the melting shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not imp@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it has concluded an 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been in force from November this year , even though it is still a statement found why it has res@@ igned by the contract .
analy@@ st warn thanks to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland m@@ elt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
by referring to the statements made by the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen was said that Portland every year , some 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets this would not be good , &quot; he said .

K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers said to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ... or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ( with the exception of the problem sei@@ zur@@ es Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they end the cover of their sister and that with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the cl@@ ums@@ y act almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s dispatch ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; You were having forgotten that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon animation on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 am ) , but Kris had to take care of her other girl somehow in this publicity .
with a view to the Sep@@ em@@ ber@@ ing of Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
K@@ end@@ alls great S@@ ister Kim likes what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , beaten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s magazine is a league for itself .
the Sep@@ harv@@ issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resembles rather a picture band than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling bear@@ ers 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ er@@ ly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine appeared before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Mod@@ els who are celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ pri@@ ze@@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebrities are not related to the famous people or Reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good snack @-@ chat video ( even if all of them apply to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success any .
with its reality @-@ TV @-@ history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the first Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and their colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings che@@ ers again high , as the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the mis@@ grace seems to advance at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of Vo@@ gue .
in the tru@@ est sense of the word , it is a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
common areas of community centers indicate 16@@ 0.000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ ary fig@@ s are rejected annually by the common institutions in the country , while the industry has placed on the effects of further intermediate cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ oc@@ ations and similar assistance - in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ hau@@ led , make themselves ready for further cuts .
in June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the community detention centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint centres revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the capital of the community centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and impressive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have just un@@ just released - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means thousands of helpl@@ ess@@ ant people from Queensland to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the general At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle cuts promptly , so people can get help they need in legal problems .
last year the government ministers fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ tive campaign charged with employee supposedly weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indicted for alleged in@@ activity after her was informed that their struggle for North Carolina on February in February had directed an arms weapon to an employee , while in February they were travelling in a je@@ ep .
the incident was described in a bill that was submitted by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave to having been waiting for months , that the matter would be governed internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled out a p@@ istol , put his right foref@@ inger on the withdrawal , and threw the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compl@@ ained on the local and regional fight @-@ line , B@@ ordin@@ i determined that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip , he gave in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be folded to cause damage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; called B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment comes out only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential election , as he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ ro@@ weapon @-@ owner and arms @-@ friends should take action when his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge should appoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was clear that media had torn away his words from the context and that he would not lead to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint asks damage to the campaign for the injury of due di@@ ligence duty and Philip because of bodily injury and ab@@ iding mental damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ diction in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip did not fail .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , announces that Phillip is no longer employee of the campaign .
on calls in his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been responded .
the Republi@@ can Presidential Deb@@ ate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the SPD &apos;s vote and CD@@ U are characterized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this hon@@ ors representative of opinion of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government , in the north , just under further rule , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good opportunities to continue the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD desc@@ ended from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party is reduced only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ for@@ es .
the Left Opposition to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens are hesit@@ ant , despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country with 3 percent .
according to the Berlin representative of the survey , the SPD survey was only 23 percent in survey ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 percent .
it is still facing the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to the Pir@@ ates against it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market a 20 years ago .
the successor today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite a knock .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight Me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would be present today for about two people with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the stores - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow stem from the quarry of the inter@@ net@@ age .
however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , albeit agon@@ izing slowly .
a paper@@ board was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked similar to a laptop .
then there is a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud , the price was 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator was going to become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wound .
today we dominate the market today , all of them later came to Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday .
2015 has been almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1,@@ 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone are 5@@ 55 million copies .
global sales with the devices is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the pay@@ able app provider and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has now been developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs , on the Mac @-@ World , announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet @-@ communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
the victory of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had to see .
it finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the strings now have Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung .
a smartphone is a matter of course after its invention , 20 years after its invention .
as a cut , every German now looks at its mobile phone for 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all the smartphone , the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only take place in our local municipalities and throughout London but also to bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country .
for me that was the greatest attraction He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this by creating new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already deliver 10,000 new apprentices to create more than 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will show us on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to rec@@ ede , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in swe@@ ating growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequented drives in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s enlargement will also be one .
it is time that we will steer this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw and thereby create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for ad block . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online money , according to one of the software companies , attempts to avoid using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block signs on its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , in which it hur@@ ts that users could update their filters in the program to block any advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the co@@ ding regarding its advertising display to display it ad lo@@ osen up the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to ag@@ grav@@ ate it .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ fight between the coming open source community and the h@@ ows have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world @-@ largest company in social media has settled into the battle is a strong clu@@ sion for how worrying ad lo@@ osen for the industry has become .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe approximately 200 million people , use ad lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand @-@ value 84 percent of the advertising revenues generated by fac@@ ebooks .
the company has shown it on desktop PCs aside , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , distributed a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook will be the investment of such a pac@@ em@@ aker as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; ad prize pool &quot; to get the people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ pin new filters would be worrying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead concentrated on the developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway over@@ drive
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are witnesses to witness after a woman was over@@ riding in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in Cant@@ on Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that an Schweizer@@ hof in the age of 49 years , carried out by several vehicles , including a truck , would have to kill themselves .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard yet , but some have not yet been identified , the police , which , as well as every witness of the incident , calls for itself to report .
it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logistical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Trib@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something which the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the busy killing was acqu@@ itted on after they had a man over@@ ride and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 was near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court notes that the police officers had responded to an emergency way -- to a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ ese@@ en situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the region of Morges , should report the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once more hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at the NASA developed a model to discover the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once belonged to a similar conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow @-@ turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ @-@ like atmosphere and yet progres@@ sed slowly .
the model also illuminated the Top@@ ographie from the early Venus .
the planet presumably referred to more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and be protective against more intense ar@@ ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in der G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ ires the slow @-@ turn of Venus your daily site of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures , some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution that was suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- has been exposed as much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
her oceans , and her water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy moves back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and identification , &quot; the fifty @-@ year @-@ old Roy did in an opinion .
I &apos;ve learned a lot over the summer and much thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization .
he also has to have a co @-@ determination right in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who accused Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick now informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association to 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in any of the last few years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ leum workers take talks again , strike a strike
the labour struggles for the remuner@@ ation for Nord@@ sea Oil workers are exposed , while all the parties put together for a new conversation at the table , they said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the African field service provider - Wood Group has been carried out spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea carried out by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold out some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , beginning next year to start the problems again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their final strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has abbrevi@@ ated the R@@ ats to its contrasts within the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the ratings of the company follows a 10 @-@ year decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the enterprise gives the space required to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alise its business activities as a result of his Meg@@ at@@ reunion with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , a economic situation , which had to rely on the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Parliam@@ entary member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour forces which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion on expenditure for new projects in North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation of stars in the star@@ ches of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler World War II , astronom@@ ers helped to collect the full catalogue of rotation among the stars of the star@@ ry P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the Astronom@@ y to rot@@ ate the stars in the star@@ ry and rot@@ ate at different edges , as well as in which context the rotation periods are with the planet development .
&quot; we hope that through the same of our results , we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s inf@@ rar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ges of the P@@ lei@@ ades are 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation who were born around 125 million years ago , are now being able to reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning on the fastest .
at peak rates , these str@@ aps come across a large amount of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is aging , his rotation begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an recognizable star @-@ fle@@ cks -- how sun @-@ fle@@ cks --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more and more stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slowly pi@@ rou@@ ters turn than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star@@ ches of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal kos@@ her laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the star@@ ges of the Ple@@ j@@ adas offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much to hear about what we want to learn more about how , W@@ ann and why stars are slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the ple@@ ads which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star steps out
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will be held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; stated that 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players in the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract made him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as players paid it Rodri@@ guez long time with performance back .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed several mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
however , into the glory of the b@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was introduced between 2001 and 2003 to have forbidden stero@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to completion in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis scandal .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspected , for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida Pro@@ mot@@ ing resources .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days were not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; added Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
any@@ how Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az and with the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate Hudson River , sympathy of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the trailer for the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing accidents
he wi@@ pes : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ ing@@ es .
a blur@@ red athlete had almost become a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases the Olympic Games became known in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ed in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Viol@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of any case @-@ critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests .
in Chen past Sunday , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de had been proven in the last Sunday , used as a mas@@ tic means for dop@@ ing sub@@ instances .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed the expul@@ sion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze medals .
on Friday he would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and has requested a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the restoration of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio d@@ oo@@ ed the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance for the blood @-@ dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ nova was uncovered , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is supposed to have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w approached he immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bul@@ gars are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , for example , all weight @-@ the@@ bers may not take part in the chronic @-@ wearing nation in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known for the London Olympics at the class until 85 kg has been tested positive as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before on the an@@ abolic stero@@ oid N@@ and@@ lon .
both will deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ nova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception because systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the L@@ um@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the former settlements in China had also ensured a fierce debate between athletes .
so with the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ e@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also the centre of a debate with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively in the Chinese champi@@ onships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ alog@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de uni@@ ma@@ iled h@@ ackers you ran@@ som
programmers of Inf@@ ection @-@ Mal@@ ware are currently targe@@ ting companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware defense specialist , under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partially repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ ma@@ c software .
in Germany about 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims paid ready by the perpetrators demanded to use the challenged systems and data to be used again .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ ma@@ c software according to the observations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack on company networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are successful there , if the potential to pres@@ cri@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dele@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is significantly higher than in private users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of pollutants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e programs were still designed to send publicity .
then discovered the perpetrators of the pres@@ sors .
only were private users the target , but the change to company attacks was start@@ ling quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a victim , it seeks specific files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cr@@ yp@@ s Bit@@ coin .
but where private users stand the personal photo database on the game , it goes for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 per cent of the affected German firms surv@@ eyed over Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to stop operations completely inter@@ rup@@ ting , in case of a case humans were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals are victims of attack , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health ak@@ ac@@ utely .
&quot; we say the victims always : paying not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators .
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Sec@@ ure examined the commercial @-@ conquest areas and the contact with black@@ mail@@ ings and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat on how to pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites or en@@ code free example files .
and will private merchants dis@@ sol@@ ves to payments of a few hundred euros , companies must pay partly tough and 5 digit numbers to withdraw their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti@@ virus provider of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
most likely , however , that it is three or four persons .
the programmers sell their pollutants in form of a software building to the actual black@@ board .
the previous Mal@@ ware kits were created by making the mal@@ ware even , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that minor configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ ins are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is per billing .
&quot; commonly asked the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known with many companies that make their data better secure .
over 50 percent of companies operating in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on how to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
consequently , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful creation , the perpetr@@ ator will instead be explained with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage potential according to type of data is still much higher than before .
the perpetrators will continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con showed the strict security expl@@ orer how they could get connected with the Internet of connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a dist@@ res@@ sed heating could certainly be a ran@@ som of so many victims .
if the perpetr@@ ator then , instead of the heating in the future , block the whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday du@@ sty
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will packing everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty clear , but the HR @-@ V , which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit top is down there .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on top @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l in case of cl@@ oned back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seating areas of the spine can be high @-@ cl@@ apping and thus offer storage space , which is up from the floor up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk @-@ room can be loaded well , but the charger with 650 mm is a little higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque range of up to 300 N@@ m in wide range areas very powerful .
but he is likely to do something quieter .
the day @-@ to @-@ day consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
among the security systems is the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ king assistant ( works up to the pace of 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the principle assistant .
the coll@@ isions are irrit@@ ated sometimes , because it has been evaluated in the ran@@ ging many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the tel@@ esc@@ ope .
and the intelligent tem@@ e@@ al regul@@ ator respon@@ ds to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t in need of the speed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are under arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
who does not want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday du@@ sty car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ fall on air @-@ making bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air @-@ line .
because a liability is conceivable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , the Upper National Court of Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken with the fall of a knee injury .
but the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a general risk of risk , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
sick holiday@@ makers will only receive money after their trip , if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but that is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the tra@@ ded case , a family was severe in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
your illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective waste position , which allegedly inf@@ lic@@ ted the sea water .
the family was the view that the journey had been faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained to the organis@@ ers .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ lage was in fact def@@ ective .
the Organ@@ izer is just before the departure of the Pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not hurt his information duties , so the judgment .
especially since in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the disorder of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with each other - belong to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the victims of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be bes@@ po@@ ised and decided to react at the same time .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ator with hate and separation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we will not give the terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if criminal offen@@ ders had to leave the country , but increase security and strength even the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the Bundest@@ ags 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ el strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size of medium over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon will be re@@ distributed so that , above all , the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated .
the last much discussed sweat @-@ light for doctors should be met by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères in words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with medical profession like the haz@@ ard of citizens , he said with a view of mental abnormalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds better social support for necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in the pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to use the deployment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to raising security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against shareholder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a ear @-@ maker for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and an abolition of double nationality .
a general ban on whol@@ eness of authority he is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
one cannot for@@ bid everything which one re@@ jects , and I reject the carrying out of the Bur@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talking about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the Minister before he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorism Pact .

better transport flow on the Motor@@ way br@@ inger
it is regularly st@@ amped on the byp@@ ass road - here is a picture of November .
but that shall change : the distor@@ tion is to be prolonged .
this is good news for all the motor@@ cyclists who are in professional traffic on the ambient way every night in St@@ au , when they ride over the motorway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the descent V@@ ale Road the right track by 700 meters .
drivers can fly right from the Hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic shares early on , whereby the total @-@ term procedure is improved on the multiple @-@ road section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district court of Münster @-@ West .
the driving distance on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days extends from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ gans and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ clock on the B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ eler .
from here the traffic is guided only one @-@ lane on the highway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations made that the bridge does no longer have the necessary hydro@@ power to add above all the heavy traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will last , the responsible state of state can not say .
however , it is expected to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official remainder of it up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the judiciary , the country is deliberately chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
the traffic is on Tuesday and on Wednesday in lane construction site .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are planning a music project now .
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The Un@@ visible House &quot; of the Young The@@ ater Münster .
in the context of the &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ates &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging at the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes , the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German .
thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ zen@@ ry images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the process of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ ater Münster .
the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ asi@@ us Wes@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ yer , and the young theatre will work together within the upcoming season as part of a musical the@@ ater@@ al project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years have the opportunity to visit professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of plays and theatri@@ cal language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; goes on .
in the face of the increasing refugee numbers the association is charged with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ry : hope for we@@ ather@@ ing
the weather has made the star@@ tu@@ bs Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the South@@ west of Germany at night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many star@@ tu@@ bs in the sky .
the star@@ tu@@ ps are Per@@ sei@@ zes , which belong to the fastest star sou@@ ks with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast .
relaxing Night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you eat etern@@ ally , at night you are awake hours of hours , in the morning there is no longer to think about sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about one quarter of adult in@@ gestion and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than rest@@ ful .
how are sleeping problems or in@@ som@@ ing disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be many causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Board member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ es and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what one sees among them is , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y @-@ compul@@ sive disorder .
precisely that all sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ fying or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Vor@@ board member in the German Haus@@ dentist association with practice in Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind bed@@ bugs ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it can organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that different factors depres@@ sing each other .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie bad , waking up every two to three hours and begins to aw@@ ning on , about everyday problems and worries , gives We@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should we talk to sleep in@@ som@@ ing to your doctor ?
those who have not sleep well over a month of a month at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised by the day should go to the doctor , says We@@ e@@ ß .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ sett@@ ling , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches .
to allevi@@ ate the disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , among other things , changes in behaviour , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classical sle@@ y pills can be used only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - question .
in Germany there is hardly any nur@@ tured medical doctors in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should contact the primary doctor first , says We@@ e@@ ß .
it can be clear with examinations whether the problems have a bodily cause .
who should be in the sleeping laboratory , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleeping laboratory , medical diagnosis , for example in snoring with air@@ ways , in case of disease @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ e@@ al disorder , declared fi@@ erc@@ ing .
actually , it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not ask a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after sale one goes to his normal time into bed .
besides the electro@@ des in the body , one has a nose @-@ gog@@ gles , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling .
how can the problems cope with the problems ?

what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler posed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time at the Short Film Championships in Doha and at the same time presented its first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler posed on Facebook in front of his or her criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ e@@ ger gets 20,000 € premi@@ ums and a jun@@ k full of 150@@ ,000 € should be surprised by no one over missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on his Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls is very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries which do not promote a lot and do not see or even do it on the issue of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have had been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries as well .

airport : Ban@@ de of bags arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the Airport Düsseldorf
civilian rap@@ aths of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrived on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ver@@ de@@ ans had committed as a gang of several pick@@ pockets and bags .
at 9@@ 30 clock civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport Düsseldorf was once again known as a gang that was well @-@ known of the polic@@ emen of past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences in the mid @-@ July of this year , and were very professional and were very professional .
the specialists in the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can cut the seal , who had entered the works of crimes against Germany , four actions .
they had been a total of more than 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lenses , meanwhile with a rest of the cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight , but the police count them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one comes along the slots , a fres@@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the facade of a gray house somebody has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a li@@ d@@ l which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rentals are expected here .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the responsible real estate company , Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be prefer@@ ed with burning cars in recent weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rented agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel had repeatedly called for a hard action of police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmie@@ de , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled out the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , lock@@ out parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown domestic owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later the police and builders under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road looks peaceful : parents walk with children stro@@ lling around with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others entertained Pre@@ m Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a basic school and kinder@@ gartens .
left force is not the main city of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in the Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who draws here three children , above all from the police site .
with the inhabitants of domestic projects they share the care of rising rents and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a p@@ sy , which partly prov@@ okes Poli@@ ze@@ isch@@ utz on the left hand side .
the dit@@ ch , used by the Berlin cour@@ sen@@ ator and the police between domestic and their neighbours , does not appear as obviously .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today also has a low average of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
dwell@@ ings and the native residential projects have long been part of Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied in the former DDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under large police kill@@ ings in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : the inhabitants of the GDR today share their inhabitants .
this also noticeable in the rents since 2009 , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in char@@ ted discs or freshly squee@@ zed fac@@ ades which have been car@@ ded with paint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; centre @-@ based violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make the facts that tend to meet newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a house house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for the rule of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which they have not been determined .
the famous burning cars also give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal case , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed .
for this reason , it was also so important that the inhabitants will return their street : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly inv@@ aded the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabit@@ ant like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take away : through spot@@ lessly new@@ buildings in former construction pieces that sup@@ press the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um apartments which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if one never list@@ ens to somebody ?
so on all sides frustration a , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for sugar , which fre@@ t about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene were belonged to the Kiev .
who comes from , should be aware - just like someone who is in a pub that can complain bad about noise .
all persons just asked with names names have asked not to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee @-@ officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ os supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is still mis@@ leading .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ gh wool , who has above all a problem .
for example , some - less ridicul@@ es , rather than on the multitude of desire , are pur@@ pose@@ ful - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
we were looking for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a hurry Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
first of all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes , as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent position in the period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ our@@ - and full @-@ time actors supported .
there are large and minor problems , organisational , human and inter@@ personal problems .
soon there are new containers in the washing road
a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the connecting host@@ ages that have been acknowledged .
for the onward connections the municipalities are responsible .
you have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or the refurb@@ ishment of these properties must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility varies from the country &apos;s office and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed to be very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration is not found private apartments .
there has never been working yet to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communities must be ch@@ ased as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be set up in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a firm place , there are tra@@ ine@@ ers , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and helpl@@ ess@@ activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help master @-@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very neat , how Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
she hopes that the work for the Common Market has a positive effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a sense of belief .
so , we need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so , you can also jump here administration and volunteer .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must explain to the refugees that it takes time and it can be sensible to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work or be useless , which will never be integrated .
the distinct majority is motivated .
problem problems are , however , says customer honestly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two of the latest incidents fear of radic@@ alisation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client likes to name quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of na@@ ï@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not want to exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed be the hel@@ pers already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks they put completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , the main - and volunteers must take place on site and in the region according to activities .
yet they are always in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question is clear to answer , do not shy away from politics .
actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already busy so that the human beings are reasonably priced .
that is currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them to agree to both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf looked for In@@ gl@@ cher with Hel@@ icop@@ ter
the police helicopter flew around one hour into different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are penetr@@ ated by the Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and hit the in@@ hol@@ de into the run .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well masks , they bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ dou@@ lis .

the flag@@ ging ran without success .
eventually the unknown was falling close to the apartment or their flight .
