<seg id="1">Clinics and Comumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential courses are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to bend the economy to death and adjust to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be very different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively cycle on regulations, and he stands strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantage opportunities and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost password-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaching of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, the internal discussions could still be given on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more visible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and refunds coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate change agreement wants to announce." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in contrast with their investment programme, Clinton intends to expand and demand the renewable energy investment programme:" "" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposition-fish trade agreement, they both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both Americans want not to isolate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then also be paid better, calls for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage does not have to be changed, then he may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand stands Trump, which aims to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out to him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim a official end of the eight months of the long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Peter's Palace in reception, I cannot fend the intrusion that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the shake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles worked out malignant and he hardly lacked any heat, even for its returning conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly said to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report full of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if never had something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me to interpret the contrary rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of the Putin-radiant, sustainable radile showed that Russia's head of Russia had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductions: the shutdown of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was horrified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in their back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild their veaway is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most severe officials believed that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, which could be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan whom he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is in the first place all friends who he can get after last month at a failed state coup d "état almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the visual television, cheap fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti worded it:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes for long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as there was a weak answer to the attempted power of power.</seg>
<seg id="38">Moreover, the continuing resentment of the snow-accession of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader in Ankara won certainly a bonus that he sought after a coup d "état for the elected government system.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which even has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace made by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me a analyst, "alliance of outsiders": two countries who violate the West and badly treats himself from the West.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support conflicting sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might signify that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both Presidents met at the press conference, they had not even stressed the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intened to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster, as the NATO member Turkey the Russian Battleage - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had to speak at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Chief of Chief of Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanka was a couple of years part of the narrowest of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representatives for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanov by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy managing director since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his graduation at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (on Russian) that it was later appointed chairman and chief executive director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your occupation as President of Law and Control to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and have recommended vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the closest Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of chief, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men argued that the Chief of chief will resign on his own desire.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This now knows no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as potential president, to once want to lead Russian environmental policy - came across big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website said Ivanov "it's true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated positions - you could almost say - troubleshooting for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB was appointed, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got to power he called Ivanov than one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third presidential term of coup against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching associates Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">M. Keith Brown, the building site today was a visit and was one of the first to come to the bridge from the country.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering of engineering from a truly epic size in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise tolerance for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the entire bridge decks at its place and the last section of the Decks gets a begongation for the deck, meaning that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the Viaduct 222 meters long is, about 6,000 tonnes, and at a slope of about 3% had to be pulled up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on monitors on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later this came into a drawing series, game cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture declined in front of the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed due to massive demand that overlap the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players take their smartphone outside and look for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured"</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps which rejects the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardisten, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35.000 users, distributed the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent to jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "from the sofa," "" "and" "" "engage in deaf ear, because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives exercise regularly, reduces its chances to become ill to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">The three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are cosmopoly toys, which have always to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps as FitBit had already been following our activity previously, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its allure and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine doing among the women's Olympic Games in Turnen and this is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been at any summer Olympiad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this squad, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdine is and Madison Kocian, which is Katholicin, are round off, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turnermen an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympic winning Olympics and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be witnessing the incredible performance of the three-fold world cup in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but mastered Gymatic routinely supplied.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans who won gold at an individual multi-campus event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but do not see agriclasses in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last Five" "" "because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like Turning a dearer sport is and Turner combine first and foremost in private trainers that are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel - and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnast and families). the list can continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in affluent suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the gymnast will receive their overall training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes, since they started with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must give the congregations countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an active and easy-to-reach trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have established my turnouts for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable turkeys in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and identification for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits to health and for training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the Turning and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team member and thank you, so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Verbander in New York to find out how to handle armed robbers on distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind the rear, this video will show you how you turn around for your predators.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, then you should turn off as a first, so you can see your attacker and move from the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your front and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it down with the knee in the groin and rotate, while the attacker attacks against pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the run into the face and move back, while they judge the weapon upon him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the weapon and rotate them so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from its grip before they move backwards and set the gun at it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel insurance underwent its immune system and litgereflex of a serious testing - by taking some of the narrowest and ecatest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabed his course on a Euro-Schein, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher-slip and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the derivative of each object he used a Lumintometer to show us and to show us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filtered under the title "The Lickenker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to drop the rinsing knob of a train station, which was already used by thousands of others, may actually be completely repulsive, but in fact you are in a kitchen sinks more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals concerning the promotion of intestine bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately left nothing, what he stretched, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to sink down from toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely placed under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "already as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just in line with his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial dropped a luminometers of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison with this the luminescent age of fresh-sized hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse, after their Luminometers for 4000 units was, while fresh washed hands one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel guide "The Lickenker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "that comes the worst that I have taken in a toilet, near." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">The company is composed of Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted the consumers to offer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about products, we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the gut is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me lost my respect for Ian, if he would have tasted some of things I would like to lead him, just like the ekelike Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian, to swallow them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents replied lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent reported that they may at least occasionally use products that included padding lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B 27 is restored, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for construction works, which begin at 5.30 am and until at 8 pm, there is always praise.</seg>

<seg id="8">The debug is also praised for construction works, for instance when it comes to setting up persisting cruises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site arrived on Monday to the south and also the block of Aspergisroad in Ofterdingen was lifted, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation is relaxed within the place.</seg>

<seg id="13">The inhabitants of bachelor Street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shafts were seeking and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed bumps are not met, the church increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössing.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has been asking for a request by Göhner if there would be a financial compensation, the host site benefited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 Now it must also include the disadvantages, which surrender to the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other counties where there was a little more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all suits, Göhner is sure that his hosts will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here already since 1715, he pointed to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are less common due to complicated traffic control, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot go down, it is also somewhere nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his trunk-clicks after the end of the redevelopment work again, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hosts in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel wars, the pay-off pay worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it is running around.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the back-back campaign, there is a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts with the deliveries to the second half-year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past year, Europe's largest carmakers can decline in the course of the year despite the diesel affaires due to its many brands and some well-run markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July the core brand VW is weakened primarily in Western Europe and lodged with it again the total sale, as noted in the Dax company.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the world, the brand VW in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, following China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany canned the supplies for almost one hexagon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand leader Jürgen Stackmann conducted the weaker figures from July, especially on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it was commissioned in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions" a department of purchasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, British vote also charged the British vote for resignation from the EU, explained a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhausts initially escalated first, also continues to become a minus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected house in the Lower Saxony is still further glimpsed through the diesel scandal: after the first seven month's just a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles on buche.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group leader Fred Kappler managed to continue a sales split from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen in this time, 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been tampered with a software subscription.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, approximately 2.5 million wagons is calling for an upgrade into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, VW, that the rebuilding of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After rearmament of the vehicles it does not provide any deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motoring time.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Motorauer set the client after rearmament a "guaranteed equal" certificate, but I do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was on Friday in business trips.</seg>
<seg id="24">The cause of any legal intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen grant its German customers a guarantee for rusting diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed this last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Labor.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has completed the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations of these are not accepted," declared Federal Minister of Labor Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that the use of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motoring after the upgrade does not take any deteriorations, and have all the type of licence-relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "warranty" but not as it was made in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guaranty, Volkswagen provides the opportunity that customers get a half-year after the retrofit for example with an engine handling in a workshop - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the customer interest, it is important to avoid that it is with any other damage that have nothing to do with the bugging scandal, to any uncertainty as possible with regard to possible warranties, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged woman love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you share the commentary in order to borrow it under the pseudonym non-aging age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most noted revival of sound plates is not limited to a boom in millennials which would like the realism of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horserby amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for himself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild, before I stand, my hands hold and something determinative like: "so, let's throw a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of sohos slowly gains in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I made by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged middle ages) into the Reckless Records (data of middle ages, a woman, probably around 20), is one day due to a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and again items that he sold when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things when I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, are more introverted and would like to spend their own time, and adds: "I smoke not and I drinks not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers, which he meets to meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and ask themselves to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who sold their records to buy them CDs, sell their CDs to get back their records, "says he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the plate of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel blown away from the digital world and want to withdraw from the stability of familiar soundplattends, by objects, the happy jewels.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to go mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flattends a staff of a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I die through a stak of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men aged middle ages) has noticed a "Trophäenaspekt" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came only recently here and said," "" "I do not own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put them into the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it's happening definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musiklas.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which only slowly come.</seg>
<seg id="44">Barrel that has dedicated the sound records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizers and sexcpacker pop instead of experimental jazz. speakers from speakers - it's good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks unusual but nave psychological traumas are hard to detach if you stand for approximately 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variance of the boards.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is making a shop of a shop of a shop.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not earn much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a loved sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business from which is said that a new generation of plate lovers is to have inspired: urban oufitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that jeans the hotspot, I observe a group of young teenager, which group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to attach them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most of for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and in online foren, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through Lake Conwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator who ascends over the shoulders of the middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to a ruprupt halt on Thursday evening at a ruprupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten up in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, pushing, scheduled run and roher power to win gold - her first Olympic champion of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was reconciled by the not too bad trophy of silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they were able to take great pride in their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji on this form could have been a 15-man team in that form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it lost under Ryan of each game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop is weaving to do, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started and left the attacks of GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if one would go into driving buses 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau left over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack on the right-hand corner which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly accepted the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hectic bustle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate to achieve but there has been Fiji on Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch-down and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the refiff and there was still more than a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by other weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji on it was born to play the 7 while GB still undetects.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijilian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South consulate, whose fans were cheeks, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff topped, the Fijis embraced himself and GB kicked crushing in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji Japan had defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain ended South Africa in a scarce mid-season from the race - British transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half forward but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive piece of work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside teams, assured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by a fight with the cancer of the trainer for the Rudersieg</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinalerts gold as with these games and that wants to hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stop to the last, 220 hard hieve that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her goldenem moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it were only the two who sat at the Rugs, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was omnipresent when she moved to the second Olympias in two without a tax result, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which had such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39.4 uncurved use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete who glide on the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not reflected the type of painting.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing, a battalion will contribute to willing helpers that make the difference and it was no one assistant as the trainer who would not survive this day before, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start in early 2014, out of season, could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that in such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who had a nerve-vening morning to talk something more than usual and thus tried to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was as captain in the Royal Arllery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeated, how much I mean that how much I and Helen, and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person or would like to wish for a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost not a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "Stay in the process, remain in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not suggesting something Great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race as well as we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, your own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular exchanges, the senior social contacts can take up and maintain social contacts.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the singing, the head is also called a special achievement, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>

<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, betrays Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 sinking people, who doesn't listen to it when a sound is off?</seg>

<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the intervention.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitibly towards breed.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it enables snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities on such a way that borders the Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be paintings by Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unversioned, standardised tools, which generate more than 30 million enhanced selenium per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the failures come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn up criticism in the past that they were accused of having the app's Blackface formal or white skin as beauty ideal propagate.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week proposed a filter for some Users, which gave them slips, false teeth and soaked wool, there were some critics a racist cartoon by Asiats - "Yellow-face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy had a major problem that the company has engaged with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and motherboard, a day after snapchat, that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asian.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders that have experienced racism, recalled the filter to hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail I wrote Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artificial student whose Tweet was widely used over the photos that the filter was "hurtful and hard to say."</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that "it is difficult to argue with the countertop of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not drastic, but that the yellow head was drawn into the throwing extremes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trenches.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an unending dense and integrational approach, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diversed in the race than their older opponents - could possibly expect to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filtering a picture generated, that for a user is offended, "so it is much harder that such matters remain unnoticed when it was in the case," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided to work as a product manager and engineer as a medium to delete their snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a phone interview, she said that rind-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the inclusion of snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the big part white, only male leaders and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no number of representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they said such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin paints which work there, but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat, the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company has recently set up a personnel responsible to meet its population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she is closed to her snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Among the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly evolving and inescapable, a rapid season between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic Fackel himself would be a burning rod, which is used by wristings to the turers to the trimmer to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop without about Simone Biles, Katie Legendy or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le clos to listen.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is logon Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with grassy area, would certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fennel.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for gold in the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame does not illuminated any event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should do humble arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been a Olympic event already since 2000, when it had been in Sydney its debut, it became the last 16 years so sparely perceived that many people had asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympias portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in a trampoline and had a athletes until 2012 has managed it to the end-day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outdoor swimming charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unresolved ear suitable for a clownsschool as the most suitable for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a salvest enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonic trembling of its never ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging conquers jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pikes and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are judged as the official Olympias for the execution, level of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-eight athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go ahead in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and down, down and down in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the cellinia or the outwall, but also another erosion target: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted endeavor is nobel, admirable, even fanatily - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator at tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself feel when looking at these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the oaf-jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moving forward is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then gradually down, then effortless again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curved into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's such Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end-round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is radiating the narrower as part of a afternoon-area on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the level of consciousness can only be achieved through the Anglization and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently opened according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his to breathe fresh fans.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, the political changes in Ethiopia calls for violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that thousands of protesters during clashes with the police have been killed at sussani.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia exactly going to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the strongest countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "but in the last months protests against the government flowed the country and expanded in more areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people plunged onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was merciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses raised that policemen slaughtered and killed on unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests that are likely to show themselves from the last or the beginning of this year, show how safety men were forced to strike young people, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now asking for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the notice pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia has been anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have repeatedly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereas disperses were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you want to suppress people and have no other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopies.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground use up to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a extended election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border into Eritrea is rising; a struggle for these jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which were more or less enforced in recent years, will benefit the turbulence and become rearming again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of which are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, which is at regular intervals, especially in protests, does many people still communicate via Internet-Proxies who hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered themselves to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from edics mainly to Christian floods, in politics and economics, while they are exploited by the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former wine leader, was until his death a non-publicized disease in the year 2012 17 years Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who was able to think corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly grasped to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special officers to deal with opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively uncareful reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopians, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst declare that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, according to the declarations of Analytiker seemingly, were deceived by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">The development experts of the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal mischief of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it occupies a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of the protesters in Gondar, a amharical city, of Tigray-guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is always more complicated in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests perished the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although they recently rushed to have closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he does not want to bring his allies in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS 'sarcasm. "</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by announcing that his multiple repealed assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="4">It also brings his collaborators who try to take him during an eventful phase in order to explain his peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at a election event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump drew back in regards to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt MEP, Hugh Hewitt wanted to help to weaken the statement by simply reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential election did not want to know anything of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticisms pointed out to Mr. Trump when he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign due to finalisation of the survey values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter followers he warned that Mrs. Clinics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinics emails, but later he said, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be taken, as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think it's cleverly enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even an addition to its tone as its survey values move further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who has been published on Friday, showed a guided tour with a large advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal contributors to the irregular situation to stand unto him, regardless of how provocative may also be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercents, has given great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, served in Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister, it allowed IS to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebra is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>

<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robust with this maximum speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This shaped lifestyle, however, seems to be a panacea of a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate from a Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein, commented by the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for whirlpools.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although suspected of the evolutionary biologist already for a long time that Greenland will be stoneage.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is hard to observe, finally they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the skinned coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyles of Greenland researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timespentempo measure her when she retreats six animals with a station of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the awbone of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look Kadaver, which fell down from higher layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a subsidy from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the ruler of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye-lens already occurs in front of the birth of the sharks, the proteins that contain, and are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the liner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons attempts with larger amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimeters length third-term animal, the linsenators submitted a small surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland had normal carbon-14 quantities in their linkers, against the other hand, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 centimeters long Greenland an age of 335 years, while the record-shark could be even 392 years old even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only then got offspring when they are longer than four metres, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers at length could be assigned an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland can become apparent at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for whirlpools.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record-hand, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon at the Naking a 120 year old harpoon lace, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures there is often the body of the animals living there on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature a bit later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal gives heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than a gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should rather invest on its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Skinner racted last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow, took the voice of the governor, who had made his countrymen Sir Chris Hoy. he made the legend as he stormed home to get a victory of the favourites in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory, while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took part in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the backpacks of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the employee Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this on time as a sign-up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement generated a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed, when they saw potential in the carrots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who continued four years ago with Hoy triumphs - and Skinner in the Qualification round a Olympiarekord, but in the foothills of the New Zealots in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap was short, but Kenny brought the team to front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a great deal of transformation to slow down the pace in a higher course to decelerate it and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert, and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes on when they went on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed a Olympiarekord in the Endrunde, and the World Champion has been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hinder gave, that after a weak start, he clearly fell off the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such a superlative victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said:" "" "it feels with all the GB flags on the bleachers like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer for our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the area of possible that he won Hoys's victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would mean for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploiters of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The emblem of Hoy is equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely, alone to gain.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "saying," "" "If he wins two more gold medals he should be defeated by the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wigberglass, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vierer-four-odometer.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 on the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won in London gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins and Security.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had disputed himself with defendant before the qualification as he set up functionaries to measure its height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the proportionate women's competition, the morning continues and finished, avancied Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archipal, Elinor Barker and Katie Archived of Milngavie in world cold season in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team leaves itself on its strong railway track to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a sling of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were downright.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and harassment and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite then, as the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police are witnesses to witness after a woman was overriding in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman laid down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were taken by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that an Schweizerhof in the age of 49 years, carried out by several vehicles, including a truck, would have to kill themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once more habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the NASA developed a model to discover the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once belonged to a similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow-turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erd@-@ like atmosphere and yet progressed slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the Topographie from the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably referred to more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and be protective against more intense arevaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in der GISS model simulation expires the slow-turn of Venus your daily site of the Sun almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- has been exposed as much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans, and her water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dataloglau: so perfide unimailed hackers you ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of Infection-Malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the Malware defense specialist, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partially repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmac software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany about 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid ready by the perpetrators demanded to use the challenged systems and data to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmac software according to the observations from Malwarebytes to attack on company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "they are successful there, if the potential to prescribing" "" "deletion" "" "is significantly higher than in private users." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of pollutants," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malware programs were still designed to send publicity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only were private users the target, but the change to company attacks was startling quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a victim, it seeks specific files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryps Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users stand the personal photo database on the game, it goes for companies with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German firms surveyed over Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to stop operations completely interrupting, in case of a case humans were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals are victims of attack, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health akacutely.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: paying not, you only promotes the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examined the commercial-conquest areas and the contact with blackmailings and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat on how to pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites or encode free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will private merchants dissolves to payments of a few hundred euros, companies must pay partly tough and 5 digit numbers to withdraw their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider of Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Most likely, however, that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants in form of a software building to the actual blackboard.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kits were created by making the malware even, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that minor configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmains are then looking for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per billing.</seg>
<seg id="36">"commonly asked the criminals then spammer with the spread," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known with many companies that make their data better secure.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies operating in the Malwarebytes survey rely on how to repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful creation, the perpetrator will instead be explained with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The damage potential according to type of data is still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon showed the strict security explorer how they could get connected with the Internet of connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a distressed heating could certainly be a ransom of so many victims.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then, instead of the heating in the future, block the whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be an issue in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you eat eternally, at night you are awake hours of hours, in the morning there is no longer to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about one quarter of adult ingestion and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or insoming disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be many causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, Board member of the German Society for Schlafes and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one sees among them is, however, is the insomnia, so an inhalation and sleepy-compulsive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Precisely that all sleep many people as unsatisfying or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, Vorboard member in the German Hausdentist association with practice in Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind bedbugs?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors depressing each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a slipped disk, can lie bad, waking up every two to three hours and begins to awning on, about everyday problems and worries, gives Weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should we talk to sleep insoming to your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who have not sleep well over a month of a month at least three nights per week and is compromised by the day should go to the doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unsettling, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, among other things, changes in behaviour, cognitive behavioral therapy or medicines - classical sley pills can be used only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - question.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly any nurtured medical doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedtime, one should contact the primary doctor first, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clear with examinations whether the problems have a bodily cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the sleeping laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleeping laboratory, medical diagnosis, for example in snoring with airways, in case of disease-fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sleeal disorder, declared fiercing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Actually, it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not ask a midday," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After sale one goes to his normal time into bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one has a nose-goggles, a chest strap, and a antennae at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is characterized by the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the problems cope with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting ways to which one can bet for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts: regular sleeping-time, not too long in bed, do not sleep too long in bed, do not watch tv, stop alcohol and at night not at the clock - then you begin to anticipate immediately, and that's quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lenses, meanwhile with a rest of the cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walk along the road from east to west, one comes along the slots, a fresknitted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the facade of a gray house somebody has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a lidl which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rentals are expected here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood" as the responsible real estate company, Friedrichshain calls, will be prefered with burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rented agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel had repeatedly called for a hard action of police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled out the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, lockout parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown domestic owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and builders under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road looks peaceful: parents walk with children strolling around with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained Prem Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lie a basic school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main city of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who draws here three children, above all from the police site.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of domestic projects they share the care of rising rents and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a psy, which partly provokes Polizeischutz on the left hand side.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, used by the Berlin coursenator and the police between domestic and their neighbours, does not appear as obviously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today also has a low average of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dwellings and the native residential projects have long been part of Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses have been occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police killings in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: the inhabitants of the GDR today share their inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the rents since 2009, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them in charted discs or freshly squeezed facades which have been carded with paint.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words" "" "centre-based violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make the facts that tend to meet newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a house house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for the rule of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which they have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also give it directly in the Rigaer for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal case, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the inhabitants will return their street: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly invaded the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitant like Neugebauer, the street will continue to take away: through spotlessly newbuildings in former construction pieces that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "they are ultimately condominium apartments which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not share." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if one never listens to somebody?</seg>
<seg id="36">So on all sides frustration a, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For sugar, which fret about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who comes from, should be aware - just like someone who is in a pub that can complain bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons just asked with names names have asked not to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee-officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogos supports the team of management for Achim Grockenberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is still misleading.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the eigh wool, who has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less ridicules, rather than on the multitude of desire, are purposeful - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a hurry Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes, as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent position in the period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle honour- and full-time actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organisational, human and interpersonal problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connecting hostages that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the onward connections the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or the refurbishment of these properties must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility varies from the country's office and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed to be very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration is not found private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">There has never been working yet to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communities must be chased as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be set up in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "in addition to a firm place, there are traineers, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and helplessactivities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or set up." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master-master, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very neat, how Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the Common Market has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a sense of belief.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, we need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, you can also jump here administration and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "it must explain to the refugees that it takes time and it can be sensible to bridge the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, should not work or be useless, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem problems are, however, says customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two of the latest incidents fear of radicalisation, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client likes to name quite clearly," "" "what kind of naïve might call" "". "a Restrisiko could and would not want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized be the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks they put completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, the main - and volunteers must take place on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Yet they are always in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, do not shy away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy so that the human beings are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them to agree to both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
