Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Tehran destabil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
but it is also meant to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for many years .
Washington critic@@ ised the ongoing settlement of Israel , and he casts a lack of desire during the peace process .
by the Obama &apos;s prime deal for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with regard to the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel .
in a de@@ cl@@ amation , Professor , his friend said to have shot
in a de@@ cl@@ amation , Professor Sh@@ annon was talking about a kind of hesit@@ ating voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house .
he was important to emphasize that being &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family @-@ contacted the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a handmade note that I wanted , I could do it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he was travelling in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police for a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did the full emergency emergency one day later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police took him .
one day after the shooting at the University , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
the details provided by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but probably difficult teachers .
students said they were happy about their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , he did not have any history of violence or criminal history .
while Schmidt was mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful person &quot; he shared his academic life .
both set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose classes are 17 members , and many students visited the courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination of problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , he &apos;s praised that he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something happened to him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that the Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of this academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a defend@@ ant for health reasons and said he had any other health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the university marked that promotion , for which he had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for the automatic way to a recru@@ iting as a Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that he cannot answer .
after escape from campus the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he was returning to Arkan@@ s@@ as import@@ ation .
before he could be arrested , kill herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents &quot; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ niche meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he began his work at the university of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , under@@ directed geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long standing friends of Lam@@ bs received him as an intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the very cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was then the women &apos;s s@@ warm .
all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick building , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago but have stayed friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he &apos;s never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined both in one summer of the year three years ago .
but later they played together the one or the other bands .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter write and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ l was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ening Bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s rock and Pr@@ enti@@ ce Night in the night 5th September looked , after his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ acy had finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the floor and che@@ ering with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the next professor , led the former term semester program and specialized in American native inhabitants and colonial history , told Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his bro@@ therhood and of the Student Committee .
on Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland , on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community are part of a candle @-@ based commem@@ oration .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the wake @-@ guard , whereas the Universal Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the education will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this testim@@ onial .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that he was shot a call , and that lamb was shot at his emergency , when his wife called his wife , but there is no indication of the fact that the two have ever got married .

Michael J. Fox As@@ sever@@ s about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ ust and a wi@@ el@@ ength of it , to be with the princess of Wales on a date .

UN CEO , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of men .
the UN CEO again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the A@@ GM of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an asked for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated with Iran in achieving a nuclear war .
8 survey values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious about to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of the Nom@@ ination of the estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
none claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain during 2011 , none of which also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external side groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for An@@ growth now recognize Tr@@ umps of persever@@ ance and begin to let off their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values , sug@@ gesting that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tri@@ umps of properties have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ z@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tick .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week told 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if the dump would be nominated .
only two of them say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as a ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees Re@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump has critic@@ ised its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans of the Irish re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament to a president , N@@ BC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pres@@ et state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his job , and nearly six out of 10 un@@ dependent argue that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se into the White House , N@@ BC / post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put their jel@@ ly , Republi@@ can voters are tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , tell a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July took their money to everyone .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters are seen as plau@@ sible .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump will not attack anyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter field is likely to contribute to a few umps where anti @-@ p@@ umping support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us@@ .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ head @-@ race between p@@ umping and most other Republi@@ can candidates , p@@ umping the majority support .
he did 2 points ahead of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , especially Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally from edge Paul , John Kast@@ el and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would catch the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that just over half of the elec@@ torate will support the dump , say that they have been awarded their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can truly say anything to change .
46 percent said they leave the door open for change to other candidates .
nonetheless , tri@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for b@@ ump .
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign against two months ago , the immigration field was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration and ful@@ crum in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ net by Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the new @-@ government efforts .
but following the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to do well .
the frustration of the government climb up new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , primarily by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines reg@@ isters / Bloomberg in I@@ owa 2 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential units of Germany
here in the Hob@@ ro@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea basin .
in the street it costs a square meter roof in a cut @-@ up of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited to this part &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows how special layers are the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ areas , however , it is at the price as pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate provider angel &amp; Völ@@ s has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying places .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , comfortable .
but well , who can afford it ...
incidentally , Munich is an exception not to the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ scor@@ er in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky winds of Thomas Müller ar@@ omas the FC Bayern the way to a contribut@@ ory 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sou@@ l@@ lion re@@ opening of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have brought a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crew of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their launch game in the Champions League at the Greek record high@@ school Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers Double ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Day in series shall be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take at the Hen@@ kel@@ potential to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was born on 28 February in the Champions League for Bayern @-@ leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made his way as an flan@@ k of the world &apos;s grand@@ master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate &quot; had promised Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis of Mag@@ yar with 31 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s thought .
they showed a focused and engaging idea without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the royal class , including well known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , at seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were all grace@@ ful , with their un@@ aggressive endeav@@ ours but often to on@@ less to works .
the attacks were often initiated by the sie@@ ge on Lin@@ ks@@ im Douglas Costa , who came through rarely against the earlier Braunschweig region Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate on the right side than his f@@ lange on the left upper left side of the Tor@@ que .
during the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms rant Ide@@ ally Brown taken the head@@ ball of the Poles from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct damage , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee par@@ ched ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although Bayern was used to her to the dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could put a needle .
on Tor@@ be@@ trot@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was aband@@ on@@ ment .
as for example , he had a shot of ideas about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a quar@@ rel with David Al@@ aba in the center of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , according to muscular problems back at the Ka@@ der , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero did not give green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports curtain Matthias Sam@@ ers at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else of it , this is already mal@@ ignant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during his first change gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he gave King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Le@@ wand@@ ler Pil@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ feet , Müller served an eye .
in front of the game it happened in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partially reconstructed Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ bloc he had apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts pir@@ atory with words and ges@@ tures , the security forces attacked and went with drums against Munich &apos;s supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk , teeth to lose
who smo@@ kes , ins@@ ane therefore not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that defines a central Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ term study .
the good news : at ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is the result of a long @-@ term study of an international research team including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ ker the risk of losing their teeth early in order to reduce the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val &apos;s cause , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis it was an risk factor , empha@@ sizing the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore tend to go back on common teeth with smokers .
not resolved , how much smoking is also the risk of tooth decay .
people dealing with smoking could reduce their risk however within a short amount of time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years to the endangering again at the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich explained by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained manager H@@ a Boeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels , and according to our knowledge also leads to a good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 is aged from 65 to 74 years of harm@@ lessness , DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier examinations would have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early failure .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ate the findings .
archae@@ ologists b@@ ump in the Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from the late period
the repe@@ ats time had been made on the right bank of the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne archaeological finds .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new navigation bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ isches Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings were excav@@ ated , said museum manager Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , there are historians on the lookout for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all building projects in the city district Cologne , the museum has always drawn attention as a department of arche@@ ological soil care .
in the third section of the R@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists have now been found .

apart from the remains of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ry , a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves had also been discovered , which probably belongs to the church .

EU Commission is propos@@ ing a new court in stri@@ fe
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system for the resolution on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) .
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the responsible EU @-@ Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the United Kingdom has warned against the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade discussions with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP should create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
plans for the reform of the current arbitration proceedings specifically look to the fact that the EU States and the US will select independent judges for a new investment portfolio .
they should come from equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgment .
until now the procedures carried out together in the arbitr@@ ator , there was no objection against their jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the last months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to go to a International Court of Investment .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clarified .
most of all , large @-@ scale @-@ resident investor @-@ arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .

delic@@ acy Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart that recorded the sh@@ y@@ earning Fol@@ ks@@ um to the picturesque US state of Michigan with film p@@ aves .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is practically taken by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
he relates by various places he always featured on the map to tell about his min@@ u@@ vi@@ ously and tender songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens always proves to be wonderful creations .
after the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart , composed songs , which are harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk of the late 1960s , but can always go into great opul@@ mon@@ k .

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the most influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then performed to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic promises .
this sixth proper studio album is still broadly orches@@ tr@@ ated , but also based on programmed sequences or be@@ ats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall .

although there is nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly embr@@ aced Stev@@ ens go back to intimacy and to folk .
without putting a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience ends : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can put the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n@@ debut near the he@@ ap of prime minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n@@ debut is expected at the launch of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is alleged to give his debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister , and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six succ@@ e@@ eding questions shortly after lunch , while his performance is likely to be tested by the media and by the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n@@ ade , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabin and after his speech on the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the nation , has prov@@ oked a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism from a number of T@@ ory authorities and is at the center of several title @-@ related stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in a respectful of silence , &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n@@ Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news program , he got to sing the Labour Party , to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadows @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s top team , and it coinci@@ ded with differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while fewer than one @-@ sixth of the Parliam@@ entary Party was initially supported him as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states that political differences also st@@ acking within Labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Even Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on position on the European Union and the limit of profitability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party &quot; was very clear &quot; that they would only be against the plans for government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds on 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since he &apos;s T@@ ory boss , has over the last decade to face the Disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
the Labour chairman , who promised another policy proposition , says he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the leader of the Prime Minister is to confront it , and that he is made both &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and fighting with resistance , and instead involving serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges of young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is taking the shadows of economics at him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally show the Word and that he was John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sau@@ cer , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of an &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the leader of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he adm@@ its that he has failed in it .
as she was first sent on television in 1990 , the question was regarded with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position under his parliament@@ arians , though critics argue that they have become a caricature and more op@@ pressive reforms .

the pound has climbed up more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was cr@@ acked up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 7@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was .

potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both are both - and in the m@@ ashed @-@ law , the wine @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; carto@@ ffle , &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat has put on a mirror .
the idea brought him a poster at a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er , &quot; which he had been seen by chance on television .
since then in his shop a barbecue which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has now grown to be present at the Patent Office in Munich .
it has been safegu@@ ar@@ ded according to the authority of the authority since recently as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the mirror contains , Al@@ hair does not want to reveal .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better yet , &quot; he finds .
even with his customers the culinary understanding is good .
Met@@ cash launches floor area for the fight against Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground position campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the Ig@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice@@ berg S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ us@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops , and shop @-@ owners , who sell tickets for the South Australian football matches to loyal customers .
it is expected to publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September , if the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices carry out its annual investors strategy .
it is much in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia generate nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ cargo business and generate higher stakes entries as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A network in the East @-@ states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in East Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of his first markets roughly five percent of the food market will take away in these two states and all the existing players , but mainly independently retailers .
one published in this week estimates the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers could lose 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is due to the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve a turnover of € 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and with the quantities of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ cost , Met@@ cash could cost approximately 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eat in Melbourne , that Metal is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and arri@@ vals from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food business , which approximately 1.200 has been provided by 43 percent , which has been well reflected in debt reduction on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler posts however and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to purchase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ eg@@ s by hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers to improve their stores by getting faster , fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private @-@ label food products .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s leading business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and load rehabilitation programmes are to be transferred to el@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to win successful growth .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis does not deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly rather critic@@ ised as a critique of his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; which helps with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying play in Cincinnati , afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ aki had to be separated from the arbitr@@ ator twice in which Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to stra@@ ined and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ quet , after a cr@@ amp tra@@ ged a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ te@@ akis was defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at present in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing , about which I was pretty brave me , is the fact that after my view Than@@ gs was put a little into the battle , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a strike , when he lost for a cr@@ amp to the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out a bat out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ x good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated with a little bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in his team and so on , he has never trained a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration during the important decision @-@ giving decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding the controversy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick was very quick to climb , on which people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary states p@@ unch , closing the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explained the emergency pan@@ ties and bol@@ ted the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to go illeg@@ ally to the country . everything ended with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the fron@@ tier , when hundreds of migrants killed themselves in a No Man @-@ country and Serbian officials murdered with indign@@ ation .
the people fle@@ fled from violence were hidden for an unknown period at the road between the two lines of control of the countries and erected tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ating rose to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks will be held in Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turmoil in the ung@@ ular @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc at a str@@ it@@ ated meeting in Brussels did not agree a common immigration policy .
however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking to hide in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary won &apos;t put up his hopes for a fran@@ k in Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions called for more powers to cope with the crisis so they could block streets and ha@@ sten@@ ance with asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also has to trace the construction of a bar@@ bed dra@@ h@@ one along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having stopped a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ers had been used in the competition , the Stak@@ han@@ wire @-@ Zau@@ n between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an accession point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most of the upcoming economic migrants are seeking a better life , and not battle @-@ workers who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ wo@@ u that rebuild the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also cover higher pen@@ alties for used human merchants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that has ar@@ isen through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said T@@ ov@@ acs K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the driver of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press reported heavily to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police @-@ food and be accused of har@@ b@@ ade against the new laws .
authorities are being able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials killed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train carri@@ ages with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ged the major borders of the Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to work on people &apos;s data and sup@@ press a crowd @-@ crowd in order to sup@@ press oneself .
approximately 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains its opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not prom@@ ul@@ g@@ ated yet if he establishes for the presidential office , receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the commen@@ cement of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion will determine which candidates will support them .
but life &apos;s supporters are more durable in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ BS posted some profit .
Clinton keeps a big edge with women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have been adjusted .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is just back with 5 points .
Clin@@ ics &apos;s benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 has exp@@ elled and they are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has still a great start with the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was before S@@ anders along with a two @-@ digit lead with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders will now have a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections , for example , say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some advantages , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six per cent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ics are the current suppor@@ ter of everything you are enthusiastic about .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would be delighted to support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters want to say that they can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republic &apos;s voters do so via its peak can@@ di@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when clinics are asked in an open question why they want them to be the nomin@@ ee is the most common response that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time to become a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she &apos;s the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ ics supporters , your association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and voters are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President raises potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of those democratic voters want to see it in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked by the elections who would be a second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clin@@ ics &apos;s followers say more than half that bees would be their second choice far ahead of others .
if Bi@@ den does not decide to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics lead to S@@ anders , out of 20 points with bi@@ den in the competition at 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to consider Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win , but this figure has declined from 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in these measurement , but the percentage that has been shown to him as the most sel@@ ectable .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate call voters &apos; voters &apos; questions concerning the constitu@@ ency .
similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voting in the elections is un@@ unacceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with a few important mem@@ o@@ ists in the elections of their party elections .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from honesty , while clinics &apos;s strength are the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
the democratic voters of the elections in general seen Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ a@@ ideological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters has no mind of S@@ anders .
since questions of Hill@@ ary clinics use a personal email address and a server for office as an out@@ minister , most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated considerably .
they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , over six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters in their party as a whole : only 32 percent do they see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ torate will also be tr@@ ump as un@@ tru@@ ely and un@@ tru@@ stable .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good scores on leadership .
of the six tested candidates in Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut out honesty .
a majority may look rather than honest , but like Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the failure rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving ahead of a nationwide survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present at the latest survey of C@@ BS news / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Candi@@ dates dis@@ miss half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically at stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support for@@ b@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate over the past month to 27 % in survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son l@@ oss 4 % at 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and b@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education centers .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ ose , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest fell , namely 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ es and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third position with 6 % .
the error at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was executed in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in the pol@@ ls - he lands with 19 % support at the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at one of the last week rising car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some sec@@ tari@@ al for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed for it to question a dimin@@ ishing faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a concert show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , for swimming vacations already a trip to the Mediterranean , to find even the warm water .
a bathroom in North or Baltic are likely to be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : maximum 18 degrees Celsius in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
the sea temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in France , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ newcom@@ er
nearly two years after being a student during a lay@@ ered ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , dec@@ eit , are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood led Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a performance process in September 2013 and hesit@@ ated to go to hospital what has contributed to his death , distributed the police with .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with linked eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally made about headaches , then he immediately fell around .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ PSI Brotherhood does not spro@@ ut the emergency number 911 that Den@@ g was powerless and waited for an hour before putting him into a hospital , so the police force .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; Gr@@ ab ef Chris Wagner , said on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and exhibited the welfare of the Brotherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Political @-@ Officer Wagner .
he could not be revived , and he died next morning to his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ ic report , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unter force injury to head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ra@@ ils of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year at the Shi@@ ps , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ a family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a county Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
twenty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for media attacks and forming a criminal association .
&quot; we not only want to take responsibility for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ officially - this will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
a raise @-@ raise will come , and the house will get into the che@@ at , get ren@@ ces for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all this will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy provides a small guide to the process .
a recession came under the first interest rate within just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in which the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so heavily stressed that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find however that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ k@@ eb@@ om at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at low levels to go to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is one of the historical trends that are based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as seen in the market last month , the fores@@ try of interest rates may be volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase touches , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to deri@@ ve investments from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened on interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually inf@@ ring@@ ing within the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , then back to average state after 500 days , with average yield in the past six consecutive cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Chef facility @-@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s released .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks will occur later in the down@@ fall @-@ cycle and the return on the stocks thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest @-@ increases are often encouraging them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which did not exist before and that could speed up a recession .
extremely remarkable is that gross domestic product near its lowest point will be in a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates have existed between 1950 over twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have placed all year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the deb@@ acle of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be approved in this session , the fut@@ ures trading claims that there are only a 25 percent in fut@@ ures .
&quot; in our study all ero@@ y @-@ cycles have taken place from 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ ö@@ w very quickly put after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is an un@@ slow recovery from what the worse recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest in which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the steady income was also volati@@ le , as the market adop@@ ts a zinc raise , and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than with shares , if they are changing their strategic course .
in bonds the rendering time seem to change , as soon as the first increase / lowering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the booster cycle the bond @-@ di@@ mm@@ ed immediately said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in increasing bonds between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab in an analysis .
interesting , Jones doesn &apos;t mean that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest have risen , the increase of fl@@ atter is fl@@ atter , credi@@ ting have been extended and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensified its strategy .
in the large and entire company , companies that participate in the larger share of their business operations in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will become worse because a rising dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market , and as well as financing their debts .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares are incl@@ ined to respond to three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have excell@@ ed under each of the interests of interest in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders and low volati@@ lity in its shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt is a major problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit through the rising dollar .
Spar@@ er could see profits from higher yields , even though experts of different opinions are , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Uni@@ member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of parliament critici@@ zed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; broadcast@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refinement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial rivals .
he also emphasized the BBC Music Awards and said that it im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins access the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts itself &quot; towards Classic FM , claims to be a leader member and raises new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does not do anything the private .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member Andrew B@@ ingham was also saying the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses to record the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ sal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and no longer be distinguished from his commercial rivals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become too Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples which you actually only im@@ itate the im@@ itate which already is on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General reported the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am nowhere to learn from classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that &apos;s really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and put new works on order , I think it is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey that forced to be harder to get involved in the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it , went under fire to enter the commercial rivals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC &quot; way .
he added that he would like the company to find a hit in our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if it starts the next time a show@@ y series .
however , he refused to eliminate the order of other series of The Voice in the future or to give money of the animation of animation for other entertainment formats .
Internet re@@ ps grew in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the line in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping mile &apos;s UK have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online deals are stagn@@ ant , after new figures revealed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with just five percent growth compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales will stagn@@ ate , after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; says Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G selling of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , as a purchaser , to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. home on the sofa .
but now that sh@@ utter and we will possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites broke down .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were struggling for bar@@ gains , buyers can prevent buyers from making a purchase .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium . it was issued by 5 £ spending a bit over £ 5@@ 0.00 .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the shopping can now be carried out via web @-@ stores .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online instead of the Mo@@ de@@ ca@@ vities in the internal cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca in the crane @-@ accident accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already firmly said that the H@@ add@@ an after Mecca with thousands who continue to come to the city go on .
today king Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group should not have the arm of the sick child under control when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ e that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group would be responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency does not reported this detail , but he said that the leadership of the company abroad must be registered overseas .
at the beginning of this week sal@@ man was to reveal what the overthrow of the crane lam@@ ented to plung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place in this month .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European crafts@@ man cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British are increasingly engaged craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que , Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe increases the rise behind
this leads to 200 more pres@@ fix shops , which aim at professional tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q stands will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dant of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that British put their skins and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home .
if you are then sent with a hammer or a brush to the top of walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because British are increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to perform settle jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ Markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to deep @-@ far@@ ed prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other screens for opening up to craftsmen and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are affected by women .
at the moment , the men ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s the men .
she said it was necessary to present itself to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households which make more renov@@ ations than they have in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move it stronger to balance .
basically , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of their decisions on the sale of articles through women .
women play a role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the helm of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also selected its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including management and financial benefits .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ fis@@ her gave a decline in half @-@ year profit and the revers@@ al after the group was at the expense of the bar@@ gain of the shops .
because of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is going to open 200 new branch stores .
Fun@@ c@@ tion@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ bank Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball is formed A@@ I / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ex@@ tradition .
the defend@@ ants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority &apos;s abuse .
by this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted defini@@ tively in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor @-@ ten@@ ant Robert Ri@@ ffel ( pre @-@ examined ) , the defend@@ ants agreed in 2006 to 2011 funds from the accounts used in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage he damages with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sporting function@@ aries are also charged for financial ruin .
this fac@@ tum divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ sen@@ ch@@ ats , Rich@@ keeper Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Germany .
it is intended to be negotiated at a later date .
as a re@@ tention of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense of the association was not an asset in any time .
the functional characteristics would only have been paid and charged for the sports club , for whom it worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money - who carried out the pas@@ sports in the year 2001 around 600@@ ,000 bar@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue to carry the club or lock it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the Br@@ ot@@ eh@@ ner wholes@@ aler camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have paid money to put our life insur@@ ances in the bank as safety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at his acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have agreed with the association , you can manage the money freely , there are only no debt to be made .
furthermore - in the proportionate financial - success , the payout of the allowance for de@@ preci@@ ation declined until 1991 .
therefore , one proportion of the allowance for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account , it pays off .
therefore , flat @-@ rate and not detail covers , explained the former ump@@ mann of the proceedings .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ als managed by the two defend@@ ants , and said the second defend@@ ant .
why the deposits have not been detailed in detail , asked the judge .
the association has not been interested in the details of financial security , it is important only the debt of debt , so the answer .
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was started in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account .
these have been cur@@ sions , the accused .
this decision took place on the names of the second defend@@ ants , and according to its statement it was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the Ju@@ dge .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he said , he said that this is the best for the society .
if something happened to him , no one would have known something about this money , the prosec@@ utor exhibited in the room .
the accused has been informed , ri@@ dged himself the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claims submission . &quot;
why damage ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant explained that he did not agree with this wording as the association had never occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a p@@ enny , he merely charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ eting .
to di@@ eting , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , added .
precise documents for the early years could not be pres@@ umed to the accused .
these are after a work@@ checking in which everything was judged correctly , no longer stored , they said .
o@@ dom@@ eter money also had the second defend@@ ant referred .
all Beh@@ ants were made in cash , in addition he had to drive from his residence to the bank to the bank at Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing resumed on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ extends another 30.000 Jobs
in addition , for the last three years of ongoing staff , the computer @-@ giant will reduce further jobs when running the company .
the positions in the US @-@ computer ri@@ eses He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will find no end .
in the context of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company account .
thereby , costs amoun@@ ted to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a load @-@ load of some 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop down from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs have not been completed for three years .
HP had until the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .

in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printing declined by 1@@ 1.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus the revenue went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a split and massive post@@ ulates on the changes in the industry .
the 76 year old company under the management of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only arrived late that customers will be boo@@ sted by smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are getting more and more stores online .

40 to 50 refugees began to throw bricks and plastic bottles by the officials .
the officials were initially p@@ uted pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .

time in decision of interest rates for the U.S. Not@@ en@@ bank
the world is observed if the U.S. staff bank on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest are raised or not .
a pol@@ l under 80 econom@@ ists were surv@@ eyed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , the F@@ ed that would do that , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Chief of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance and will only generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
she has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of taking such a step are good .
the decision to be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CET on Thursday
death Prot@@ ective at the Delta State University re@@ jects audi@@ ting
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later wrote his colleague his colleagues , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he could tell him &quot; about the first murder and wanted to &quot; he can make it un@@ done , &quot; gave authority on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot to someone and someone killed .
he told the staff of the emergency centre that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house may be , but who will not distur@@ b anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
he gave no explanation for his shots .
when police came to the scene they found the body of Amy Cou@@ enti@@ ce , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am so sorry I wanted , I could not und@@ o it .
I loved Amy , she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he was E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he eventually killed his own life on Monday night when police officers killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , this was alleged that Pr@@ enti@@ ce had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities said at Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; Trinity relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was asked by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married to seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ce would have a daughter who is 19 , and they were &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
re@@ inde@@ xes worked online from home , by statement from L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pr@@ enti@@ ce .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met for approximately three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , stopped at a certain moment on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
when police took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night , drove his car to the side , fled walking , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
he received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , just as its look is on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group for

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United could not play monthly , due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w lap@@ suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture in his right b@@ eins .
while this def@@ ends the left margin position to produce and shut it out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno during the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V domain .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double stroke and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will move on tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then performed in Manchester .
it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is , it has very hard and then happens fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then takes the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that this season will be able to play again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the hanging of an el@@ bow .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al pres@@ ump@@ tive that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ing had wander@@ ing itself .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ fold meter and a red card was due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I will come back more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition : Manchester United States suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat of the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the square , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a her@@ nia , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ a@@ as The Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad in this . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron says The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost back@@ stage .
unless you are David Cameron .
as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , opened in 1971 the Environmental Re@@ bel of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , wrote Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I liked to read my children , as it always seems to have a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead submitting an index of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amidst the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature passed and even the air a commodity it hopes to see a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , being met , &quot; read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 , yet completely unknown .
as if this was not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reads like the summary of that of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of the internet movie database , where all artificial and even the air a merchandise , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here listening to an un@@ named boy , like the local environment caused by the arteries , trees , Th@@ ri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , car@@ cin@@ ous creatures , &quot; which is in the name of the trees , &quot; desol@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax on a child 20 times a child .
a down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Camer@@ leng@@ o &apos;s election office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
to b@@ ade Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task but if one sees the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , stands a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not exclude an upward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ looks page might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin@@ offs in bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een develops Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size to the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this message : Adam Ly@@ th sh@@ igns from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ less will be focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this over - players are their very best expressions .
a long time ago one could have extended the running of ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hope to further further runs out of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his stance , even if he did not get so good performances and that was not surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test man receives , to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th was given seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance for home and for@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift , was that England first put Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a chu@@ ck which I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor game viewer , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he finished 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very much .
it must obtain at least the same chances as that before him , but this depends of course on the team effort in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ een beside Cook , what an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler could perform and four qu@@ icks would be , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a head@@ man cannot strike there , and this lef@@ tist has already shown that he is a devil @-@ shot from cri@@ cket player .
he might not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred years immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited treatment with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and thinking it is a pun@@ t but there are no big number of backup car@@ vers which lift their hands and the coaches have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the crew England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela May@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
it is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , as it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white sphere of tour and brings energy and powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the promised .
Col@@ l@@ ty Team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part do not have a problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and Team@@ work determine not the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit in the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to an allowance if the economy was running into a bas@@ tion in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ res@@ iding re @-@ payment strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU will be deep into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which was severe because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said today that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in different crises , as the EU now is , and not always from its own debt , Britain itself created an agenda with successive concessions and disturbing positions , which they mostly do not wish to be filled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on her Annual General Meeting that it may not like it if they threaten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are climbing for summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies to win reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to enter the UK in the inside of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and we can see that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German chan@@ cell@@ or chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it is bad for her , as it has happened at the exagger@@ ating long @-@ burning like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a dre@@ dging force .
Poland soon has a nationalist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the self @-@ British control whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s res@@ ignation from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even consider some pur@@ pose@@ ful notes , entirely in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s speech launched in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boyfriend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the value of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and what EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , but did not get the rati@@ fication of our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember more than Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ un@@ ists , who made a name for itself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels re@@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ 90s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ten@@ derness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
these include the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing s@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseudo @-@ states that most of our great newspapers have .
actually Tony Blair is similar about her , but established that if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can distribute ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ity as Blair himself when he predicted himself by the referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the EU adopted by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a back door to him .
the press never gave him this .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly clone on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he couldn &apos;t need any time for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cott Mur@@ a Strategy of 80 @-@ s years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position for Europe is - I really put it in place - in development .
it says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ach@@ ful Tenden@@ cy and the wild Ge@@ fil@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may probably say yes to everyone about it .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week said , as the boy sc@@ outs in him strug@@ gled to admit that Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father physically challenged himself to his television , loyal towards his Labour cabinet without losing too far and losing his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
but to fight , to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told its collaborators and members according to all reports on their cl@@ amation on Monday night .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n seeks - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline stays important in the age of TV round the clock and above all things in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a nest of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right that Cameron does not give a free Card for Europe that allowed him to maintain Lab@@ our@@ ours support in the paper campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so well .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in line with their anti @-@ capitalist economy - is no longer just a question of esot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of a small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic controversi@@ es .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander political capital - they also mis@@ trust@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be poin@@ tless ?
the U.S. is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something when starting on Monday by something that called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
expert &apos;s report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that , in their report , critic@@ ise the general public of Public Health England ( phe ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has released the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ granted Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &apos; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y base , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; builds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Service at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should based upon evidence of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that an asser@@ tion of orph@@ ans that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of retro@@ wise and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons , which were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ assessment Analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damages caused by different nicotine @-@ rich products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was a sponsor named before British American Tob@@ acco System ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to publicity health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they received funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing that he was obtained according to reports earlier by the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ xes are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also specify a range of industries in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco @-@ leadership took part in the meeting at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses t@@ ell@@ ingly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most of the products by most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are no such connections or limitations in the orph@@ an report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were so far no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence whatsoever that e @-@ cigarettes had been as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being among orph@@ ans , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been responded to before .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in its addiction .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are minor but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
she has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence exists and not , particularly when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in relation to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year .
through the clear set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without any risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
follow @ Fi@@ ona@@ webeditor BBC should give East@@ on , says former Chief of Channel 4
the ex @-@ president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that cannot be sent by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for them to publicly read public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time window , against the most popular shows of their rivals and from the channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried to make contact with the BBC for six years , with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sends , which were also clearly shown by non @-@ interven@@ tional rivals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the upper @-@ house communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term is not good idea for a good idea , you should at least do it on programs that others do not make or order .
you can send the Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve as widely as possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s natural nonsense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another one , admittedly , both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of BBC show that again , what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal limb@@ o @-@ programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not satisfy their tasks , and they can argue if they have on their sha@@ m missions to the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ scure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
she put them in a window of time , in which no one she ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Radio Station , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all , think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ per year , ask myself whether this is true , because they consume no much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss of David El@@ stein , who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday , asking that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; educate and entertain . &quot;
he said only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV Production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take part in public @-@ law television programs in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform and entertain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships did El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial Tra@@ ins Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Clip &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they are blo@@ ated with sound impul@@ sive .
scientists have cultivated wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by le@@ aks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they are using sound @-@ impulses , which for human consumption have too high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses are working through switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that genetically modified to wear the membrane &apos;s channels which respond to ultras@@ ound sha@@ fts .
further on this topic : scientists read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new procedure , called probe , which can be used in the ultras@@ ound image to enable a string of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat disease symptoms .
F@@ claims are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound sha@@ fts , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced US @-@ waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ ws .
the sound waves bring about the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ otes TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
if he employs ultras@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ ors and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarity with op@@ to@@ ds , a ground@@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to turn the neur@@ ons with impulses of light and switch off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o had some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has been sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound tissues may occur , and so can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily suscep@@ tible human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy advertisements , which was produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists turn up activists throughout the protest movement and notice that they have to go out into the real world outside , so that their art has an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the silence , which reigned around the advertising for the weap@@ onry - and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give them the campaign which they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic delicate company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the entry with bright colours and animation it will remain stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es from Am@@ nesty .

eight golden rules for living in the student &apos;s homes
eleven years ago I went to a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism . I remember the tense smile of those who upset me - and to the numerous long @-@ voiced complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the crus@@ ade in Chap@@ hab@@ hei@@ me ranges from easily nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to s@@ mu@@ zzle : people describe where you come , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ter , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are said to be honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , I am in my room &apos; .
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it draws the conversation and helps you to figure out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes would rent in fire and these extingu@@ ishers .
allow people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal matches , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and wear their under@@ wear .
in fact , you do not remember to start your university with a relationship
incar@@ cer@@ ated a crude treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many school residen@@ ces are creating a space @-@ to @-@ space storage culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell of someone who tries to relax .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I will continue our friendship , but you have to go away , so that I have to re@@ vo@@ ke the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of knock .
apro@@ pos ank@@ ells : do it .
a guy in my student lives had the idea that a wasn &apos;t closed door an invitation .
he saw some things .
bond with b@@ aking .
as you begin your studies at the peak of the back @-@ mania , the knock is on the doors of people imag@@ ining themselves with a dish of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome from the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve brow@@ sed you a bit . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is also a great way to make friend@@ ships lasting .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends if you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed c@@ low@@ ds from flour , sugar and gre@@ ase also lead to people sleeping when you anchor .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
of course the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking a drop of milk for your tea anyway ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your things , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to kill more well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate she added to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , people from sleep or work stops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just about being an attractive person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl in my hallway asks her neighbors , whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass something quieter , because it was 3 in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they reacted to even with loud music .
when she finally heard about 5 am , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep in two hours before she pl@@ agu@@ ed her own music , she closed her door and went on her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would randomly draw to the same student residence ?
the other way round , it would not be much embarrassing for you to keep a room@@ mate for your future wife . to get involved in it and then you have to see each day and perhaps experience how to get all common friends around you ?
of course the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least to speak to your sub@@ lei@@ gh a little reason .
at the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in its un@@ locked room , is the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bullying , as it appears .
a good stretch is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but get rid of never someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but have to put your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single @-@ appointed , bar@@ ef@@ for@@ ers
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Middle East @-@ Frank@@ fort town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , roughly for refugees - but also as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the righteous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to do this today still cheap and well @-@ based , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are ur@@ ging in the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable living space can be created : he builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or trainers has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part of it here .
in the light of the refugee flow , we need plenty of living space during the next decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ storey framed house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terrac@@ ed house needs the least amount of space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
that is different when you put the people in sitting bricks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residen@@ ces for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the particular needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living per house tot@@ als around 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without a land .
this is out@@ going .
six months took the building .
this is appropriate .
do the construction rules have their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : un@@ objec@@ tion@@ able I have carried out my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the dro@@ ped memory @-@ value special structure and the actu@@ alization order .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it will still be underlined , who created three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me , designs for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but shar@@ per not the competitive struggle for pay@@ able apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we have been a construction boom in Germany over the last five years but have been refurbished luxury apartments that can hardly afford a lot more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the righteous person .
I show , as one can still be able to build a cheap and well @-@ known today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typ@@ ing &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message that k@@ icks the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the issue , users is recommended to either wait until the storm is going back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly be the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by going up the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or being near a charger , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will be continued , as the phone could be switched between half way and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is seeking direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have assembled itself under the man@@ tle of the Social stiftung and opened a new focal point at the Count St@@ auff@@ enberg square .
besides consultations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ square .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ san office was recently opened .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive seniors and advice information on questions such as health insurance or health services and nursing homes .
for years we have been established with our ambul@@ ance treatment service , that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; even many services provided by the insur@@ ers are not likely to be understood , because the complexity of insur@@ ances was hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlady in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , which is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ombud@@ sman , as well as the &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
beside the consultations the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office offers also prevention , health care and wellness .
below the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as helmet , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers of the care centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , fores@@ ight and re@@ hab .
&quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; illustrated Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new qu@@ arti@@ san offices in the city center can see both entrepreneurs as well as demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual urban districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
also , the mayor of Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SD@@ P ) at the opening ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office was also dedicated to the un@@ equi@@ p@@ ation of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ alising &quot; ming@@ ling &quot; . &quot;
in this way , the social foundation , a big contribution , that the elderly can live as independent and well as in their trusted environment .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice in Fel@@ low@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen .
they are also looking forward to Sam@@ t@@ ame @-@ Grand Master Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
doctors were missing in many places in the countryside - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Fel@@ low@@ ausen on October 1 .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ er@@ ausen retired on retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing up with half a site in the coming months .
after a phase of renovation , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St. -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight when the Fel@@ low@@ n@@ ens met with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed her professional tra@@ verse in the den@@ ser hospital and wants to get into practice again .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen and laugh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to pursue their own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families about the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss .
and so one was agreed , the Mü@@ llers also bought the house with practice .
living they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is a two @-@ time family @-@ law Frank Müller also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a primary care in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a leading ambul@@ ance in the district of Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z and is engaged in volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness to bro@@ k@@ hausen .
starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ er@@ ausen worked as a gy@@ nec@@ ologist , his wife has specialised in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both interfer@@ es , want to settle as home@@ work .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copies therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and durability @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euro received the Mü@@ llers as part of a funding program from the District of District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows how proud and pleased that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ ame @-@ leader Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients come to the practice due to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice Fel@@ low@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general public office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice session by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains loud UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , they would have gone .
who visits Dem@@ eter &apos;s consultation , is by the way also still in familiar faces : takes care of the seven medical specialists and the cleaning of the field .
with their par@@ ting par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have been practicing for 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low breaks .
a little sad@@ ness make her feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
your husband will complement , &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed on gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grandchildren and they like to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the border controls will also be high on our south@@ ward , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Interior Minister for Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants a asylum application can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is significant signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the minister said in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , also not via the Austr@@ o @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia aw@@ es &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia itself
the Croatian government had previously told Slovenia &apos;s coming closer ties to Austria and Germany and under circumstances should also build cor@@ ridors for refugees .
but in this way the Interior Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in lay@@ bach , however , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia become rather the supervision of the border - above all to Hungary - intensify . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia had been significantly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area .
like the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants him to turn its borders to refugees but not cr@@ ut@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill up its commitments , otherwise the system may not work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government l@@ acked , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday in East Croatian on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to escape the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
then , according to local media , the police have constantly met new refugees in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mostly around Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , a country with some 4,000 refugees , said the Interior Minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from the press passed to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that were so far pushed to the Hungarian border to Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it is to propose people to go certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the morning , further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night long ago from the island of about 500 km distant from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police declared that we should come hi@@ ther . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this could actually then actually come to the postpon@@ ement of the current Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary towards a slightly further west of the distance .
Croatia : &quot; wide opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , corresponding plans for possible interven@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one ple@@ ad strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been in this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently reported a good testimony to the standards of border controls .
on the French border , there will continue to be 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the news media they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two crossing of Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g continues to be completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to stay on the Croatian border , is not yet unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm optim@@ ally at a local time in Hor@@ gos : he will consider the debates about getting older refugees from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high amount of refugees .
yet one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
helping to protect migrants - dangerous - alternative
however , private Hungarian refugee heroes have already begun to distribute to the refugees , on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ ment area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still un@@ ra@@ zed min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ e@@ aters were sent in the border region .

in this way , the investig@@ ators were killed over a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders can ultimately be captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ators pointed out this action to her 20 @-@ year anniversary and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , therefore we went into the city with the action and went to the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ sic hospital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available to the pas@@ sers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some Pass@@ ant spontaneously attached to the chal@@ k and followed the phrase to stop &quot; my life , &quot; the war stop &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; to read , say , &quot; said phrases like &quot; that far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .

therefore , this public attention to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
however , that everyone wants to communicate publicly in the tablets , be it understandable , after all it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death was still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , thus the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , albeit much in the hosp@@ it@@ ative movement within the last few years that people open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 has been reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit off a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ boat service .
the company said also that she plans to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 employees of the season for the holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to generate 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ press trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than with the earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts are expecting a pol@@ t@@ set of 10,@@ 84 $
the reduced number comes in spite of the increases , which are at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on 4 January and despite higher frequency charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expects that the result will increase from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields when one account the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for the holidays employment were announced one day later than that of the rivals U@@ PS , who plans to stop 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter which ended on August 31st , F@@ ed@@ Ex has earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share amoun@@ ted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research addressed analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks were asked the expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced a decrease in the international level of priorities that were reported to stagn@@ ate sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales at the Bod@@ transfer will rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ security .
the Express @-@ Unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher work costs in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent at a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute move @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table in order to decide if it &apos;s time to tip the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time since almost a decade .
based on them at an end of the produced , two @-@ story seat building is a m@@ ural in the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ob@@ i and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all others .
the central bank has a 2 @-@ fold order of Congress : maximize the U.S. employment and prices here remain stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ released third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be cured from an unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data from the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets can make the cautious F@@ ed @-@ representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal government - and be it only around one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pretext , the interest rate does not increase , the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification , continues to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a raise raise that week .
however , the financial markets expect a withdrawal of the F@@ ed , with a key inde@@ b@@ indicator that only represents a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists lo@@ ges the p@@ unch by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Exhibition was awarded to 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the campaign was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy keeps the sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ av@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic at panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a zinc raise would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate insecurity about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence of 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ag@@ gra@@ vation of the mon@@ et@@ ary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ i had said in the spring and early summer , despite the complaints of the liber@@ als , that it would be more economical than expected , in spite of the complaints of the liber@@ als , an increase in the sentence would expect .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the levels , which the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage inflation has shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually carried out under the annual objective of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and need them on the labour market because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ av@@ en at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world turn up at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage coinci@@ ded in May by more than 16 % below its maximum , as investors feared that slow@@ down the Chinese economy would cr@@ ush global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % below the cup of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influence the complex calculation when you turn the interest rates .
&quot; if events occur on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there &apos;s almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the global economy of the global economy is none of the protagon@@ ists of the F@@ ed so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has grown enormously in recent years .
the mere note of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke at that time in 2013 that the F@@ ed could be &quot; tight expansion &quot; with con@@ stric@@ ting con@@ fu@@ sions around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , it can be expected from the F@@ ed representatives , but also advice on other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Car@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for wealth management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of super@@ actions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , the legitimate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed itself to a interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark for 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limiting recognise effect on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were und@@ one these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee on the interest rate of Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where it is afraid of a interest rate , because the markets were ste@@ aming , &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should hurry the time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
yes , Chinatown
the market / camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

the kitchen ( well and inexpensive ) at this shop is close to the host@@ ages and has several sympathy options .
what it is here : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ au@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
in offering you a warm welcome , not without the involvement of inn@@ umerable volunteer assistance .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ au@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seekers in the city .
some of them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ lic@@ ences I still like to teach .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum see@@ ker at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is a different lesson than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding .
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educate women about how important good nutrition is during the breastfeeding period . it is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies , that is painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that provide babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get in mind their daily cal@@ orie intake by increasing about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet vary in fact the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new am@@ il g@@ ymnasium
the Joint @-@ in Bern@@ ried approved the building for the 2.3 million euros in sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar power .
plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around in the am@@ bar of the sport premises are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent post @-@ council meeting , the implemented struc@@ tu@@ g without large discussions was covered .
prior to this , the panel had also decided to include a application for a division of legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid promotion plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the construction construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle stit@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built up with non @-@ mit@@ tly first and roof @-@ level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the intended use of the umbrella for solar generators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where we get a wonderfully large southern channel , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again it was about the pen@@ ance which is for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan required - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the pen@@ ance of no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ bol@@ ster in the general rule is rather more restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around at the sports centre is a common project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at cost , about 2.3 million euros are being calculated .
grants are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre board@@ room will now be submitted to the District administration .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as director of the Hospital Manager at Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of the people moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this was seen in the astonishing plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed .
a decision on what is said to be the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are to be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the vast majority of sol@@ le with fishermen and the next existing station reloc@@ ated to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , who cannot compete with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites .
the staff were informed about their plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question , whoever continues to follow the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ chner @-@ Wh@@ ites , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inner Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in line @-@ making and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
access to the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board accepts that both houses lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ liance , which still has 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years is finally closed .
until now , the District Court had planned this for 2018 , if the current construction work is completed in the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the board of directors , has opposed to what the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ hau@@ n , in the future , should be used as an accommodation for asylum moti@@ ons .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites could not say , there were several reflections .
at present there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a meeting @-@ psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer via the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a he@@ ater for over 30 years , did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the duties of the physician .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened over and over again in recent decades , and departments were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ etri@@ cs .
the palms of all the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are required today ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) on the Berg@@ ische HC .

hunting case with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two transform@@ ers have been badly injured during their ma@@ is@@ harvest on Tuesday afternoon through shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ is@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au near Pr@@ at@@ au in Witt@@ enberg ) there were several hunters in action , as the police shared .
after a shock they suffered a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man had severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could occur to the accident was unclear .
the det@@ ective police is determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victim of non @-@ violent crime
a Tat@@ ver@@ suspected has led the police to the ly@@ che of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave young people killed and their bodies were cast into a channel in rock@@ in ausen .
one since Saturday missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a non @-@ violent crime to the victim .
the young woman &apos;s cor@@ pse was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in the Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , how the prosecution and police consumed in Wednesday .
as conc@@ our@@ able , one also applies to the Tuesday evening of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who has indeed led the statement and the investig@@ ator led to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missed on Sunday morning after returning home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen was not arranged at home on the eve of a fall feast in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in his search for the young lady , investig@@ ators met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the Friends and the acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the Ver@@ mi@@ est , finally revealed itself a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the pres@@ ump@@ tive perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock@@ in ausen where the cor@@ pse is found .
the margin was issued to the authorities in the police accessories , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old were killed and the cor@@ ks were put in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be performed on Wednesday the Haf@@ hop@@ per , the investig@@ ator put it tot@@ tering .
to provide information about the surrounding circumstances of action should be the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : a study warns against housing
situation in the German housing market is tense .
even more refugees are looking for a pay@@ able stay .
pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution competitions on the German housing market have long been beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with high @-@ income citizens over the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for paid apartments , the 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built up to 2020 every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wel@@ ding residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , more than 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
that with it is missing 14@@ 0.000 dwell@@ ings .
refugees are no longer obliged to live for the first three months of their stay , seeking asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the residential market and ins@@ ed themselves in the long queu@@ es before the flats .
according to statistics in the last year , less than half of all asylum seekers came to rent .
the negative development of the housing market however does not only lie on the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes substantial om@@ is@@ sions in the current housing policy of recent years .
Germany is planned to take a flat deficit , which is increased from year to year .
currently in the urban areas already around 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals were therefore living in meg@@ acities in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
young adults remained no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flu@@ ff in the housing market . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters has decreased in the past years for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the coalition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should stimulate the social housing .
thus , the tax @-@ value tax could be wai@@ ved and the fundamental tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments can be suspended .
in addition , the association &apos;s attractive tax @-@ de@@ preci@@ ation options are needed .
the promotion program for refugee stays from the Staats@@ bank Kf@@ W comes already well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , the approximately 300 million euros was already being called by the Monday night with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are offering corridor
after Hungary , there is practically no rever@@ sibility , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb proc@@ laim@@ s the journey across Slovenia to north no hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage Slovenia itself with neighboring country on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the slo@@ ven@@ ian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there to Europe .
500 people were on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had demol@@ ished its border for refugees on the day of the day .
new laws , which occurred on the same day , make superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police had seized the first refugees on the border of Serbia on border Serbia in Croatia in the morning .
most of them are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you came with the bus and ta@@ xen in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival , she would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come to the border .
this poses other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ off should now be creating a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the shut@@ down the border is no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police dis@@ continued 3@@ 66 .
just before the end of the weekend it had been 9@@ 380 on Monday .
the new Hungarian laws for overcoming and damaging the border tell us as criminal offen@@ se .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the sealed sti@@ pen@@ alties for up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration office , the newly installed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ e@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded on Tuesday in the newly installed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Drink &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of which almost all - 93 - am the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees left .
practically nobody has given no more a prospect for granted asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ tain@@ ted asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to regulate things .
they gathered the trash that caused tens of thousands of people over the last weeks left at the road@@ side .
the fin@@ es have been demol@@ ished and one of the recording boards in the border resort was reconstructed .
none could express themselves for the purpose of this transformation .
Austria is only a few refugees after the shut@@ down of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 displaced people , however , they were still waiting in the country .
about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning to request German authorities .
in open @-@ minded people , smaller groups of refugees meet at walking .
Mayor went on the border to the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the meeting , when suddenly ten people stood with rice at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly un@@ prepared for the refugee flow with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , &quot; says Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the s@@ cour@@ ted together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border to the Near Pass@@ au .
we previously had the un@@ predicted guests once again , with break @-@ ups and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was for us of course , &quot; as a city @-@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him pick up a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inspec@@ tors had risen at the Sunday evening in Wels by one ICE in a regional move towards Pass@@ au in order to give it after the short notice , that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany after the short time , but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train was turned down before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , as previously a two @-@ foot sporty - organised by the Union Wern@@ stein und Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent to us another thousand of mill@@ en@@ nia , is a logical result of a pseudo @-@ holy policy :
instead of being able to help in building the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately on the formation of structures , our German Chancellor grew up un@@ officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the darkness of National Socialism .
suffering of these policies are not only those Austrian who are now facing the bor@@ der@@ lands with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the p@@ oul@@ ders will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited us and welcome , nothing but a further refugee camp is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the surrounding winter , to create decent conditions for prot@@ ections .
and it will be an even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Con@@ rad dealt with the refugee of all hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad , it is used to say that his word has weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ffe@@ isen ban@@ kers in order to frame quot@@ a for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the First Emer@@ gency Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already mentioned Konrad already in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desper@@ ate situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Con@@ rad sales upon a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the He@@ ar year .
in order to meet the number , some 45@@ ,000 homes have to be found in the next weeks - 20@@ 20,000 the countries are supposed to provide 15.000 der Bund .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they have secured this opportunity to do more for the upcoming refugees in Lo@@ dg@@ ings .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supported Konrad .
in the morning there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be trans@@ figured on how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are great expectations of the asylum @-@ coordinator in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels , which are empty during the winter .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards of accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of lap@@ times it could not be that recei@@ vers have to respect a certain height of the hand @-@ holder or the size of the upper duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need of emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful , motivated with his experience .
I am an older gentleman who cannot without further notice the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any cost as they said .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
their own accommodation has not yet been successful .
finally Con@@ rad want to set up a container in Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz demands a better distribution
first , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips , Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as one can assume measures currently without those measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emergen@@ cies , further sites should be checked for their ability .
critic@@ ise the city manager of the distribution of refugees inside the federal state .
here , other areas must make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone case with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ er ( VP ) .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German boundaries will not be rounded off .
the re @-@ leaving of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there will be even the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special cases with refugees after Germany will not give any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the investig@@ ators would not be brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ er for once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria again leads to his borders , is for P@@ ühr@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the General Meeting of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in der Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ er has officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the acquisition of IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must attempt them to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up firms in the new ship@@ yard and later also acquire which to act .
even from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - in which there is much promised . &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1,@@ 7 million euros was invested by S &amp; T in the site of € 3.@@ 3.3 million from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters area in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni envel@@ op opened second shop in the Ar@@ k@@ ade

larger bags and accessories try up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
it was modified several weeks before .
&quot; but I have pushed things out for a long time if I want to open a shop &quot; says broadly .
decisive factors for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ ther@@ more producers that are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has own Italian roots .
your fashion show has been widely placed by her mother to the cradle .
I dive most when something develops and I can show new trends at an performance ratio .
why so many women look at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in such discoura@@ gement , also the Department can not answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ una jes@@ et@@ maker from K@@ all@@ city
the Pf@@ alz An@@ c@@ est@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village whose local ass@@ essor are named .
this property also connects many with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to be .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for discern@@ ment .
whether it is transfer@@ ed to xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists , or knowledge of knowledge in the International crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s candidate in the campaign led power@@ fully up .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate range are her@@ ding .
the New Yorker with the com@@ promis@@ cu@@ is@@ ur is a notion attached to the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the vineyard .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to it by -@@ zig places .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ town in the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ hof Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers think about its aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think people find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the born K@@ all@@ hof has turned a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , which is beside Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; King of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) , too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
he did not put it to the king of the hearts .
while there are respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to feel that Tr@@ ump can be a bit &apos; big mouth &apos; , Wen@@ del says .
random look at the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - zu Plateau : the An@@ ders , she says .
tri@@ b@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ or .
the dump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the US opened a local for Gold@@ min@@ ers .
ground@@ stein of the Real Estate Group were first plot courses in New York .
but the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to his homeland , failed in the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was then belonged .
he did not record tr@@ ump because he once was ch@@ opped without a permit , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is contrast to the mit@@ ones of the descendants .
the had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to inv@@ ade illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ ishing , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was borrowed Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ e@@ gro@@ wer in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ fur@@ tive . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never arranged for K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ amm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz appeared on a visit to something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they make it better , if he did not know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA , they would have been like him , &quot; if he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interest@@ ingly important topics as him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah F@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with € 1.@@ 136 million spectators and attacked the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .

secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ know@@ ingly appear who gets the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , finally , was wrapped in the greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three are , you might have accidentally put an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in a ly@@ ric way on why wood is the perfect man and they named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive outlook as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive Woods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; you might become the answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki run both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noted , I felt they were pretty compatible and I have thought of it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the last visit did last week to make sure that wood is the One .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set to him , &quot; she said .
and when they were asked , to choose to wood , if not they , there was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 clock , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in their move to the US - and there were many other teams to send requests to their impressive open training days at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainers like Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t tournament on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ as@@ ula made his husband and asked Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of accepting his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula draws Hay@@ ne even publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who told him to forget his pat@@ rolled F@@ ang and to worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian rif@@ le for his N@@ FL Debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and told later the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; it was a thing that once occurs , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne hides the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the high refugee pay the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
in the beginning of the F@@ W fall , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned him at the beginning of the F@@ W fall , in front of a heavy crisis to Bay@@ erns Schulen when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools before the collapse &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get ent@@ ang@@ lements in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters dar@@ ed to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
actually , other major topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free voters meetings .
&quot; of course the theme asylum is over@@ lap &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they had been in the nineteenth century during the Nazi war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seekers &apos; asylum seekers do want to push the free voters as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ verter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to act more capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table at large @-@ face town .
a long @-@ long perpet@@ ual den@@ omin@@ ator remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
for the new school year K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Pf@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) at 47 G@@ ymnasi@@ ums will start the pilot project of three to four years - in the result it will last nine years up to high school diploma .
but that goes to Ai@@ wan@@ ger not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all of the upper secondary schools that they want .
free ride at the G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired .

4 people killed , after police kill@@ ings on demonstrators in Nepal shoot
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police kill@@ ings in a crowd @-@ crowd , launched against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the force broke out at the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading city officials said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside of a police station , with some of them stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have char@@ med trou@@ gh and then shot in the air before it resor@@ ted on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known by which it may be used , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate produced .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s more southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of ma@@ dn@@ i say that new provinces they would be made within the proposed new constitution to influence their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal surrounded by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that would like to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been engaged in violent conflicts since the decade .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , has been governed centrally from age for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed in April thousands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution might enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which dump@@ ed to the investors and the management of the secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went from the system construction management board into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors .

that roughly 10 to 12 million euros expensive projects have been under discussion for months .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who came to the meeting were prov@@ oked the images and new details of the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owners and accused member of stakeholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears a number of other project critical that the traffic would increase due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must come all bus @-@ outs , so that Martin Schulz stresses , &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well a h@@ ect@@ are of the former restaurant , is however still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have found a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans will be even more variable .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics can be beneficial for weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes are longer living with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama .
weight loss operations or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years in obesity in treatment of type 2 diabetes were proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ogen@@ ated with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI between 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people who have a BMI over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI , 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach @-@ comp@@ ass and stomach @-@ schooling - for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes among people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those , which have subjected to this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI is in those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately the same with 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , del@@ aying in 36 % of the diabetes condition is totally and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to the type of diabetes , diabetes is completely limited to only one percent and partially at only around 2 per cent .
moreover , the results were in the checks of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also cat@@ ches the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the byp@@ ass surgery group had lost weight more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , reaches greater call@@ ings in BMI ( 7.@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and her@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and have rather a complete overthrow of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show consideration of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine .
in the Swedish study , it was in fat @-@ friendly people who subjected themselves to obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not prove to be an advantage for the survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people suffering from a BMI between 35 , who are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; at an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will wait too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they accumulate these genetic changes that have stuck their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love &apos;s history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently being more attention in fiction : a young woman , attending school times and un@@ sigh@@ tly , will meet after years the flock of her youth again , and he falls in love with her .
so even in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ ses we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond love @-@ history the novel can be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis has been in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indo @-@ Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the permanent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of west European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said .
ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack from September 11 and presented that the violent response by the US drew a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I have expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the road to the solution of this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
pl@@ aster control centers in the US report a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low the alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer such that Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of hand san@@ iti@@ zer to children under 12 years , the pl@@ ot@@ control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming increasingly interested in these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go up in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant to drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
watch videos on YouTube just like young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have only to drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ cured mou@@ th@@ wash to preserve a tougher drink .
younger children can be o@@ cked from attractive ar@@ omas of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zer ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange pe@@ el which are very pleasing for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in children can already lead few sp@@ lash @-@ joints to alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the G@@ s@@ not@@ ing center in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a sip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry smell of the hand san@@ iti@@ zer to school was taken into an emergency room .
their blood @-@ alcohol set was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is applicable to an adult law as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ win@@ man Medical Center outside Car@@ ter@@ Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the ER of emergency .
doctors warned them overnight in a separate children &apos;s clinic on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl fallen through the alcohol and had joined the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and make a hand of hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol poison@@ ing , several dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women killed in Ontario women after the ra@@ vines of hand san@@ iti@@ zer to a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employee of health authorities suspect that the product of meth@@ anol enth@@ uses , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which was noted as a substance .
in January , three students gathered in the fourth class in the state of New York , to po@@ isons their &quot; written &quot; teacher by applying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to pend@@ ulum dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police considered the failed plan as a &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and dis@@ appro@@ fted measures to the authority of the school authorities .

de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador to Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland she won &apos;t show some of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
because the ranking is not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they are talking about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel the same thing - but we must continue .
we really need support from Celtic because that makes the player better .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the UK is going to rise in the UK altogether .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people with no work for the UK as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent , as demonstrated by the Bureau of the National Statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .

why I become a witness to a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
just later today , except in the late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the Death Chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is transmitted by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed that I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists must see exec@@ utions in the US , and as many more applicants are available as places available , a flaw@@ less lottery will be held to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
who is selected will observe it emoti@@ onally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ or@@ ally friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted for me to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma would blame me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
she adm@@ its that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter was present to write .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a repor@@ ters of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts , which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I shall see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter to which you can turn to them for that .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying to die .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him out and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , and threatened to immediately terminate the race .
he referred to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and maintained that she resulted in a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media , he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself has found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt cou@@ ri@@ pper in Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
he had held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to look out like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating out , but sometimes you are frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it is far .
sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
what I want to talk about and I want my owners think I am trying my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Group of integration had tried to pi@@ v@@ ade his cow@@ shed .
&quot; just 18 months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if I am asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables , to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed when trying to grip me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , President of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should that lead me to the view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and maybe makes people responsible abroad for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about this now .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter for me , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the frustr@@ ations levels of the coach have built up along with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw a &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by the preparation of the un@@ loaded Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the Sunday &apos;s total treatment rule was &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse debate , which blow against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has prov@@ oked mud on the leg .
it could have been that night .
it could have been the whole day what it was like that .
and it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the race day . an examination of the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Bell@@ amy fails to fight against rivals for alleg@@ ations of cont@@ en@@ tions
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Bell@@ amy has called critique of the Tac@@ kling of his player as an &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee organizer awarded to the Storm Player &quot; Ring@@ matches &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made an almost hidden note to the Storm team , after winning his team the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ el &apos;s example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland would not be &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentrating only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team said to him confidence , since there was compl@@ aining that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; it passes over and over again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ struggles when she hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have nothing changed on our defensive system or techniques , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ ances for a real emphasis and this has undertaken for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has got a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already com@@ ical , as it passes over and over again at this time of year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy , Ben@@ net &apos;s idea was attacked by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soccer team won . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he had compared his play on Friday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting the game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St. George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team to play and play as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game , which you would like to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as these .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m growing stronger because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster showed a higher result than the game Bron@@ co to Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedules .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet again .
the Storm team is free this weekend as they have the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the last Saturday in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit by drug an@@ kl@@ on
a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his experiment in the possession of 40 kilograms Co@@ ca@@ ine that were ra@@ ided by Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Bundes@@ polic@@ z@@ ei found 100 kg of the drug to the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived in South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August at Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the mor@@ nings and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Pil@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of a drug in a Toyota Ech@@ o .
despite any possibly li@@ pos@@ iting penalty for trying to own a commercial amount Co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there would be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been for an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
in the case of re@@ pris@@ ons the police took place over his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ y explanations of the two people it is clear that the copies of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ agan said .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from having not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian passport , sign up with the police daily and abide by a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request photos of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this slept , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number in@@ decent pictures of children sent to it by another user .
the girl woke later on and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hands of the sle@@ ep@@ y H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it by , found the confusing messages and alar@@ ming immediately their mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research , the terms used in search of im@@ permanent paintings of children .
H@@ og@@ g finally claimed to the officers , that he would have done it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; and he then stressed to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are human beings .
he gave the search on the computer had been carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mble and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the telephone and confron@@ ts the defend@@ ants thereby .
the girl was interviewed and said that the defend@@ ant computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who looked a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty on the charges of the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , issued on 25 January this year , and did not have to be brought to court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
Secretary of Defense S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; was to be found in his disposition .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postponed whether the judgment to October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was admitted in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases in provisional custody .

locks soft on small fron@@ tier crossing to Germany
ever more refugees are driven away from the major check@@ points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad users were allowed from fear of detection and after the people increased to smaller border over@@ sets .
left on the Austrian side , said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police .
along the border river Inn , there were more than 1,000 refugees stuck in Land@@ circles and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were walking on bridges and she@@ dding on the German side .
there they are taken into reception by federal police and rel@@ ayed to the registration .
at Munich &apos;s Main Railway station , according to the German police station , we met again significantly more refugees following the weekend of the weekend .
having arrived alone to 8 : 00 am around 700 people in the state capital , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees arrived the city .
Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of tro@@ pics , &quot; Henry &quot; in the South @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm @-@ pet@@ tes in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm marine air currently underway in the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
the sturdy t@@ oss is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the Tro@@ pics , &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn over the Atlantic over the past few days .
heavy storms and storms are expected mainly in bathing .
according to DW@@ D there is still till Thursday in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ f Al@@ b and in the Lake of Lake with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 km of hour .
therefore , on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 can be noted , especially moving to comp@@ els , which are currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially requested : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were falling outside the U.S. Department ( KBA ) alone in August to this segment .
this is also reflected on IA@@ A ( publications from 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , a lot of new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German Autobahn project is Opel A@@ stra , which will stand in the autumn with the dealers .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the exhibition .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
in order for the volume model also to be sold well , the new A@@ stra does not require much more expensive .
Opel is in view of the biggest competitor VW Golf in view of which at 5@@ 99 euros starts .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
also , the H@@ esse offer another diesel engine and petrol engine of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 horse@@ power , for the first time being a three @-@ cylinder petrol engine .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there are the Opel A@@ stra only as five @-@ fifth .
a second version will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which also has to be seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will new cars have to be applied beside the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competitor in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated active GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ shop wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
thereby the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the design line with its curved lines .
the base model will get a gas engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS , or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 l@@ iter wind bom@@ bed engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is at 170 new@@ ton meters ( N@@ m ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in the spring of 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but all too re@@ done is the shelf @-@ model DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IA@@ A .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n rot@@ or laid out hand in front of the front@@ page : here the fridge was drawn roman@@ tically and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
inside the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by touch@@ screen and used for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IA@@ A , a series of over@@ work@@ ings and new variations like the rac@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Trial Chamber of Justice in a qu@@ orum , given the month &apos;s month in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , de@@ tain@@ ees are generally eligible for financial compensation if they are placed in small cells .
that made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope to judge the judges even if they were imprisoned here a few days in the confined areas ( AZ , 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner , with his constitutional complaints , was successful in Karlsruhe . he was in the Trial Chamber Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell of around five square meters of ground floor ; the res@@ tro@@ om has not been sealed .
after that , the man , who , according to his law , was now back on the free foot in a larger cell .
his representative office because of un@@ worthy defence conditions against the Land of Berlin was failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge took the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and returned to this case for renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of port for compensation would be decisive for compensation would be given an expression , it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality would be stri@@ cken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now damage the amount of the Comp@@ ens@@ ation damage .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge had often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they said only in April of an in@@ mate of damage , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is also a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ subject occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , the in@@ mate of a prisoner , issued an in@@ decent accommodation in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been held twice a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners will therefore always be enclosed in 23 hours , aggres@@ siveness increase , even to bat , it should have been due to the tense situation .
according to information from the judicial re@@ pris@@ als 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of doctoral degree , 19 should be off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are concluded by forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany this year , according to statement by vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what gets to Germany gives you the following overview .
required following different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Labour ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments each year - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatically is the lack of living space but above all in affordable properties : annual 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing dates back out of lease , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments there will also be refugees .
Bundes@@ bau@@ minister@@ ial in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore aiming to double the funding , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much to do is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to arise , and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the scientists and Federal Minister of Finance agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and occupational Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees can be er@@ ased in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help their start , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is vital if they can work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for respecting in the recording company , but also for the self esteem of immigration , says migr@@ atory researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt in Germany it has given a political direction : from the labour market for refugees to recognise work .
while earlier there was an employment ban for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the res@@ idency , the asylum seekers towards a residence .
in society also , because of the skilled workers , it has prevailed in the perspective that refugees should be able to gain more quickly access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market is a lack of German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , there has not yet been an extensive offer of general and occupational @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most common through personal contacts .
the design of networks is therefore according to th@@ rash from the Royal Road to the labour integration .
the Berlin @-@ government has noted that only few fled their children to the kit@@ as , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the roots of roots there is only once very important to hold the family &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ š@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita , the management is distributed in different languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increase dramatically due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the countries , students will be prepared without Germany , in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ suitcase set from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
generally , no federal state of asylum seekers or failed studying the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , indoor and Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) but did not quit his stance .
Studi@@ ed refugees could be facilitated the access to the university .
because refugees with such an occupation or debt shall not receive benefits in accordance with asylum seekers , if they begin studying .
the latter is basically no BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ eligible people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany four years so far to be entitled BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible to be shortened from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but also this funding gap has to be closed , request Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s state Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future Islam is going to play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually admit the same rights in Islam as they have the churches and further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state of religions .
it would be also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes great care of the new arri@@ vals .
the Rights also belong to obligations .
in this way , the representative of Islam must agree to clear contact persons , and be prepared to co @-@ operate with the state in many areas and to dedicate some control possibilities .
this also includes prepar@@ edness , to deal with religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , the religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested that transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a major theme of society in the future .
in doing so it will have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a counter @-@ discrimination place and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it was very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and stakeholders does not , for a long time , call for an international agreement such as the anti @-@ racial enlargement policy , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is capable of providing the previously anticipated refugees , the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns Man@@ or Power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this additional money has to go into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all the arri@@ vals at the same time exp@@ ires in the registration of health care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; performance gains could be rep@@ licated later with the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in the long run , it is highly questionable , so many people can do with the limited amount of catalogue , which see the asylum @-@ performance law .
otherwise , doctors are mostly making the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin scientists of the scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse more educated about their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , must be taken over by interpre@@ ters , she demands .
however , many refugees would have helped many refugees also in the emergency office .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee orders , I complain of significantly more untreated disabilities , and for the young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partially other disease performances German doctors were from their training but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tic or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what affects the nu@@ dity , be possibly even relie@@ ving in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some of them even doctors .
to practice cultivation , they would , however , must show their qualifications and put them again for ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees incoming in Germany depends on estimates of the bund@@ les of payment ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally : most suffer from a post@@ injury @-@ bearing disorder or in depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is ill on a post@@ injury @-@ carrying disorder , suffers from among other things on so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with respiratory not , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death sentences .
further symptoms are in@@ som@@ ing and concentration @-@ disorders , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent that symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic @-@ sick refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
while mentally ill @-@ looking asylum seekers can ask for an application for psycho@@ therapy , however , it usually takes several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices mostly persons or doctors , who are not educated for the mental illness , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this ab@@ duct often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege for dreams
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus proves its way back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , th@@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus takes place in the ring on the brick @-@ h@@ el to day@@ dream .

for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
so the gift of inspiration is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people away from their day @-@ to @-@ day emergency and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old j@@ uni@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city @-@ flair &quot; is the name of Reinhard Pro@@ bst .
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasized Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
abnormalities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst looks also at a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every cu@@ be unit .
the &quot; four @-@ legged artist &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes after the possibility of any desire .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal not feel comfortable , it does not want into a cir@@ cus .

Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe holding wrong talk in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the staircase at the beginning of the year .
he un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly became aware of the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also killed by alleg@@ ations of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous Death threats and warned them before , to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ates .
last month they had b@@ lown him , and interrupted this during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven positions of Op@@ positions and SMS messages have received on their mobile phones who warned them before Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the news comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warn the parliamentary members that the immunity of the parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief spokes@@ person said that the Party of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i guided party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will accommodate up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to grow 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
expected job breakdown leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today is today and we have a wide and deep @-@ depth portfolio of shops that will help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be designed to provide far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to make up electr@@ o @-@ plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was named the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to cope with the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the actions of HP , the world @-@ largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized this Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the major dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had rep@@ lied the last season after a separate papules injury , and then back to its old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; W@@ ger said .
it is a bone that not well healed .
it is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries that he had previously had .
this may be true of a medical view , but as little is recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had had 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als of 157 Lig@@ j@@ ars in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Club who have had most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the inj@@ ure rate during the last season is going to last .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you will have an approxim@@ ate period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win hos@@ tility . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means to start Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with cas@@ ing gi@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Bre@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a small break @-@ up , &quot; W@@ ger said .
although arsen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites , supported by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the biggest intimi@@ dating effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 Games after the &quot; un@@ conqu@@ erable &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where judges were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drag@@ ged the lesson from the last season with the Champions League of capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far hope , with its management the association leading to its first European ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open themselves , now even more doub@@ tful than ever before , as suicide would prove among young men at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ vation ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) will be held in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ rep@@ ie@@ ce in the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms proved that if the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery is doubled .
for those who are not depressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first of all , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media @-@ led communication , focusing on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ vable and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists extr@@ ater@@ al values call ; money , image , social status , all at expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more profound .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was put on .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football spots in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowing that men can refer to it in any case , even if they are often with@@ holding their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone care I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who are depressed and endangered independent , has really clearly shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term wor@@ ship@@ ments .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so highly my objective ou@@ tre@@ ach status over the telephone can also help people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the perfect setting up to the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t you join your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you can see around in Star@@ bu@@ cks just sitting around your own , give him a smile and tell you Hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to cr@@ ush
Angel di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Mus@@ son Cav@@ ani after his finish against Mal@@ mo@@ e .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to advance PS@@ G to Malmö .
here are the play@@ back and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and O@@ son Cav@@ ani kept a course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain des Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s Par@@ stadium on Tuesday started .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head office .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the A group required Paris a strong start to the Swedish master , since they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points it was not a clone of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s pas@@ ar opportunities in front of the gate . he later became in the game against his hometown team and against the club where he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to attract 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents to cause problems and relax while there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won even though I regret we haven &apos;t made one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was rus@@ hed through Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine gel@@ ist went out to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over to Manchester United in the last month , and he interpreted it , why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö &apos;s defense before he completed at Johan Wil@@ and over beautiful in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory this was disappointed .
Malmö , the embedded in a play @-@ off struck , to reach this level , joined the An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which goes far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself had existed , with some ab@@ stain@@ ed and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ z@@ him@@ ovic , who was ste@@ ered at no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he warned a lot more skill than he brought his fellow players to the game and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ z@@ him@@ ovic , which Di Mary turned into a shoot in which he was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second goal finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er had thus reached his sixth year , after I@@ bra@@ z@@ ovic had got a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö can come back to the game , and only an excellent entry of Wil@@ and from the short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could last the end result , before replacement stri@@ fe Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end .
the coach from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later gave to that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league that did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat on front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock purchases
the mining industry resident in Switzerland is concerned with Glen@@ core , who is affected by domestic raw commodity prices , collected on Wednesday 2.5 billion $ due to a share sale as part of its huge plac@@ id plan .
the registered company Glen@@ core compet@@ ed in an explanation that there will be new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion £ 199 to pay his own debts .
the company that has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , struggles with falling raw materials , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and impacts the devastating impact of markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governor &apos;s rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the Glen@@ cor@@ es share price on trade at the early Middle East tomorrow , a rapid increase at the head of the London stock exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share j@@ umped to 2,@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on FT@@ SE 100 index which opened up 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion US share sale as a part of the most comprehensive plans in order to rot@@ ate around one third of its 30 billion debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which amoun@@ ted to a 2.4 % discount on the Tuesday course on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices rose by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping is a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , the White House confirmed the White House in a Declaration on Tuesday .

XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet at Seattle several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .

440 @-@ PS sports car @-@ cars were driving and sc@@ rap

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then played for FC Barcelona .
eight occasions Spanish Master , three times of Po@@ cal@@ ender , four times champion League winners , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer he left 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years of FC Barcelona and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
yet in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now tells that he was already standing before Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; you told me Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says .
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a deal of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ul@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ ers took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man therefore works for the German record company : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken under contract Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great deal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this has led me to war . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 walked with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , switched the red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the royal classes triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in movies
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Afgh@@ an American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said they aren &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as the need for alternative perspectives pointed out , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the elected script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film rather than with the cast of the show , &quot; said Dam@@ on .
brown reacted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of acting by The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown included the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show@@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to call on people to think about it - who will always be the director - like the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown initially .
the only black person , and she is a sh@@ ut@@ te who is beaten up by their white turn .
the producer of De@@ ar White People set themselves for the fin@@ alists by Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on warned that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger above the clip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can tell her diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when the rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ cem@@ an , the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter nationwide effect and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colored con@@ sol@@ ation .
in February the voc@@ alist Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees for the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; record silent &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black lives of Black lives published an explanation , and as a response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ i who will be invited to visit the Pope here in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether it accepted the invitation or has already made the pop@@ e , is unclear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cr@@ ackers First Champion
professional Sport@@ clim@@ bers and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the contest Show , which just ended its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the Fin@@ als .
climbing to the last task , the climbing was part of a 75 foot long hike in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten completed the task at the time when it was the first athlete with the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up doing this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! News following the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the Grand Prize of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live , &quot; said Isaac e ! about his he@@ ap money .
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ters to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten had ended , although he first ended the course at all , not just any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he gets cl@@ ot@@ ted at it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
for the masses of awards , he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by somebody , then I am glad that it was Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just the same if they sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior is extended for an au@@ dition season , the shooting will start in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tigers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday , perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins disappeared one chance to climb within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter of F @-@ Word that was so difficult to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Del@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support when Detroit pun@@ ched three times in the first two Inn@@ es , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and made three of us possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ wh@@ e every game and therefore I want to go deeply into the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Martin@@ ez had 3 matches and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit hit by Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against the Seattle nav@@ y on 6 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has s@@ war@@ med the cover @-@ wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said swe@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at home ( impact training ) , saw clearly better off of the bull@@ wh@@ e , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ us at the end of the seventh schedule the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks got a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy crossed the wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was facing , in front of a ro@@ ok@@ ie R@@ ookie Miguel S@@ ano , who suspended a two @-@ run reverse rotation .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ li to a Double Play .
it was the major league for the first time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ra@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after Detroit added an asset run by the end of the ninth grade , the Wall led a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieving the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed stone however , S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save out .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three appointments in the first two inn@@ ings against the Right Hand @-@ veteran , who had been stro@@ ked before the game of the injury list after having been missing for more than a month after a back pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes sent a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez in playing a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the actors in the scoring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers used on the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .

Ischgl : German military action in Syria
the head of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the dis@@ continued thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &apos; collective note . &quot;
four years ago it was nice that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict moved towards our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive re@@ conditioning for international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany Austria has also introduced national border controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner presented on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , according to Hungary no one will now be sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the issue of an agreement after which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has already given an initial discussion between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers put them not and pointed at talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
there were thousands of refugees in the last days over the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man asks for a special summit on the next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on common action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers will plan to take a new attempt on binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ place and distribution of human beings .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced the late Tuesday evening after nearly four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister in the Berlin office .
Merkel underlined , those people who need protection , de@@ pl@@ ating it as well .
but he who doesn &apos;t have a stake , could not be in Germany .
this view has been expressed in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck in the Balkan route in the meantime .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to also extend the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat extrac@@ ting from Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan to be immediate .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
meanwhile , thousands of migrants were reported on their way to the Greek border with thousands of people on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this concludes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to that , the moon sub@@ mit@@ es easily on its rail round the Ring@@ lev@@ ets .

the researchers present their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to watch out on his lean line is often more likely to fall away from them .
they contain relatively much sugar - particularly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy , the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them they contain B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos are included but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
whoever for@@ gets the fruits supports the immune power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
while purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too tight and pleasant .
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste natural or in sweet dishes .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it reduces the slightly bitter taste of ap@@ shots such as Chic@@ or@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s place
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
on Wednesday , in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday , a far @-@ ninth place in the park was bap@@ tised in the O@@ pp@@ io Hill to the names of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing had been requested by the organisation of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded of Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live for centuries as a minority only in conce@@ al@@ ment of their faith .
in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is evident .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he was aware of the city then as a fall in scap@@ ego@@ ings .
his negative impressions are allowed to record him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther was then initiated with his theses against the bar@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del in the breakdown of the Dutch Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus having the ( pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works painted by the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous images .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his completely personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means t@@ ant@@ amount with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics are customized , that certainly can seem quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt target in his Bible project about three years , for which he made a subjective artistic selection out of the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movements came into cycles , which are related to topics such as cru@@ st@@ as , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and it is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who dealt with the Bible with the scriptures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scriptures chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and so today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into present @-@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of the painting .
it is nestled between the original bi@@ ble of Martin Luther and , each of them , a sentence of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts for the particular situation .
the jewelry band has Golden Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allowed a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ ch@@ y@@ or@@ Order .
&quot; so the education already happened with the Rohr@@ stock &quot; reminds himself in Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work hard to put me back on with the Lord even once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its second concern is to give more importance to art in a fast growing time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today of advertising and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed aside .
artists have a different desire and to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants that the spect@@ ator puts into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to let them appear and to feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post station@@ ed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like , as he understands it with his images . &quot;
I have not counted to grasp the Bible completely , but also selected for it important , also mysterious issues .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ us : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text presents only . &quot; emerged is a ima@@ gery .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ers from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for se@@ ag@@ ger ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
start @-@ up for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company charged , ground@@ ing for a round course : one year later almost all was done - yet still ahead of the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was again the end .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and the management provided for hanging , especially among the residents who did not tolerate the roads .
so hill distant , new place looked for - now with a formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be in October , the first public @-@ in Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now possible to share in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year has not happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be begun without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further mem@@ or@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ F extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundesliga will be a German Bundesliga during the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football respon@@ ds to the mounting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics his help in addressing the standing problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have been this for the greatest challenge of our country since the reunion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one can say in principle nobody knows me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting to get a handle on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany more intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ &apos;s office next Wednesday and I meet the Minister of State of Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and would like to help .
but the decisive course needs to ask politics .
the German soccer league has therefore expanding its refugees &apos; initiative &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach , at the edge of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ er put a clear sign , if there will be on the left touch of tri@@ cot instead of the usual usual sponsor @-@ wall ( Her@@ mes ) for the imprint &quot; We assist - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ y Sport@@ y Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and classified the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every one , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can Bundesliga team , no , we must use our beam , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ess@@ ly Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said from a &quot; prominent &quot; &quot; League of league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fications against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that every 36 license issued in their places had already started , be great .
exactly as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the association will jointly introduce 300 000 Euro to integrate refugees together with the DF@@ B range and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP management team loses an eye in the event of an accident
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye for several reports , according to a fall in the beginning of July .
after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen for a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is nearly blood@@ thir@@ sty , but then tow@@ ed out to the road - that he has told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso E@@ ch@@ ord .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could work out his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Plat@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &apos; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday nights ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president H@@ asso platform , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and USA , since the summer he hadn &apos;t been in the German SAP @-@ headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you please . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Sp@@ ines Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen put an appropriate picture and explained that he suffered the injury , when he was plung@@ ed by the wheel .
it therefore comes with the re @-@ split in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two families of Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without cl@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally sm@@ ashed in the first group play of the Europa League .
the nation @-@ player is also missing the nursery of the soccer league in du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can not fall back to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether speaking on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen will be back again , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem from the spot .
thus , he announced a change on the door @-@ door position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place by Chief keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion .
whether it is used to be Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open .
with high probability , he will also be the second game .
the formal statement by fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ ite would be to be the target for the BV@@ B in the Europa League holds a middle @-@ field Julian f@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ l : government wants the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner in implementing the cars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the will of the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cab@@ inet therefore decided on Wednesday a Strategic paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the IA@@ A of a &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot;
the automated and connected drive will increase traffic safety and look for less stress , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , which will come together with the representatives of the industry on IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Strategic Studies acc@@ entu@@ ates the importance of mobile broad@@ band structure and a considerable rise in digital radio programs .
a test of testing is currently being created on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally for the allowed long @-@ speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the German government also wants to work for a change in the Vienna Convention that represents only the person as a driver .
when driving into automated driving , the car takes over the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly @-@ automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways as far as 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , bo@@ oting vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany are estimated by the authors of the study by 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD Transport Officer S@@ irs Bar@@ to@@ l .
but the liability of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clarified either .
even the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on the AA survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization DE@@ K@@ RA is concluded that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next 10 years , 31 per cent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed held up to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after collecting the digital network battle , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the free@@ way , there could be only 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well , every fourth would be allowed to leave the car under no circumstances .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wa@@ it@@ all@@ ine Cab@@ inet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins that look terri@@ fying thanks to Video@@ projection .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; before it was too ligh@@ tly , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The cat@@ walk &quot; ( From 18 September to the cat@@ walk ) , which was shown from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ kt@@ ops has changed his starting stance on a show over his personality .
he had actually been against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Canada Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ a .
it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the nearly still @-@ looking work of the man , which is written in the fashion &apos;s history , without ever completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was involved .
14 tons of material made the makers according to information of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October was a special delic@@ acy there : a le@@ der@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Te@@ ddy is to be seen in the exhibition too .
he stands for the first , risky fashion work of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted to his Te@@ ddy Be@@ HS and dresses , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him .
he subsequently threw throwing fashion even later .
he st@@ ole mo@@ st@@ umes and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it off course but of course .
he had not tried the mod@@ els for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion designer
previously it went to the long em@@ akers in and around Pl@@ wing around the meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered materials and spi@@ kes were created in large amount for customers , for example , they re@@ worked as to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the che@@ wing fast@@ ening .
instead , the mode is again important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion , fashion has played a larger role , was then sup@@ pressed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
even fine the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode that leans to past stal@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a growing client @-@ potential .
who doesn &apos;t work in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us they already make up half of all orders .
F@@ ra@@ ch Pl@@ wing together with nine other companies , together with nine other companies , is a member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
about 80 percent of sales has been interrupted in the last 15 years .
private trade and business shops are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly ever able to reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass ware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed on chains .
in addition , the export of export , currently after Russia and the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer von der Wer@@ der in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compati@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also relates to the used materials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ berger Company of the West@@ Sax@@ on College Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design can often only be easily varies in order to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ alises the historical snow@@ fall head .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ p had inspired it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the sn@@ ails for their jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure she defines the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the issue of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies us to the USA , Australia and Finland - above all for customers whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ wing and surroundings and who want to make a mem@@ or@@ ab@@ ilia .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be moved , but Disney continues to move to a new movie of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a new extension , but a type of continuation , which is played 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in the times of the world economy crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director stood fast : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes it to open the economy wide for the world
the economy must open up wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should try to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new start @-@ ups and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ i said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to settle the market access , relaxation of border controls , support of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants Mel@@ des@@ ystems .
after the statement , a negative list of neg@@ ativity is identified , which will not come into question for investment .
the system has gradually been tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance because it indicates the market a major role in the disposal of resources , ensuring a legally binding business environment and open the market more open , said the statement .
the government will also attracting controls on the powers entrusted to companies and ensure that businesses decide how they will manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , public controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will provide the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; while maintaining the requirements and the application process will be facilitated .
the right of lawyers to exercise , exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double Mercury @-@ border in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and consumers therefore have a significantly higher dose of nerves .
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is to be the appropriate work paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects imposed on pregnant and inf@@ ant children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt : according to the threshold , the bor@@ der@@ ings of nerve @-@ poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , like shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are raised for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams quot@@ as per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already so heavily loaded with Mercury that , on the basis of the even valid threshold values , some 50 percent of the threads are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be predicted .
in return for this relaxation , the EU intends to increase the threshold values with other fish@@ ings of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram Mercury per kil@@ ogram .
Food@@ watch was but as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller bur@@ ial @-@ fish , like car@@ p are usually so low @-@ loaded that they already stick to the planned peak times already today .
the distr@@ action in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore an per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ action @-@ maneu@@ ver that can only help the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a weight of highly toxic @-@ metal , strongly @-@ gr@@ asp@@ ed strongly about the food chain , especially in predat@@ ors .
the German government is therefore warning that &quot; already small amounts are particularly cause in un@@ born impacts of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Peace explained on his website with regard to the valid high@@ s but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; do not expect to be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal conservation in the environment .
the German coal @-@ fired power stations met according to a written request from the Federal Ministry of Labour to the Green Group , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ u@@ bu@@ ck more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted overall .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; where the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March from the paper .
last year some pan @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system R@@ AS@@ FF .
