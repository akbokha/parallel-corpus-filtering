in ER@@ WA@@ IN retro@@ spective G@@ R@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program agreed on the conference for international economic cooperation , to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled by general resource centre problems .
( C ) It is the purpose of the EEC and the member states that the whole of the Member States shall be bound up within six months of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of force in the form of loan , and the organization will allow it to be possible .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted each other on the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the mi@@ ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in which way it is intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization focuses on a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Offer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; this account is referred to by the organisation as an administrator tra@@ ste@@ e and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ist of the organization .
the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment shall be effected in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic guilt of the Member State , to pay upon request in the currency of the concerned State at the order of the organisation as the administrator of the special transaction accounts and to deposit in the context of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the article on entry into force of this agreement , or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the article to 1 January 1979 or at another time , agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking account of the deadlines for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget .
C ) Any member state can afford to make payments before the above dates .
the car@@ et@@ aker takes preced@@ ence according to the usual procedures of the organisation about dis@@ proportionate draw on the cash or the shoulder to cover the expenditure on the special transaction loan and exclude the special transaction account in a appropriate manner .
the granting of these loans can be guided by the administrator to the terms of the EEC of the following factors :
( III ) to the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of debt relief of the country and its wider credit capacity to the loan conditions without negle@@ ct ; and
VII . the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the concerned countries have to be ruled by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan requires the financing of a clearly defined development programme or project management , regardless of whether it is considered to be the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that will apply to the funds financed by the organization financed and managed , whereby the aim of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be taken into consideration .
the funds of the Special Offer must not be used instead of ord@@ ained resources of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which is bound by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation for a programme or project , which is approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loan granted the same back@@ payment terms , which apply to the organisation &apos;s development loan in general ; they are in charge of ten free @-@ years respectively in 50 years .
special transaction loan will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are reimbur@@ sed in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of these commandments are directly to the organization , which it retains .
any special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given .
the revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses relating to the currency of the recipient or for goods or services that are produced by b@@ z@@ w . provided i ) in developing countries ; members of the organization are and the according to what the administrator has laid down at the time of the loan granted , recipient of a special transaction .

the Parties shall meet all necessary measures to deliver the re@@ agents provided to them by other parties , to deliver all the re@@ agents available to all the input groups .
they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances are referred to in Article 3 recipients quickly and on the shortest possible way .
the parties transmit each other on the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of places that are authorised for issuing the certificate in Article 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these places should be identical with the parties in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeu@@ tical substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe to signing up ; they can be a party by sign ( a ) without the reservation of the ratification or permission .
this agreement enters into force a month after the day when three members of the Council signed it to Article 7 without the reservation of the ratification or approval , or have it ratified or approved .
for every member who signed the Convention later without the reservation of the ratification or approval , or ratified it , it enters into force a month after its signing or the signing of the ratification of the ratification of the ratification of the ratification of the ratification of the ratification or permission of the ratification .

a re@@ agent for blood @-@ group@@ ings must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is the anti@@ body or any other on the label specified substance hom@@ olo@@ g .
a re@@ agent in which recommended by the manufacturer is recommended , thus the following factors or phenomena cannot occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by always renewed understanding of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the title is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carrier , the activity is expressed through time , which is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents in order to be set up @-@ to @-@ date international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity is worked out at the time of standards .
an international standard shape contains according to definition a certain number of national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independently observed by the titles that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ing of most speci@@ f@@ arities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of dil@@ uted in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series , in which a microsc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ings available for the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ ate ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B ) , may be expressed as the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agen@@ at in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 3@@ 01 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is laid under the conditions specified by the manufacturer , its required properties are to be kept for at least one year .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ x form is not at most one year after the last satisfying activity .
this on the label date for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf @-@ attempts ; it is accepted by the state authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of intact gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , in which it is dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent must lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H. his weight , if it is tested for more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
for the prevention of bacterial growth , the relevant state authority can determine that the Re@@ agen@@ z ( or which is added with the dry re@@ agents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tics and / or antibiotic , provided that the Re@@ agen@@ z continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the definition of certain re@@ agents for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents to be colored , should not be stain@@ ed as artificial , at least as long as not until an internation@@ ales Convention has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents to circul@@ ates in such quantities and distribute in such quantities that the re@@ agents are located in a container not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the amount needed in a container must be so great that the content may be used to carry out the effici@@ encies described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ laboratory has over all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to lead to blood @-@ group@@ ed written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents have been kept up so long from laboratory equipment , until some likely to be accepted by some likely that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for the type of re@@ agents may contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective shares in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
every single container is a black on white printed label in English and French to attach the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
