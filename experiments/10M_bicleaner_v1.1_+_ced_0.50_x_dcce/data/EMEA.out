this document is a summary of the European public awareness report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the studies conducted as the Committee for Human@@ otherapy ( CH@@ MP ) conducted in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please refer to the P@@ PA@@ R package ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ t@@ table ( tablets that can solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for saving ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ ulating ; • Bi@@ ob@@ i @-@ disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients some man@@ ic episodes ( periods of normal high @-@ tuning ) have alternating with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy becomes the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection @-@ solution is used for quick control of tigh@@ ter anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , when the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases the solution for storing or the mel@@ t@@ table in patients can be applied to swal@@ lowing the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene probably appears above all as a &quot; partial ag@@ onists &quot; for the recept@@ ors of neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tus amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tus and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent appears as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tus deficiency play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ anist carries out to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and to prevent their re@@ occurrence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy that prevent re@@ formation of symptoms , has been studied in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to the un@@ treated anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study Abi@@ li@@ fy about twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent re @-@ occur in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was carried out in a study on 3@@ 01 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered an un@@ disturbed break with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( an other anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients asking for the treatment .
the company also conducted studies by investig@@ ating how the body absor@@ bs the mel@@ t@@ table and the solution to decrease res@@ or@@ ted .
in the two studies with the injection solution shown patients , the Abi@@ li@@ fy patients in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significant increase in symptoms of un@@ disturbed anxiety as the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re @-@ act man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of irrit@@ ated anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ at .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for freezing ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( in@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness ) , som@@ atic , nau@@ se@@ ep@@ tion ( con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , ruin ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy for treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly managed episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes relate to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection @-@ solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ al @-@ I @-@ disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate from the risks .
June 2004 gathered the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate @-@ heavy episodes of Bi@@ bi @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displayed mostly of man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an average dose of 15 mg / day one day regardless of the meals .
an increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ ans disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is canc@@ eled from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ izi@@ er behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased dis@@ infection risk with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene in comparison to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ ep@@ hod should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) , cereb@@ ral disorders , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ uted for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene ( dy@@ nasty ) .
if in case of an A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y @-@ treated patients signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ l@@ itter should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms which pointed out on a m@@ ns , or impro@@ per high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , have to be replaced .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ant cases should be in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are related to cr@@ amp@@ ant cases with caution .
56 - 99 years ) associated with Ari@@ pi@@ ke in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene , an increased mortality compared to placebo .
there was however in one of these studies , a study involving Fi@@ x@@ er dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cereb@@ ral events with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebo@@ x or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events associated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of the glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally associated with schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ entities , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines is taken with over@@ bearing side effects such as Se@@ dierung ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ o@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ p@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene , though this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy testing , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene in order to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing , the common application can result with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ benzene ( compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism ) .
if you consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ protein inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dosage should be raised from A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the dosage height prior to the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ genital op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ els concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ benzene per day does not show any significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ s@@ benzene ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should get out to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ast@@ benzene .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety during human beings and due to the concerns in the reproduction studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits jus@@ ti@@ fies , clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics the patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ s@@ wan has no negative influence on them .

the efficacy of the my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , which took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received an anth@@ racycl@@ ine earlier .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( all@@ u@@ pro@@ abe or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication related to conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicine .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs as such as the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients showed themselves in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
it must also not be applied in patients who have the breast@@ feeding or prior to the treatment of low neut@@ ron numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic drug ( CH@@ MP ) proved that the first treatment is no longer suggests , effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines could not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission appointed the company solven@@ cy Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of marketing of my@@ x@@ ane across the European Union .
my@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ cardi@@ ac in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and is not shown for the standard anth@@ racycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neutr@@ ro@@ disease ( neut@@ ron ) &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy during the my@@ x@@ ane therapy the dosage should be reduced in the subsequent series on 220 mg / m2 .
in sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 the treatment is to be broken up until a bet@@ tering on degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
my@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to non @-@ sufficient data on imm@@ ort@@ ality and effectiveness .
abra@@ sion is an album @-@ in nan@@ op@@ arti@@ formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have substantially more pharmac@@ ological features than other formulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be ab@@ used immediately and should be used for symptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient should not be treated again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , there should be no renewed abra@@ sion treatment cycles until the neutr@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ code increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again on &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver li@@ dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sion .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules which promotes the assemb@@ ling of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ail@@ ers and stabili@@ ze the micro @-@ ub@@ uli by im@@ itation of their land@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ eli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ recept@@ or and due to the inc@@ umin@@ ous prot@@ agonist SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic Rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ atic cardi@@ oma is treated by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ sided studies and 4@@ 54 patients which were treated in a random@@ ised phase III @-@ comparative study .
in a study 43 patients treated with metastatic Mam@@ cardi@@ ac in a study which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was conducted in patients with metastatic M@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of soluble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ indication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medi@@ an ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had a handicapped general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy before , 27 % had only an adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and the adjuv@@ ant treatment .

the middle distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or past@@ as connection of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with the values after a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ designed p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the my@@ x@@ ane P@@ ac@@ lit@@ el injection ( 43 % ) than after a solution @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at my@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human@@ ized liver microsc@@ opes and tissues will be reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily reported to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that ab@@ uses a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal hem@@ or@@ isation , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if prior to the procedure a self @-@ blood circulation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with se@@ ab@@ ed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that will display the medicine .
in case of patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ ha@@ bre@@ d one is se@@ amed in a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor if they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the tick @-@ levels should always be in recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron gel exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems a an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby , that the body does not have sufficient to speak on the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from a number of kidney problems , compared to reference phar@@ ma .
all participating in this study , at least eight weeks was E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein , before they were turned to se@@ ab@@ ed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the variation of the hem@@ ost@@ bell levels between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also placed the results of a study before , in which the effects of under the skin @-@ bla@@ sted se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ eo@@ bin@@ ed values were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients showed up to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ war@@ dly head@@ ache and confusion .
se@@ ab@@ ed must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of other components .
se@@ ab@@ ed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that for se@@ ab@@ ed according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

an@@ a@@ ics and fol@@ lic@@ ences may vary depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore assessing the individual clinical trials and disease symptoms are required by the doctor .
a rise in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in around more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individually @-@ mo@@ ck@@ bin@@ ed values over or below the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ bin@@ - target concentration .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ op@@ ause and for men .
it is applied in patients with a high fac@@ tive risk ( bone @-@ bur@@ sts ) , including those who suffered a s@@ ung@@ mati@@ cal hip break@@ age like in passing ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the touch , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients should have at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip pre@@ fecture should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pe@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was attracted to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was evaluated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures for three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip pre@@ fecture , and the number of frac@@ tures took place over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me which builds a bone substance ) in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the value value .
in the study with older women the risk of fluid frac@@ tures under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced about a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip pre@@ fecture , 9 % of patients were under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all the bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of kidney reactions , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clarification material for physicians to pres@@ cribe the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as the medication contains , as well as similar material for patients , in which the effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended for intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally it is very advisable to make in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by G@@ abe amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney functioning ( see Section 4.4 ) In case of patients with a credit in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination among older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , as data is missing for imp@@ unity and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences are available .
an existing mort@@ al@@ a@@ emia is at the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid entry of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bon@@ ing construction , a temporary hypo@@ critical hypo@@ the@@ emia can be developed , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
additionally it is very advisable to make in patients with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary amount of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor mouth hygiene ) should be judged before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental access , there are no data available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate is reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral area .
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by G@@ abe amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of prec@@ ari@@ fication was obtained in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of Vor@@ hoff@@ tees between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2.3 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted resi@@ dual effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney @-@ functioning bon@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which is considered as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as ac@@ claimed kidney failure , associated with .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years comparable between the ast@@ o@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after G@@ abe has been observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the rating of the laboratory sound , the temporary calcium values occurred at 2.4 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials treated patients .
all patients received comple@@ mentary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recently exp@@ ired hip , the vitamin D @-@ Spiegel were not rout@@ in@@ ely tested , but the majority of patients received an Initi@@ al dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the J@@ aw region occasionally was used , mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the J@@ aw area ) , who were treated with Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid .

the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , increasing the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and at 4,@@ 3 % on the face of the shaft .
clinical effectiveness at males In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures for men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on placebo .
in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) was once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the first weekly basis of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at applied to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ck A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients aged over 30 years ago with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all ligh@@ tened up to moderate mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of Kno@@ ck studied ( mean Ser@@ um @-@ Spiegel of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ 5,@@ 0 up to 3,@@ 0@@ 3@@ age @-@ specific top level of inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months of compar@@ isons .
in the combined results , after 6 months a similar acceptance of pain intensity and pain control was observed compared to the raw value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a Res@@ p@@ onder at the end of the six month ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
by the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the post @-@ observation study , the therapeutic approach could be kept in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , in a middle duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .

the summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the studies conducted as the Committee for Human@@ otherapy ( CH@@ MP ) conducted in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mono@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abolic drug ) cannot be displayed . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abolic disease ( dual treatment ) .
it may additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ overweight patients ) which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest compatibility dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl est@@ ant or ins@@ ulin can be maintained in the beginning of Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl est@@ ant or ins@@ ulin is to be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s physical ins@@ ulin is better to be used and the blood sugar level reduces that type @-@ 2 diabetes is better adjustable .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either from Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies , concentration was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible that the blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered when applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl @-@ values showed up to 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , where the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 2@@ 89 patients was examined , patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin took up , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients requiring additional placebo .
the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and mort@@ gage ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ priced ( allergic ) towards Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebo@@ x ( high ket@@ one mirror - saw in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in patients is to serve in which met@@ form@@ in does not appear .
October 2000 , the European Commission distributed to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited by Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the trans@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown in combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ances is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced kar@@ mic reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and ec@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ rov@@ as illness was performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality rate .
in patients with increased input cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x limit of standard @-@ range ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to the 3 @-@ number of the limit of the standard @-@ range are increased , the liver chan@@ ym@@ s are used to control again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops , point out to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , th@@ igh@@ tening , ti@@ ghtness and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver li@@ ym@@ outh to check .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be diver@@ ted up to the preliminary parameters of clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven of fat deposits , and in some cases associated with a hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a tick @-@ screen , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slightly reduced reduction in the medium @-@ level volumes ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in a comparative study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in to 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in around 1 @-@ 2 % and of the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ular to 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity to patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ o @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , reported on a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ ary with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct relation between ing@@ es@@ tion of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ ary if patient notices on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of announcements of unwanted events related to bone , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture was 1.1 freight for@@ tifications per 100 patient @-@ years in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a similar medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a similar medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see Section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are li@@ zed from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) , in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 54 % .
this is attributable to that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the pregnancy hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother &apos;s body and thus reduce the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the killing growth .

in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on played AL@@ T an@@ sti@@ ege over the triple of the limit of the standard @-@ range , often on how to placebo , more rare than in compar@@ isons under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl hard@@ wood .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ economic disease infection was the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the market launch has rarely reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it became a summary analysis of announcements of unwanted events related to bone , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients with comparative @-@ related groups .
in the period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.6 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a similar medication .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tiveness of liver , obesity and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on increases the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral of glu@@ cose in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to study the time until the descendants of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.2 % after the first 6 treatment month ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy started a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ at survey over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who remain only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical studies about one year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on cat@@ ches a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based on 18 weeks of investigations on type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the overall ser@@ um tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values have been observed .
in a study of 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both for an effect on the gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ovascular age study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ rov@@ as illness were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the peak concentration on un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours to use .
on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ i@@ fied Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the human being the marker was mainly found in the barrel ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites lies 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma @-@ concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy proportions , but resem@@ ble the rates of the or@@ ical clearing of the mother sub@@ stance .
in to@@ xi@@ c@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys constitu@@ ent after repeated appointments , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is attributable to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the creation of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ri@@ eres and thus reduce the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for low @-@ killing growth .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane has been studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration was measured ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane might need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package fee ) .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes also predomin@@ ate over the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission appointed the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane in the entire European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is required along with a longer lasting effect .

patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved for example by an intense ins@@ ulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warnings and should be advised accordingly .
every change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , Human@@ ins@@ ulin or In@@ sul@@ in@@ an@@ alo@@ gon ) and / or manufacture method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to ins@@ ulin origin ) can result in a change in dosage .
if switching to Ac@@ tr@@ af@@ ane is required when a dosage adjustment is required , it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients requiring hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal based on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early war@@ n@@ symptoms are less pronounced or otherwise compared with their previous ins@@ ulin .
travelling to over multiple time zones , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician since such travel can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients with other medicines .

if the ur@@ inary label is still about 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose may be increased at once a daily 120 mg .
during the first treatment months , there are still any po@@ isons occurring ; therefore , patients are advised at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ins .
the drug is not recommended in children and patients who had a transplan@@ tation because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness was compared between different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to one placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses from Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary seals was found in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 2@@ 62 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg revenue , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once daily 120 mg income , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary seal in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was by 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and on none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal li@@ abilities .
especially in patients with heart attack in pre@@ history , there may also be increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic in the blood of the ur@@ inary tract was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also be a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and tox@@ ics .
the primary efficacy point was in every study the proportion of patients , in which the last three months were referred to certain ser@@ um har@@ sh@@ esp@@ ace size &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ ene / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 5@@ 67 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ox at the start of study from &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX study showed significant significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed with regard to the permanent reduction of ser@@ um har@@ rowing under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the standard used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering of Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sec@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ - &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functionality The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness at 40 patients with kidney functionality ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration at Pro@@ ban@@ den , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ O@@ - and F@@ act study ) had taken up a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data gathered in the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the incidence of tox@@ ic@@ ation has been revealed , so that less than 3 % of patients required in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a g@@ ull required ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a g@@ ull ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the gyp@@ sy@@ no@@ dal size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of tox@@ ic@@ ates up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.6 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.6 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at healthy sh@@ ban@@ den increased the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation period @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multi@@ pler doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C is observed that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ cent increase .
after taking easier or multi @-@ pl@@ ers from 80 to 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max . 2.@@ 8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration is observed , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range of 29 to 75 l of intake doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human life @-@ microsc@@ opy showed that this oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ rop@@ cur@@ oni@@ d is mainly generated by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg total dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ i@@ xed F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at found themselves about 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ changing f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine also found about 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patients groups kidney failure after taking multiple sclerosis doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , medium @-@ heavy or severe kidney failure changed the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to test with normal kidney function .
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ , from h / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ , from h / ml in the group with severe ni@@ b@@ ys@@ function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror is made .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or storing other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first intake of the day , which is supposed to take no earlier than 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicinal products that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , smaller ( 11 % ) than with those who only income Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at revenue ( 32 % ) .
the company also placed data on which the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dosage contained exactly the dose which is needed for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive system , dy@@ sp@@ lash ( blood vessels ) , c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ence ( digestive disorders ) , c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ence ( hi@@ cer@@ ation ) , infl@@ ated ab@@ dom@@ es ( born stomach ) as well as su@@ ction cups .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ al hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of other components must not be applied at AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or invitation of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following notes are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed the tablet with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not cr@@ ush the tablet or the tablet into the mouth , because a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ de@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ oms , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cor@@ ders , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially , these severe and required one hospital date ) .
the doctor is therefore supposed to point out attention to all signs and symptoms which should point out on possible le@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out , at the appearance of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , pain , or retro@@ active pain , or new or opt @-@ lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ bri@@ mming the drugs and solic@@ ited medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not able to take properly and / or refer to the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ages are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ phase clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk has been determined , were rare ( to market launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose from the j@@ aw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy is primarily associated with intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ outs of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reducing the risk of a oste@@ on@@ cology rose by the j@@ aw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted that they should take the tablet into the next morning after having noticed a dosage in the next morning after having noticed their failures .
they should not take two tablets on the same day but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned for the week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the minerals metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ ic re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid , and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific Inter@@ action studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for application for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applied in the case of pregnant women or nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy that recognize embryonic / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development .

in this study the daily tick of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption referred to a intraven@@ ous reference to a intraven@@ ous bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at women 0.@@ 64 % for cans between 5 and 70 mg after warm fasting and two hours before recording a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability rose accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been taken one or half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
at healthy proportions , the Gift of or@@ alem pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in funding in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies of rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is split according to intraven@@ ous gift from 1 mg / kg , but then quickly changed into the bones or retired from the urine .
exhau@@ st After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , about 50 % of radio@@ active , substance within 72 hours with the urine retired and little or no radio@@ activity was re@@ found in the thread .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing is not advanced 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is eliminated with r@@ amp@@ re or al@@ kal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it influences the ex@@ cre@@ ment of other medicines by this means of transport .

characteristics at patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , which is not exp@@ elled in the bones , quickly over the urine is eliminated .
although there is no clinical data in it , nonetheless , to reck@@ on that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as well as in veterin@@ arians also try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function is a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ oc@@ raf is administered for adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver , to prevent a rep@@ ulsion of the transplan@@ ts by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients were presented with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf had been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was gra@@ ded after a treatment duration of one year ( by looking for example , as often a renewed organ@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were conducted with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Adv@@ ag@@ raf is added to the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
Tre@@ mor ( tre@@ aches ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , elevated blood sugar level ( hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased pot@@ assi@@ um content of blood ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ al hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of other components must not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicine should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ raf as the Adv@@ enti@@ er dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant shock absorption or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; implementation of the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should be made only under the nar@@ row@@ ly control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of exhau@@ sts and compatibility with blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us pipe should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as a se@@ mirror , with both formulations both in Ni@@ er@@ or and le@@ ased patients comparable .
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure proper substance exposure to the immediate re@@ plac@@ ment phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ enti@@ er Dos@@ is@@ aker can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .
if the condition of the patient is allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) will be initiated using a dosage of ca .
the duration of the application to the suppression of transplan@@ tion must be maintained ; consequ@@ ent can therefore not be specified as a maximum duration of the oral therapy .
dosage recommendations - low @-@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily g@@ abe in the morning .
additional dosage adjustment can be required later since the Phar@@ o@@ co@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the process of stabil@@ isation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily g@@ abe in the morning .
dosage adjustment - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be asked for a daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ bal@@ f capsules , thus this shift in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the entire daily dose .
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants at Adv@@ ag@@ raf once a day the treatment must start with the treatment in Ni@@ er@@ en- and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant initi@@ als for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant .
heart transplan@@ tation When adult patients , which are asked to an Adv@@ oc@@ raf is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ cases are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ cin@@ as@@ - and color@@ ectal patients , came in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patients groups with reduced liver function to maintain blood cells in the desired area can be necessary in patients with severe liver li@@ minal disorders required for a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no influence on the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ical potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , is recommended a me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um surface level , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ates and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf In the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ - to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the bottom mirror in the full @-@ bloo@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of precip@@ itation and compatibility in the individual case under the helpl@@ ess of full @-@ bloo@@ dies@@ t @-@ pipe checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during the treatment therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in the actual use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorou@@ gh@@ bre@@ d blood ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the decline in the blood has not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with se@@ cul@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and cardi@@ op@@ sy @-@ receivers have usually been used blood concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe und@@ es@@ irable events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant sho@@ ots or other side effects , which can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; implementation of the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should be made only under the nar@@ row@@ ly control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant , which proved to be compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ellers , are not yet given any clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded wording .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tion at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ting receivers in the chin @-@ age there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
due to possible interactions , which may lead to a removal of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and an de@@ preci@@ ation of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant @-@ cured during a treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances may be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ ac opath@@ y and observe chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
more factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ici@@ dal disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ tical ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation fees and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ellers , the influ@@ x of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for Pr@@ es such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness condition , cl@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , should a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf tungsten capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ pl@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ ay special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can impact the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus raising the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advised to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels while maintaining substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain constant concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a very pronounced interplay has been made with anti @-@ dy@@ ko@@ tics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ect ( z ) .
Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies have assumed that the increase in blood levels is primarily from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
Hoch@@ do@@ si@@ fied Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute absorption re@@ actions can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .

advance is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood @-@ ray disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application shall depend on whether an Adv@@ ance used to treat ble@@ eding or prevent ble@@ eding in surgical interventions .
patients with h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes blood @-@ minded problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which it contributes to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
advance is one another in the European Union approved medicines called Re@@ qu@@ ads , similar , but is otherwise made , so that the medicine does not contain proteins and animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate sal@@ ari@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medication was examined as well as surgical interventions .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ates in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ ts was rated with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( watched at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advance must not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission appointed B@@ x@@ ter AG to approve Roche &apos;s marketing authorisation in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII lack , according to the location and extent of the ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ tic events the factor VIII activity is not intended to sink in the corresponding period in the corresponding period ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is over .
during the treatment process , the inj@@ ector is used to control the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determining factor VIII @-@ plastic .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis in long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to assign a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the appointments must be made after the patient , whereby maximum inj@@ ections of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ian activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ position stage depends on the largest and by genetic and other factors .

the A@@ DR@@ s used by the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to the factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which all appear before un@@ treated patients , which have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and sh@@ ing@@ rays ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation has still been evaluated so positively , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation should request a further extension for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic means ( CH@@ MP ) officially admitted that the company assumes its application for the marketing of an Adv@@ oc@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues which connects other structures in the body , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) .
it is a type of virus that has changed gene@@ tically so that there can be an gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was so changed , that there cannot be copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that is formed from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body @-@ 53 @-@ Gen , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , at which the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study with a patient prior to Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the review of initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP issued a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion was not enough that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors has advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medication in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not been sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who are coming in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the returning consequences for patients , currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance fre@@ eing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so comp@@ lied that one of the effective components are released immediately and the other slowly is released over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy against pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ op@@ per nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is taken twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ti@@ ped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be succ@@ ul@@ led to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main exercises were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ the@@ u@@ pf@@ a@@ ymp@@ h atoms , which were reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all gras@@ ps of the nose , the patients , the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze increases the patients , the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze revenues , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a was viewed , the patients showed under the aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze a lens of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ im ( heart chase ) , oral dr@@ ush , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be in@@ sensitive to patients who may potentially over@@ har@@ dy ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ces agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ kel@@ etal ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid ) or even a hem@@ ost@@ y stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break down or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the failure of data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after passing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of time to 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease .
after decrease the swelling of the v@@ eils in the upper air@@ ways the treatment may be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ sted in patients who are treated with mono@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , respectively within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ tic activity in combin@@ ated application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , l@@ ac@@ om@@ atic , Cab@@ erg@@ y@@ an@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Ep@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ o@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient collective , and the data does not suff@@ ice to speak appropriate recommendations to d@@ osing .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver li@@ tigation and the data are not enough to address the appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment at occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ or or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be set .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , are recommended to be careful : • patients with digital rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ my@@ ard in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ sters or bronze @-@ gro@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , because Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin transactions or reduce to their extent .
in the context of clinical tests with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however no sound@@ pro@@ oral inter@@ dependen@@ cies or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences between the associated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzy@@ me of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drugs C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 did not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ c@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of the application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency on the normal population .
as reproductive studies not always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ory characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it can come in very rare cases to a ben@@ evol@@ ence which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the transport or the ability to use machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( Se@@ dierung , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ulsion ) with possible let@@ ins .
head@@ aches , anxiety , frigh@@ tening , anxiety , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , excitement , breathing , per@@ sever@@ ance , nau@@ sea , sor@@ eness , sor@@ row@@ ness , t@@ inn@@ y , t@@ inn@@ y , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension .
a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ br@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , door@@ way , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ curing c@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es a as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
in an individual dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluid , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks associated with the barrel .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg once daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ ness in comparison to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further person@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ arm or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
we took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ id effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall ts@@ cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ es@@ kin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the bott@@ ling effects , determined by the nose mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than among a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups .
in the context of a single @-@ dose @-@ study of the Aer@@ ob@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .

within the framework of a pharmac@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ student study , which was performed with the formulation as tablet at healthy adult Pro@@ ban@@ den , has been established that four Pro@@ ban@@ den des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly affected .

the effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency at the day ) before and after six @-@ month treatment .
there were further studies presented to prove that the body is able to take the sy@@ rup , the solution to freezing and the mel@@ ting tables in the same way , as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused the results of all studies have been taken , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symptoms after six @-@ month treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % with patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission appointed the company SP Europe for the marketing of marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in youths from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ connected rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease progression and may end after lowering the symptoms and will be res@@ umed when re@@ occur .
in the Persian @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during the intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effects of alcohol is not enhanced ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it can come in very rare cases to gasoline , which may result in impair@@ ment of the transport or the ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , have been reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most commonly imp@@ aired side effects , reported on the more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side of side head@@ aches , these entered into 5,@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ curing c@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es a as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dos@@ ed up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ di@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered for over ten days , showed no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
with an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluid , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks associated with the barrel .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ end@@ flu@@ ence and redness of the eyes and it@@ ch at the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ edly allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and Persian @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ edly allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall result of the fra@@ gment of quality of life at Rhino con@@ jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was acting for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physiological ology is similar to the ae@@ ti@@ ology at different shapes and chron@@ ically patients can be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated .
since the H@@ ist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ est@@ al is a responsible factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected in other forms of pri@@ me@@ aria to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effectively in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dosage .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not respond to Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and vig@@ or considerably , as was measured by a 4 @-@ points scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmaceutical ev@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ population , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Cum@@ ulation after a once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , that for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bles , however , has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drugs C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 did not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ c@@ rot@@ eins .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was in@@ consistent with simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ performance effects of alcohol is not enhanced ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ me@@ aria , reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than with patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study conducted in adults and juven@@ iles , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) were not observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be logged in adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ di@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults showed no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers , there was no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
with an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg introduced A@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and young people in clinical trials at no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults it came through the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of the alcohol @-@ in@@ duced power imp@@ aired , nor to an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched that the company adop@@ ts its application for authorisation for domestic H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a grip heating system breaks off when a new tribe emerges from the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained the elements contained in the vaccine being contained in the vaccine as &quot; body est@@ ran@@ d &quot; and is antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a flu @-@ virus of this pedi@@ ms faster .
subsequently , the envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a body est@@ ran@@ d ) and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine is not to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years involving human immune immune virus by type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is causing the acquired Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is at disposal as a solution to boarding , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered if the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral medicines has previously been taken in the patient , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has judged that the virus is addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aging is based on body weight .
a@@ es@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adult men who were previously not treated with Prot@@ ected Cham@@ bers .
this with low do@@ si@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had been taken earlier as a release , with other prot@@ ections .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ substanti@@ ated concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change in the virus last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prototype , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than among placebo , but e@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children of reduced per@@ v@@ ase also the Vir@@ t@@ last , however , of the children that were treated earlier with Prot@@ ected Cham@@ bers , were only very few of the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ected Cham@@ bers , which were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ections :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ections , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks than with the patients who are continuing to increase their previous prototype :
the most common side effects of ag@@ asy ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ aged avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied to patients , the cur@@ rants are used ( herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines which are just as dis@@ rup@@ ting and are harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health .
as with other medicines to HIV , the a@@ gener@@ acy is taking the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ cular phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected adult and children over four years face the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers , but the committee fixed that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prototype , not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission appointed the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited by approval for the market entry into the entire European Union .
A@@ generative is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , Prot@@ ective @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered from Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than from Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ph@@ adding ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ aged avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of 2400 mg , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceuticals , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ections were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the loss of data to in@@ adequ@@ acy and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is supposed to be done in patients with slight or even liver li@@ tigation with caution , in patients with severe liver li@@ tigation it is contra@@ sted ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicinal products that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk reduction of plasma vol@@ tages and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r during ing@@ ra@@ de@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral compromise therapy , have an increased risk for heavy duty effects associated with potentially deadly conditions .
for the event of simultaneous treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the specialized information of these drugs .
patients with pre @-@ existing restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver li@@ dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral compromise therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ cose metabolism is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of treatment weighs the risk system@@ ically corro@@ sive effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ sore and Supp@@ ression of the secondary function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an equ@@ alization of a@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ulators Ratio ) , methods for determining the active concentration of nutrients are available .
in patients who take these drugs simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plastic tiles of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of toxicity , due to the high output of toxicity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ding of the a@@ gener@@ ase solution to take , this intestinal form is contra@@ sted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be ab@@ used in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ rac@@ ers , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exception by an existing Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy drugs were required , associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addi@@ ctive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ections , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous comm@@ ut@@ ations and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ ws .
HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to serious clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tical ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ oses , higher body mass index ) , reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral compromise therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width a@@ es@@ ase can not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with pharmaceuticals , whose active substances are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated to the elevated plas@@ modi@@ ties with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in trying to cut the reduced plastic plate by a dosage increase of other prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently seen unwanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taken into Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort , the Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r@@ st mirror , and , if possible , the Vir@@ us@@ last to review and expose the cur@@ rants .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast to 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ aged avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ r have been applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of r@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) have been reached ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a nar@@ row@@ ly monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ is , however , due to the viol@@ a component of Di@@ dan@@ is , however , is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least an hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , with G@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ is@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ is@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ rac@@ ers would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ections and available limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r may be sen@@ sed .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic .
if these medicines will be applied together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be done as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine @-@ associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becoming a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose although there is no clinical data to exist .
pharmaceutical companies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plas@@ m@@ ity of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous arrangement .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that can be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or , or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ esthe@@ ase , possibly to conduct interactions .
patients should therefore be focused on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prototype , it is advisable that an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ esthe@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ p@@ tions@@ .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants that are known as enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r may lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ tic@@ hor@@ as .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ o@@ pin , pine @-@ pin , pine @-@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ bb@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
simultaneous ing@@ esting with a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ric , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ gangs , climbed up the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ plastic tiles significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by about 86 % ( 90 % consistency interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of treatment weighs the risk system@@ ically cor@@ tical @-@ co@@ tic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose con@@ dens@@ ation is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of the plas@@ m@@ ity with simultaneous administration of e@@ gener@@ ase .
da plasma cutting levels of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended by am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by con@@ jun@@ k ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied together with oral inj@@ ectable mi@@ da@@ i ( see Section 4.3 ) , while the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ kin must be treated with caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in the plas@@ m@@ ity of Mi@@ da@@ zz@@ am around the 3 to 4 fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per small reliability of historical compar@@ isons , currently no recommendation is given as the am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the current case of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a mi@@ tigation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ po@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .

the invali@@ dity of a@@ or@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side @-@ related side @-@ related side effects were lightweight to moderate , occurred early on and led rarely to the treatment of treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether in connection with the intake of e@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously to tackle HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ ected Cham@@ bers were not treated 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the existence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ Q and 14@@ 7@@ A / L / M / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F /
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always move the actual interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
on prototyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses medical validation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ e data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ mal@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ ective @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r associated gene@@ tical patterns creates a certain Crus@@ ade against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between am@@ ass@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ections for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ active patients , with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r@@ - hal@@ ted schema ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the other way round , Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r keeps his activity against some other prot@@ ect@@ are @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early breaking treatment of an reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in bo@@ unds , which can affect the subsequent treatment detri@@ mental .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( I@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , primarily associated with degra@@ d@@ do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
disposable tri@@ angular ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least a different PI and at least one NR@@ TI have been included in the participation study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ fast@@ ened average change of the amount value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ killing threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ born e@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , as@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included patients a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ l on this data should be considered during the treatment of therapy with PI @-@ treated children who are expected to be considered unlikely benefit from &quot; un@@ born &quot; e@@ gener@@ acy . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0,5 up to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand lo@@ wered by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be put on a large distribution volume as well as an immense penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ restricted am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ de@@ ca@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active components during the d@@ osing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hi@@ ve or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ thi@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ lic@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ meter basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the impact of kidney @-@ functioning on the elimination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to amp@@ om@@ avi@@ r plastic mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable to those who are scored in healthy proportions after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gen@@ isation with am@@ aged avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular hep@@ omas with dos@@ ages on the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily G@@ abe of 1200 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , dis@@ missed .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ cell@@ ul@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet raised and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies as well as the therapeutic application , however , had little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ oto@@ x@@ iz@@ tests , the bacterial material mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ it test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test on r@@ amp@@ y l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ .
these liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AS@@ T , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ asis .
so far in clinical studies there has been no significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of ag@@ asy nor by the end of the treatment .
studies on toxicity that were treated with juven@@ iles at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in the control panel as well as for the animals treated with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in people , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton may be observed that refer to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ph@@ adding ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ aged avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of 2400 mg , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is intended to be treated in patients with wit@@ ters or more easily liver li@@ tigation with caution , in patients with severe liver li@@ tigation it is contra@@ sted ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ulators Ratio ) , methods for determining the active concentration of nutrients are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be ab@@ used in duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk to a li@@ pod@@ cular ph@@ ie has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ ctive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max , by contrast to 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ aged avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of r@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) have been reached ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a nar@@ row@@ ly monitoring , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ is@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ rac@@ ers would be low .
if these medicines will be applied together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be done as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , to get a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ o@@ pin , pine @-@ pin , pine @-@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ bb@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ gangs , climbed up the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ plastic tiles significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by about 86 % ( 90 % consistency interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
in the current case of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a mi@@ tigation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ po@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this medicine may be applied only after careful absorption of potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks associated with the fo@@ etus .
a reproductive study of more bear@@ able rats , which was administered from the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the l@@ ac@@ tation of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r , showed during the down@@ time a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight .
the invali@@ dity of a@@ or@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
the other way round , Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r keeps his activity against some other prot@@ ect@@ are @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data should be considered during the treatment of therapy with PI @-@ treated children who are expected to be considered unlikely use of &quot; un@@ born &quot; e@@ gener@@ acy .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ de@@ ca@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active components during the d@@ osing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hi@@ ve or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore the impact of kidney @-@ functioning on the elimination of Am@@ ra@@ viol@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gen@@ isation with am@@ aged avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular hep@@ omas with dos@@ ages on the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to the man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ cel@@ o@@ genic Aden@@ o@@ ids and car@@ cin@@ oma has not been un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , had little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on toxicity that were treated with juven@@ iles at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in the control panel as well as for the animals treated with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
these results make sure that in juven@@ ile the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ esthe@@ tic solution for inser@@ tion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ ective @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase solution to use was not held either with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than from Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with the intake of the solution to setup ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ esthe@@ tic solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ fil@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ esthe@@ tic solution for storing and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination of these patients .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ is@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ rus , is an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to use in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic response as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ ance is a@@ gener@@ ase solution to use in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver fail and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can cause a sti@@ peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ing of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . )
patients should be pointed out that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk 47 to transfer HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ulators Ratio ) , methods for determining the active concentration of nutrients are available .

the application &apos;s application and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating illness . • At case of case studies in the genital area , the cream can be applied six weeks 5 times a week . • At least four weeks of treatment cycles , it is used during one or two four @-@ month cycles , with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is thin before bed@@ time thin on the affected skin surfaces so that they will remain sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area respectively 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete separation of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small ba@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo either weekly or five times a week .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara has also been tested in two studies at a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute cor@@ at@@ ants .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • When the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was the complete absorption rate of 66 % up to 52 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % up to 3 % in the placebo group .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ase I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms associated with brain or nerves in connection ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ c@@ ic@@ ans , g@@ ags ) will not be dis@@ assembled and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and do this .
the following not neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult to complain , dimin@@ ishing pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , cardi@@ ac and o@@ gener@@ alization .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary diseases .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with res@@ ur@@ ing devices , and patients require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was examined , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by analy@@ sing its effect with regard to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of sen@@ um@@ y@@ me Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine at about 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed out a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , stomach ache , skin rash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ ia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point .
very common side @-@ effects amongst patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ der ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be severe ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ asis or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not being applied .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be all the new information that may be announced , check and update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patient , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 the European Commission informed the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ Cell cultur@@ en ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ots I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) indi@@ cted to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no d@@ osing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver suff@@ lation has not been determined and for these patients no d@@ osing schedule can be recommended .
with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as each in connection by side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also continue to be supervised and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ plac@@ eable equipment for medical emergen@@ cies will be immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study we expect that almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months starting treatment of treatment .
patients , antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
given little experience in the res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical risk of a surplus @-@ level reaction after a break of treatment must be cau@@ tious .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( Anti @-@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ Py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential appearance in@@ fusion reaction .
in case of a light or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ought to be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion of inflation in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction must be stopped using in@@ fusion until the symptoms are associated , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( Anti @-@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate that occurred in the preceding reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ asis is formed .
animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that close the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been expon@@ entially above the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to be silent .
the effects in clinical studies have been constituted mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted pharmaceuticals in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that have been observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are given in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ tion@@ ter involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ story appeared also heavy reactions , including bronze @-@ gro@@ c@@ eries , breathing stal@@ acti@@ le and facial expressions ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children of im@@ pregn@@ able medication related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with mainly heavy loads and treatment duration up to 12 months , have been listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ otonin version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients aged under 5 years with a severe aber@@ ration was carried out during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ ulsion from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients were not in@@ consistent with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ av@@ ag@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say im@@ plant@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients where there was never too ser@@ otonin release .
patients with l@@ acked down to low anti@@ body levels have been a robust reduction in the G@@ AG sp@@ y in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ments a variable decrease of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in the phase @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low neutral inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the resin .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be not associated with the incidence of und@@ es@@ irable medication transactions , even though the occurrence of und@@ es@@ irable medication transactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ asis is rapidly removed from the cycle and captured by cells into the l@@ os@@ omes , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , who were recru@@ ited the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the Middle phen@@ otyp@@ e and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value we had , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute pav@@ ement in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label survey study , where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the ability to perform in the table below .
in the open case study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage percentage FE@@ V is not significant over that period and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased greatly proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ alie prior to treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was fixed , which remained constant until the end @-@ end .
with regard to the hetero@@ genic disease of disease between the patients , which takes into account by using a combined final FE@@ V , circuit in 6 @-@ minute walking , movement of the shoulder blade of AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement among 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmaceuticals of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined by 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy dro@@ ple@@ t form and 4 with mid @-@ term form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) followed by the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the average dro@@ ple@@ t form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the medium sk@@ ating form had limited limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations into phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ dynamic impacts of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me d@@ osing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage flow@@ chart with 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ological profile among patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who were previously not treated previously in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemical therapies to be used as sole therapy .
to decrease side effects , patients should take during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid organ ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed down , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins in his active shape goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the medication and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ eli@@ sts , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease before .
in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 month , compared with 9.5 months in the all@@ appointments of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.4 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer does not attack the plate cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission informed the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. is a approval for the market from A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every circulation @-@ bottle must be measured with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from a car@@ ving bag and 0,@@ 9 % so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injection ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml is dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is available in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic CR@@ C ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in mon@@ otherapy for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic CR@@ C ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body ( COM ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ G@@ abe and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses fol@@ ate and intake must be continued during the whole therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) within the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third floor cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , each gift should be created a full of blood @-@ screen , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ance .
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AS@@ T or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage adjustment must take place under Ber@@ brid@@ ging the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are treated for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 eding .
should patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ ( excluding neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when in patients after 2 dosage reduction , hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ - or above to patients aged 65 years an increased out@@ efficiency risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data on imm@@ ort@@ ality and effectiveness .
in clinical trials were carried out in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary over which recommended for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a credit in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients were examined using a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ number of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ pled from the upper border value ( at Ab@@ - Wes@@ tern@@ ity of Leb@@ er@@ metastatic hav@@ ens ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ Number of the upper border value ( in presence of hep@@ atitis ) is not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to Kno@@ x chen@@ ia and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered in patients before their absolute neut@@ ron numbers has reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ died of a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for more cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ ron and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as shown in the preceding treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ological toxicity such as Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ le Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ ated when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients must be dependent on patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous occurrence of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients requiring a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken , intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time treatment for at least 5 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events played , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid fertili@@ zation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of result in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment will be weigh@@ ed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ ts , and cereb@@ ro@@ se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zing events have been reported in clinical trials at P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated hard@@ ships ( except yel@@ low@@ fever , this vaccination is contra@@ sted ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a irrever@@ sible impair@@ ment of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment , consultation with regard to the sperm @-@ conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ oxid@@ ation ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased appearance of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ a- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ c acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - aci@@ dity in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed can be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data in terms of interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , during the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the skin status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ dependen@@ cies between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplastics chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .

the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat meal of fat or low @-@ fat food .
since the weight reduction in diabetes comes with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic medication needs to be adjusted .
patients , the alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol levels should take their physician or pharmac@@ ist asking whether the dosage must be adjusted to these medicines .
it is recommended to meet additional swe@@ eping measures to prevent the possible contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible predi@@ ctions ( see Section 4.5 ) .

in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta car@@ ot@@ ins were in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a complement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient power consumption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a sing@@ ular li@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed at a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received , a minor withdrawal of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are connected with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects have been determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the prevalence are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at has not been known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of irregular size .
curing It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli gains in terms of potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
individual p@@ ants of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ tro@@ users of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight proportions , without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar effects as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at are reported .
based on humans and animals can be derived from a rapid activation of systemic systemic effects that are derived from or@@ p@@ ate properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and Pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies has been derived , that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ts was blocked .
two double @-@ fl@@ ashes , random@@ ized , plac@@ ental controlled trials at adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 representing the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , low @-@ du@@ ed diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight towards the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those students that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction have been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall appearance amoun@@ ted with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( amount worth 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( value value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo @-@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , the therapeutic dos@@ ages not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without indication of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which was administered with a minimum system@@ ically res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased dose , could have been identified two main met@@ abo@@ ite , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ ed lacqu@@ ers ) and M3 ( M1 according to the separation of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine ) , identified as almost 42 % of the total plas@@ modi@@ al concentration .

alo@@ xi is used in Chem@@ o@@ therapies , who are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as Chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
this means that the active ingredient protects the bond of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tus amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemical therapies received , which are strong or regular trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in Chem@@ o@@ therapies , who are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ u@@ ron for patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in Chem@@ o@@ therapies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ ia treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission informed the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ cted : to prevent ak@@ est nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with du@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induc@@ es by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one prior to chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can prolong the col@@ on @-@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ cut@@ ters I@@ le@@ us after injection @-@ machine .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ D interval can be extended or which tend to be an extension .
except in connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics re@@ hub , alo@@ xi is to be used either in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhibit@@ ing the activity of the five studied chemical therapeu@@ tics not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ c@@ C ) .
in a clinical trial does not show any significant pharmac@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady state concentration , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ine@@ tic analysis has been shown that the simultaneous G@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ induc@@ tors ( Ami@@ ah@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol , Val@@ ox@@ al@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ zi@@ af@@ in ) has no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied at pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the responsible physician .
in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least may possibly with alo@@ xi in connection were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity transactions and reactions to appointments ( burning , curing , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of und@@ es@@ irable events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted due to the large distribution volume , however , there is probably no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ de over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ fl@@ ashes , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time for 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without de@@ x@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients , which were a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients that have been 32 mg on@@ de@@ set@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the appropriate effects of On@@ dan@@ An@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the constitu@@ tive investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average @-@ time semi @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma @-@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations of concentration time ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between Day 1 and Day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simulation calculations , the total @-@ day intraven@@ ous gift comes from 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total value ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured values ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the recur@@ ring of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated over the kidneys , and about another 50 % are transformed into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ism showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous Sing@@ ing dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredients made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous pattern in healthy was the overall physical size 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver li@@ tigation the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary half @-@ time and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , however , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects have been observed only after positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials have evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the promotion of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose un@@ answered in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ atic mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results are very low for men .
the owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission about plans for the marketing of transport within the framework of this decision @-@ approved medicine .

al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hep@@ atitis C ( one caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scope investigation the liver tissue has been applied , the values of the liver enzy@@ me Alan@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood decreases .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data which occupy the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , operation , safety and effectiveness in hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference response to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study was measured just how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatments as well as 6 months after setting the treatment on the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is the E@@ MEA , &quot; What have been the biggest concerns which prompted CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail to approve the carriage .
in addition , concerns have been expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the substance and of the drug @-@ market drugs have not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to the clinical study similar .
after adjustment of the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon flow@@ ed the disease with more patients back than at the reference phar@@ ma ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had any side effects .
apart from that , the test included in the study was investig@@ ating the question to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be applied for the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ushing skin infection ) and small infected in@@ soles ( r@@ iss@@ ors or mou@@ se@@ ds ) , me@@ ager and paraly@@ sis wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which are documented or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against these kinds of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the surface of the body .
if the patient refers to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial infection ( the parts of the bacterial infection , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was carried out after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo languages on treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ ts , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ ex@@ in were reported in similar response : when the results of both studies have been taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ os , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were taken into treatment .
in these two studies however , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of su@@ cking ( eit@@ ed hol@@ low @-@ habitats in the body tissue ) or by infections , which were reported or probably due to MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity at the agent .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during the cur@@ ator treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections in contrast to the risks predomin@@ ate : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ duced small in@@ fir@@ ing , sc@@ atter@@ ing or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission appointed the G@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the market entry by Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
the patients , in which within two or three days doesn &apos;t show a recovery , you should once again be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of raising or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be the treatment is sealed , the sage is carefully di@@ vest@@ ment and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will start .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used for treating infection where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary open wounds , the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or a deterioration of the infected body .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been reached by humans according to topical application on be@@ aked skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gifts of 2 @-@ time 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on be@@ de@@ fle@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not required when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a Re@@ production @-@ toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the impact on the birth and the fold / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy only when a top@@ ic anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , between the use of the breast@@ feeding point for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation on appointment , which considered about 1 % of the patients .
activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vatives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective im@@ itation of bacterial proteins by interaction with a specific link position of the bacterial reef , which differs from connecting other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the ties of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ a@@ ez@@ h .
by connection to this connecting point of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , blocking partial P @-@ links interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should be investigated on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infectious forms , should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ ently Valent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on shi@@ el@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary treatment of secondary wounds , individual plastic pipes have been won .
the sampling takes place at the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system intake on humans according to topical application of 1 % Sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 be@@ amed skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Shirt .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ istic liver micro@@ som@@ en was praised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

the holder of permission for the market will need to make sure that a pharmaceutical codi@@ le system , as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is presented ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is available and it works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is applied .
the owner of the approval for the market is obligated to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance activities as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP .
as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; guideline of Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report .
getting irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place , you should finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor .
do not turn out other sal@@ ts , creams or lo@@ tions on the surface that will be treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not explicit from your doctor .
it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area .
if the sal@@ tw@@ ater looks out on one of these areas , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor about advice , if complaints occur .
after mounting the sal@@ be , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ il@@ en association or an Gaz@@ ever@@ band unless your doctor has got you , the area will not cover you .
it is offered in a aluminium tube with a plastic clas@@ p which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of sal@@ be , or in a aluminum bag , which contains 0.5 g o@@ be .
Ambi@@ rix is applied to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between a and 15 years that are not yet immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can lead to an end from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hep@@ atitis @-@ A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
vaccines have function by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can rise up against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system re@@ alizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix includes the same ingredients as the vaccine administered by Twin@@ rix grown since 1996 and has since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix kids .
the three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases , but are administered by Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children within three doses existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a test@@ ament to the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection of the anti@@ body anti@@ body .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ lack gel , pain in the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ th@@ fulness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients , who may be overweight ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ c@@ ine ( an antibiotic ) , not being applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission appointed the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to provide a permit for the marketing of ambition throughout the country .
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ing plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administered by six to twelve months after the first dosage .
if a re@@ fres@@ hen campaigns is required for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combination of combin@@ ant .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis which observed after a pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with the composite anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body values are within the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not fully backed up , whether or competent persons who have addressed on a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vaccination , a re@@ fres@@ hen campaigns as protection , since they are also protected with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies , and may be protected by immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ecting materials should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring are always immediately available .
if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the com@@ bin@@ ation@@ ally recommended , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface .
with ha@@ modi@@ fying agents and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ body can be achieved , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration in the gest@@ ures can lead to a subtle imp@@ apping success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood @-@ inn@@ ish disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected without sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular G@@ abe to ble@@ eding .
if ambitions in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ tic@@ ular and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ on vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens adequate ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that no adequate immun@@ o@@ answer is achieved .
in a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 vaccines this wording was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ eri@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency which was observed during the earlier Thi@@ ck@@ ery and preser@@ vatives @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ ated vaccine .
clinical trials were administered by 20@@ 29 vaccines at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 - including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix had compared with the 3 @-@ cans compres@@ sor .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ th@@ fulness on a calculation basis per vaccine ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test observed , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the test according to the gift of a dosage of 3 doses of 3 doses .
after the complete vaccination @-@ cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the test , the ambition had been given , about pain , opposite to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % at the test , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage combination .
the frequency of die was however comparable ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test , the ambition were received , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % with the test tubes , which received the 3 doses compromise ) .
the frequency weigh@@ ted pain and matrix was low and comparable to that after administration of the combination of combin@@ ant with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed .
in a comparative study on 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the appearance of local transactions and general transactions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group comparable to that which was observed with administration with the 3 cans com@@ bin@@ ations with 360 ELISA units de@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of com@@ bin@@ ed hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface .
at the 6@@ - till 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambitions , a common appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not reported per pro@@ band .
the share of vaccines that schem@@ atic over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units de@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B@@ X @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of com@@ bin@@ ed hep@@ atitis C , was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials , which were carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions were carried out for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambitions and 147 the standard combin@@ ation@@ ists with three doses .
for the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ ology was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective mar@@ ry ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dosage is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ology , which were achieved in a clinical study case at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations either received a 2 @-@ cans vaccination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccination scheme with 360 ELISA units de@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface .
for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambitions in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
the immun@@ o@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , after vaccination from 3 doses with a combination of com@@ bin@@ ations , consisting of 360 ELISA units de@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in by dra@@ gged waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ aming face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( Yellow searches ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child will already be infected with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus . ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ argu@@ ably or ill ) , a vaccination may not prevent a vaccine .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those after a Hepatitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already proven an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ c@@ ine ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed through ju@@ icy skin attacks , breathing or an@@ esthe@@ tics of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B at your child . • If you have performed a serious infection with fever or hep@@ atitis B .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the deadline for the second vaccination allow@@ ance ) .
with a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambitions .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface ) .
the second vacc@@ in@@ osis of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered for one month after the first dose and may provide you with your child a vaccination protection prior to termination of the vacc@@ inations .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is suffering from individuals who suffer from heavy blood cl@@ ashes , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / her child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body resistance , or if you / your child are under@@ lining a tick @-@ analysis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strong the response to the vaccine is .
21 If you take your doctor if you can take another medicine / take ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / have been vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be , however , that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate bodies and as different li@@ mbs .
if ambition should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
in addition , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not administered unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated with both hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ c@@ ine ( antibiotic ) for your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the division of the first approval for the market place , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambitions have been positive .
since Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ k can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y ( brain damage as a result of high seeds ) in the pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ l is divided - divided into several single p@@ ants to meals - swal@@ lows up among the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ ach@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading tube ) or an nas@@ al ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ dy could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ the@@ tical medication , i.e. without a substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ets can also lead to appetite in blood , depression , stim@@ ul@@ ability , head@@ ache , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , rash , rash , inc@@ iner@@ ation , rash , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps on patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle effectively prevents stress levels of am@@ moni@@ ous weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ dy was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as due to the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of approval was limited to this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients , in which a complete z@@ ym@@ chan@@ gel has already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ le form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ eri@@ ct that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first age of life ) , there is a indication for use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ ac defect @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered in patients with difficulty disorders , as a risk for the formation of o@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS therefore should be used in patients with soci@@ alised cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium @-@ formation @-@ related clinical conditions only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure , only with extreme care .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indications ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a tigh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed maturity of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined if Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated during the person &apos;s breast milk , and for this reason is the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the down@@ time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least an und@@ es@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ek@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic encephalopath@@ y in conjunction with l@@ ac@@ aci@@ as , heavy mort@@ al@@ kal@@ ine , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose stood at a 5 @-@ month old small @-@ child with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed with intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lical active connection that is con@@ ju@@ red by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that will take part in the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is seen Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram mon@@ et so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate nitrogen are produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment will start immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms associated with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga inside the first quarter of the year to death .
by her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative path@@ ic acids ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ ate , so@@ dium and so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl , it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new bor@@ rowed by post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephalopath@@ y , the survival rates was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ le form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ inal shape of the or@@ ni@@ vor@@ ian bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y and afterwards permanently treated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ ri@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the case of treatment and some patients may arise further deterioration of neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ red in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ sch with glut@@ amine , whereas Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and his met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were found after gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after items as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous G@@ abe ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single @-@ dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ measurable Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary @-@ cycle disorders or Hä@@ mo@@ ka bin@@ opath@@ ies was reported after different doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after warm fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single p@@ ants ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ cent@@ ric brick on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ icy product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us @-@ tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans treated rats ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can still not swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a also or a nas@@ al cure .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ ac defect @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain lesi@@ on .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ek@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic encephalopath@@ y in conjunction with l@@ ac@@ aci@@ as , heavy mort@@ al@@ kal@@ ine , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is seen Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative replacement for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value
on the basis of investigations on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine in patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram mon@@ et so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate nitrogen are produced .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the case of treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur .
after an oral single @-@ dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were established 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ measurable Plas@@ ma@@ inst@@ alls of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .

if a patient has to obtain the medication about a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the toxic waste products that cannot be eliminated after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , because Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken if it is not prescription drug .
during the down@@ time you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the drug could move into the breast milk and harm your baby .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ my@@ ard ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( anom@@ aly measurement value in electric cardi@@ o@@ gram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent cl@@ ots in patients infected with one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
roughly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the sole propriet@@ or in combination with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ an II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ot@@ ting treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies ) used in the arter@@ ies , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ ask@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who subjected themselves to one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for heavy ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than yeast .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other stags or any of the other components .
it may not be applied in patients who recently had a hem@@ ung , as well as people with heavy hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) led to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a removable replacement for pi@@ et@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission appointed The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the market entry by An@@ det@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ inf@@ all ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency access or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of an@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ tion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in the patient , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h increases .
after the PCI request , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bul@@ letin of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous fixing of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis should be measured rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dosage is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be employed a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second ph@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) that led to the approval was , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indications ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous nucle@@ ation of low @-@ molecular pi@@ et@@ in .
• better @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active ble@@ eding or elevated blood @-@ risk cancer . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial infection . • heavy kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment in terms of symptoms and signs of a hem@@ ung , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ el@@ is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if both PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding occur in arter@@ ial point positions , can occur in patients who undergo a per@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ator ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ulators Ratio ) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal reg@@ ained that of the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ders ) can be assumed that these drugs increase the blood of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding compounds or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ emo@@ tionally @-@ parameters are the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ as@@ e@@ parameters in any case regularly .
the animal @-@ experimental investigations are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , insufficient or the post@@ nat@@ al development inadequate ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with pi@@ et@@ in @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it came more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy ble@@ eding have been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y and TI@@ MI scales for heavy ble@@ eding such as in the foot@@ row of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred in their own significantly less frequently than in the groups with s@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ fusion , intra@@ oc@@ ular hem@@ or@@ der@@ mis ble@@ eding or blood pressure required , ha@@ em@@ om with diameter ≥ 5 g / d@@ l with known blood lines , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
more , less common observ@@ ations that appeared at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ man , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who subjected to one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal group , as well as in patients with pi@@ et@@ in @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it came more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding emerged under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the comparative @-@ group of He@@ at plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above were reported after a comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system classes in table 6 .

the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , juven@@ iles and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process enough ins@@ ulin for the regulation of the glu@@ cose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not able to work effectively .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is a little bit s@@ cri@@ mp@@ tuous of Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it acts quicker and has a shorter period of activity than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in the application in combination with an effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes was determined for six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood@@ glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission appointed San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ ows Deutschland GmbH with a permit for the marketing of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdom@@ en , ceiling or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ en .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ eo@@ genesis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin @-@ change , the ins@@ ulin needs may be down in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of the active thickness , the brand ( s ) , the ins@@ ulin @-@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delays etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in ins@@ ulin .
3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ular diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ as ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of ins@@ ulin or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict physician supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the time of appearance of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change from the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that can increase the blood sugar activity and ampli@@ fy the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic activity , or@@ ale anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fever , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ oxi@@ di@@ ine , obesity and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika like sc@@ rub@@ bing , cl@@ oning , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ swe@@ ar counter @-@ regulation be f@@ ished or absent .
animal experimental studies on Re@@ production @-@ toxicity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ ck@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin is absorbed into the human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ hap@@ ing after oral application .
following are the derived from clinical trials known of und@@ es@@ irable pharmaceuticals and sorted according to decreasing number of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the availability of availability ) .

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy vor@@ d fails to switch the inj@@ ections within the injection range , can result in a sequence a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy to occur at the inj@@ ections .
serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a appropriately trained person , or treated by intraven@@ ous gift by a physician .
after glu@@ cose ra@@ inf@@ all the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the periph@@ eral glu@@ cose ra@@ inf@@ all ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and through the im@@ itation of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at sub@@ cut@@ ters ga@@ - be of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active time is shorter than in hu@@ e @-@ man@@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ ia , T@@ US showed In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the therapeu@@ tically relevant metering range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg or more dis@@ proportionate increase in glu@@ cose impact , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as fast as norm@@ alized Human@@ ins@@ ulin and the complete mi@@ tigation effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was apparent that at an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ ised norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
became In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a better post @-@ ran@@ di@@ al control than with human norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
is ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human @-@ norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - routes before meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - before ) prior to the meal in comparison to human norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 30 minutes ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human norm@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) prior to a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
