<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public awareness report (EPAR) in which the studies conducted as the Committee for Humanotherapy (CHMP) conducted in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please refer to the PPAR package (also part of EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melttable (tablets that can solve in the mouth), as a solution for saving (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), distrust and insulating; • Biobi-disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients some manic episodes (periods of normal high-tuning) have alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify becomes the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection-solution is used for quick control of tighter anxiety or behavioral disorders, when the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases the solution for storing or the melttable in patients can be applied to swallowing the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiastbenzene probably appears above all as a "partial agonists" for the receptors of neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptus amine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiastbenzene like 5-hydroxytryptus and dopamine, but in a lesser extent appears as the neurotransmitters in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptus deficiency play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripianist carries out to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and to prevent their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify that prevent reformation of symptoms, has been studied in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to the untreated anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study Abilify about twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent re-occur in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was carried out in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered an undisturbed break with that of Lorazepam (an other antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients asking for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies by investigating how the body absorbs the melttable and the solution to decrease resorted.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution shown patients, the Abilify patients in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received, a significant increase in symptoms of undisturbed anxiety as the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re-act manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of irritated anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepat.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for freezing (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (instiffness), somatic, nauseeption (constiffness), saliva (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, ruin (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) led to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify for treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episode in patients who had mainly managed episodes and in which the manic episodes relate to treatment with Aripiastbenzene, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection-solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bial-I-disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to predominate from the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 gathered the European Commission to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate-heavy episodes of Bibi-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients displayed mostly of manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiastbenzene (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an average dose of 15 mg / day one day regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bians disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is canceled from the combination therapy, the Aripivotal dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suizier behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treating Aripiastbenzene (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased disinfection risk with Aripiastbenzene in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiephod should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (dehydration), cerebral disorders, conditions that predisputed for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-pressure drugs) or hypertension (including akcelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spatidyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiastbenzene (dynasty).</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY-treated patients signs and symptoms of a spatidylitter should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms which pointed out on a mns, or improper high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics, including ABILIFY, have to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiastbenzene in patients with crampant cases should be in the anamnese or in states that are related to crampant cases with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) associated with Aripike in patients with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, had patients who were treated with Aripiastbenzene, an increased mortality compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however in one of these studies, a study involving Fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cerebral events with Aripiastbenzene treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziebox or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment of hyperglycaemia-related events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medication-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally associated with schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbientities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiastbenzene on the central nervous system, caution is recommended if Aripiastbenzene in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines is taken with overbearing side effects such as Sedierung (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorpation rate of Aripiastbenzene, though this effect is not relevant to be clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy testing, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiastbenzene in order to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolizing, the common application can result with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma-benzene (compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism).</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift from Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-protein inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosage should be raised from ABILIFY to the dosage height prior to the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escgenital opram) or CYP2D6 will be administered together with ABILIFY, with a moderate increase in Aripivotels concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripipelbenzene per day does not show any significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-method morphinan-ratio), 2C19 (Omesbenzene) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get out to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiastbenzene.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety during human beings and due to the concerns in the reproduction studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies, clearly the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiswan has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="71">To the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about whose appearance also reported in treating Aripipelines, Spatidyskinfusion and varicult, unwanted events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentional overdosiations with Aripiastbenzene alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the efficacy of a tick-fashions in treating an overdose with Aripiastbenzene; however, it is unlikely, however, that hermodise is beneficial to the treatment of an overdose of benefits, since Aripiastbenzene has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripipelvic with schizophrenia and bial-I-disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiephod showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and for serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrengen and for Histamine-H1receptors.</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage of 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bienne-I-disorder showed Aripiastbenzene (compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with Fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bienne-I-disorder showed Aripiastbenzene compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bial-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, showed Aripianist showed a compared to placebo over effect in week 3 and a cleaning effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi-opidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiastbenzene also in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie on such as lithium or semi-opidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bial-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks does not depend on Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy in therapeutical symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission during a stabilisation phase prior to placebo over a stabilisation phase prior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, predominantly in preventing a return to the mania.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-crotubules which promotes the assembling of the microtubules from the tubailers and stabilize the micro-ubuli by imitation of their landolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulary network, which is essential for the vitale interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumlitaxel promotes the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendoelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albuminrereceptor and due to the incuminous protagonist SPARC (secreted protein acidic Rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>

<seg id="749">The summary of the EPAR for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Appeal Report (EPAR) in which the studies conducted as the Committee for Humanotherapy (CHMP) conducted in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monootherapy) in patients (especially overoverweight patients) where metformin (a diabolic drug) cannot be displayed. • It can be applied together with another diabolic disease (dual treatment).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overoverweight patients) which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest compatibility dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl estant or insulin can be maintained in the beginning of Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonyl estant or insulin is to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's physical insulin is better to be used and the blood sugar level reduces that type-2 diabetes is better adjustable.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either from Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration was measured in the blood (glycosylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which makes it possible that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study the effect of the additional gift from Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl-values showed up to 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, where the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients was examined, patients, the Actos in addition to insulin took up, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients requiring additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper airways (colds), weight gain and mortgage (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may be overpriced (allergic) towards Pioglitazon or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoaziebox (high ketone mirror - saw in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin patients is to serve in which metformin does not appear.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission distributed to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited by Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and wear on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the transcription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown in combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin due to contraindications or intolerances is inappropriate (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced karmic reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and ecdeme when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrorovas illness was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased input cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x limit of standard-range) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to the 3-number of the limit of the standard-range are increased, the liver chanyms are used to control again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops, point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, thightening, tightness and / or darker harn, are the liver liymouth to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be diverted up to the preliminary parameters of clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazon, a dosisdependent weight gain has been proven of fat deposits, and in some cases associated with a hydration.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a tick-screen, under the therapy with pioglitazon a slightly reduced reduction in the medium-level volumes (relative reduction of 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.3%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in a comparative study involving pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin to 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulfonyl resin and insulin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin around 1-2% and of the hematocular to 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity to patients, the pioglitazon as oral or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of doso-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with ThiazolidIndions, including Pioglitazon, reported on a occurrence or worsening of a diabetic maculary with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct relation between ingestion of pioglitazon and the appearance of Makulaödems, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a maculary if patient notices on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of announcements of unwanted events related to bone, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture was 1.1 freight fortifications per 100 patient-years in patients with pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a similar medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events, compared with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a similar medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is canceled (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are lized from these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA-reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor), in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in lowering the AUC of Pioglitazon around 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to that treatment with pioglitazon which diminished in the pregnancy hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother's body and thus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (made available data are not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turmoors and of refractive indexes of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazon played ALT anstiege over the triple of the limit of the standard-range, often on how to placebo, more rare than in comparisons under Metformin or sulfonyl hardwood.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macroeconomic disease infection was the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon around 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely reported on heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summary analysis of announcements of unwanted events related to bone, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated in patients with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in patients with comparative-related groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.6%) of patients with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a similar medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitiveness of liver, obesity and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon increases the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral of glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to study the time until the descendants of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.2% after the first 6 treatment month).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy started a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients treated under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeboat survey over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three-month optimization phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the mean HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patients who remain only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies about one year under Pioglitazon catches a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Creatinin-Quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, based on 18 weeks of investigations on type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the overall serum triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazon was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while metformin and gliclazide reduced values have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober-glyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial higher triglyceride levels, this both for an effect on the glyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a kardiovascular age study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrorovas illness were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, with the peak concentration on unaltered pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours to use.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Ininhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive markified Pioglitazon in the human being the marker was mainly found in the barrel (55%) and a lesser extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination of unaltered pioglitazon amounts to the people 5-6 hours, and that of the entire active Metabolites lies 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-concentration of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy proportions, but resemble the rates of the orical clearing of the mother substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys constituent after repeated appointments, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon which diminished in the creation of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the matrieres and thus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for low-killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were inducted by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events, compared with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a similar medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies conducted over 1 year under Pioglitazon catches a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober-glyceride levels, but improved the postprandial higher triglyceride levels, this effect on the effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endsetpoint, stroke, acutant coronary coronary syndrome, pamputation above the ankle, coronary Revaskarisation and Revaskarisation of the leg-arteries, put the results close that with the intake of pioglitazon no kardiovasculic-term risks are associated with.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrapane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type-1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type-2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration was measured (glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrapane led to a decrease in the HbA1c spider, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrapane should not be applied to patients who may be overweight (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrapane might need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect the blood sugar (the full list is the package fee).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) led to the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes also predominate over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission appointed the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the transport of Actrapane in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved for example by an intense insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycaemia-warnings and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Every change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, Humaninsulin or Insulinanalogon) and / or manufacture method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin origin) can result in a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If switching to Actrafane is required when a dosage adjustment is required, it can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of aerosaze is taken twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (pettiped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be succulled to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main exercises were the changes in the severity of the hypotheupfaymph atoms, which were reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all grasps of the nose, the patients, the aerosaze increases the patients, the aerosaze revenues, compared to 35.9% compared to the patients, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose mucosa was viewed, the patients showed under the aeropaze a lens of symptoms around 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients, the desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykarim (heart chase), oral drush, psychomotor hyperactivity (appetite), constipation, fatigue, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>

<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to break down or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerosaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the failure of data for unobjectionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after passing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of time to 10 days, as in long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the veils in the upper airways the treatment may be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contrasted in patients who are treated with monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor, respectively within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimtic activity in combinated application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, lacomatic, Cabergyanine, phenylephrine, Epylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, Napoolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient collective, and the data does not suffice to speak appropriate recommendations to dosing.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years involving human immune immune virus by type 1 (HIV-1) which is causing the acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, Agenerase is at disposal as a solution to boarding, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be ordered if the doctor has checked, which antiviral medicines has previously been taken in the patient, and the likelihood has judged that the virus is addressed to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aging is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aesase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adult men who were previously not treated with Protected Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosied Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, which had been taken earlier as a release, with other protections.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with unsubstantiated concentrations of HIV in the blood (virus last) or the change in the virus last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no prototype, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than among placebo, but egenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children of reduced pervase also the Virtlast, however, of the children that were treated earlier with Protected Chambers, were only very few of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Protected Chambers, which were treated with Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase the Viruslast after 16-week treatment as effectively as other protections:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protections, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks than with the patients who are continuing to increase their previous prototype:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of agasy (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amaged avir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be applied to patients, the currants are used (herbal supplement to treat depression) or medicines which are just as disrupting and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines to HIV, the ageneracy is taking the risk of a Lipodcular phy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecrose (Abdie of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection which caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) led to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1 infected adult and children over four years face the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacoinetic amplifiers, but the committee fixed that the use of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have a prototype, not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>

<seg id="1926">Agenerative is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Protective-treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be administered from Amfilavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amplavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amfilavir as a solution to take is 14% lower than from Amfilavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amfilavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Boophadding), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amaged avir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of 2400 mg, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceuticals, effectiveness and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protections were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the loss of data to inadequacy and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is supposed to be done in patients with slight or even liver litigation with caution, in patients with severe liver litigation it is contrasted (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicinal products that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk reduction of plasma voltages and a diminished therapeutic effect of amplavir during ingradecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that aging or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current anti-retroviral therapy including treatment with agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral compromise therapy, have an increased risk for heavy duty effects associated with potentially deadly conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the specialized information of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing restricted liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver lidysfunctions under an antiretroviral compromise therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other glucose metabolism is not recommended, unless the possible benefits of treatment weighs the risk systemically corrosive effects including Morbus Csore and Suppression of the secondary function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reduction Lovastatin and simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, an equalization of agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopathy including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Regulators Ratio), methods for determining the active concentration of nutrients are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs simultaneously, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plastic tiles of Amfilavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amplavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with amplavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if also low doses can be administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity, due to the high output of toxicity, due to the high propylenglycolding of the agenerase solution to take, this intestinal form is contrasted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be abused in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucosous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protracers, was reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exception by an existing Diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In hammophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with protections, reports on an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous commutations and hamarthrows.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV infected patients with severe immune defective can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to serious clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including application of cortical eroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosupposes, higher body mass index), reported cases of osteonecrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an anti-retroviral compromise therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with small therapeutic width aesase can not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given along with pharmaceuticals, whose active substances are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated to the elevated plasmodities with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin is caused by a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amfilavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to cut the reduced plastic plate by a dosage increase of other protonavir inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently seen unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum) The Serum mirror of Ammiavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taken into Johanniskwort, the Amfilavirst mirror, and, if possible, the Viruslast to review and expose the currants.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with amassavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax, by contrast to 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amaged avir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amraviolr have been applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and immortality of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amfilavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of konavir twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amraviolr (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ronavir twice daily) have been reached (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Amfilavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there will be a narrowly monitoring, since the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacoinetic study carried out in combination with Didanis, however, due to the viola component of Didanis, however, is recommended that the income of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least an hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with Gfavirenz in combination with amisavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amisavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protracers would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protections and available limited data suggests that Nevirapin the serum concentration of Ammiavir may be sensed.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plastic.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines will be applied together, caution is recommended; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amfilavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amfilavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to a rise in associated with rifabuine-associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, becoming a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose although there is no clinical data to exist.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical companies with agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasmity of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole once a day compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that can be listed below, including substrates, inhibitor, or induction of CYP3A4, can be applied together with Aesthease, possibly to conduct interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be focused on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines, if they are applied in combination with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other prototype, it is advisable that antazida cannot be taken at the same time as Aesthease, as it can come to resorptions.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulants that are known as enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amassavir may lead to a humiliation of the plastichoras.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, diopin, pine-pin, pine-pin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin, Nibbdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 through amplavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with agenerase can considerably increase and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in connection with side-effects including hypotric, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at progangs, climbed up the Fluticasonpropionate-plastic tiles significantly, whereas the endogenous Kortisol rose by about 86% (90% consistency interval of 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase is not recommended along with these Glukokortikoids, unless the possible benefits of treatment weighs the risk systemically cortical-cotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reduction inhibitors, such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose condensation is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of the plasmity with simultaneous administration of egenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Da plasma cutting levels of these HMG-CoA-reduction inhibitors to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended by amassavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to the stabilization of the mirror, since the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by conjunk (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be applied together with oral injectable midai (see Section 4.3), while the simultaneous application of Agenerase with parental Midazolkin must be treated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parentalem Midazolam with other protein inhibitors to a possible increase in the plasmity of Midazzam around the 3 to 4 fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with amassavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if also low doses can be administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per small reliability of historical comparisons, currently no recommendation is given as the amassavir- dose is to be adjusted if Amfilavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the current case of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an enhanced control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a mitigation or reinforcement of the antithropotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not pressible, therefore also alternative methods for receptionist recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for current fervase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied in pregnancy only after careful absorption of potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk bearer rats were detected Amfilavir-related substances, it is not known whether Amfilavir is overflowing with people into the mother's milk.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The invalidity of aorase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-related side-related side effects were lightweight to moderate, occurred early on and led rarely to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether in connection with the intake of egenerase or another simultaneously to tackle HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with Protected Chambers were not treated 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2028">On prototypical resistance-based analyses medical validation systems can be used in combination with genotype data for estimating the activity of ammalavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protective-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies, which expel diagnostic resistance tests, have been clinically phenomenal Cut-offs (partitions) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to interpreting results of a resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against amassavir associated genetical patterns creates a certain Crusade against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amassavir and other protections for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients with PI-treated patients had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) who administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included patients a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml at a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basil on this data should be considered during the treatment of therapy with PI-treated children who are expected to be considered unlikely benefit from "unborn" egeneracy. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Amfilavir takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0,5 up to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax on the other hand lowered by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) administered together with amplavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amraviolr with a meal leads to a 25% reduction of AUC, but has no effect on concentration of Amfilavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the scale and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be put on a large distribution volume as well as an immense penetration of amplavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unrestricted amplavir that represents the active part probably remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce CYP3A4 or inhive or a substrate of CYP3A4, be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Amfilavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amthiavir is made of the solution 14% less biolicable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a millimeter basis.</seg>

<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in people, however, a number of minor changes including Thymuselongation and minor skeleton may be observed that refer to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Boophadding), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amaged avir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of 2400 mg, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, to get a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The Serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, diopin, pine-pin, pine-pin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin, Nibbdipin and Verapamil can be increased by amplavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2078">In the current case of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an enhanced control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a mitigation or reinforcement of the antithropotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin from Amfilavir by 22% bzw.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was examined, it was also measured by its effectiveness (by analysing its effect with regard to reducing the GAG concentrations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of senumyme Aldurazyme the GAG concentrations in the urine at about 60%, and half of the treated children pointed out a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, stomach ache, skin rash, arthropathia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side-effects amongst patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of pulmonary function), tachyarder (accelerated heart rate), fever and shook.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be severe (allergic) to Laronidasis or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Drug Agency (EMEA) will be all the new information that may be announced, check and update this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will be patient, the Aldurazyme, in terms of reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003 the European Commission informed the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-Cell culturen (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is for long-term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mukopolysacchariots I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) indicted to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver sufflation has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as each in connection by side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also continue to be supervised and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, where replaceable equipment for medical emergencies will be immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study we expect that almost all patients are IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months starting treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when applying aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Given little experience in the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretical risk of a surplus-level reaction after a break of treatment must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (Anti-histaminika and / or antiPyretics) to minimize the potential appearance infusion reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and Paracamol / Ibuprofen ought to be weighed and / or a reduction in infusion rate at half of the infusion of inflation in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion reaction must be stopped using infusion until the symptoms are associated, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be recorded with a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion of infusion in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (Anti-histaminika and Paracamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate that occurred in the preceding reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidasis is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that close the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that have been exponentially above the mother's milk, is recommended, during treatment with aldurazyme not to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical studies have been constituted mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase-3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmaceuticals in connection with aldurazyme that have been observed during the phase-3 study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are given in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditionter involvement of upper airways and lungs in the pre-story appeared also heavy reactions, including bronze-groceries, breathing stalactile and facial expressions (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children of impregnable medication related to aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phas- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with mainly heavy loads and treatment duration up to 12 months, have been listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a serotonin version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patients aged under 5 years with a severe aberration was carried out during the age of 5 (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature expulsion from the study) in 13 / 45 patients were not inconsistent with radioimmunopavagitation (RIP) Assay implantable antibodies, including 3 patients where there was never too serotonin release.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacked down to low antibody levels have been a robust reduction in the GAG spy in Harn, while in patients with high anti-embodiments a variable decrease of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase-3 study and one in the phase-2 study) showed a marginal up to low neutral inhibitor activity in vitro, which seemed to impair the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in the resin.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be not associated with the incidence of undesirable medication transactions, even though the occurrence of undesirable medication transactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of the acute substrates and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidasis is rapidly removed from the cycle and captured by cells into the losomes, most likely over Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placeable phase-3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, who were recruited the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the Middle phenotype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the value we had, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute pavement in the 6-minute- walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label survey study, where they received further 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the ability to perform in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open case study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme-Group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage percentage FEV is not significant over that period and the absolute lung-volumes increased greatly proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatalie prior to treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG mirror in the Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was fixed, which remained constant until the end-end.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogenic disease of disease between the patients, which takes into account by using a combined final FEV, circuit in 6-minute walking, movement of the shoulder blade of AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement among 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmaceuticals of Aldurazyme was examined by 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy droplet form and 4 with mid-term form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) followed by the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the average droplet form (&lt; 2.5 years) and every 4 patients with the medium skating form had limited limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study investigations into pharmakodynamic impacts of different aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the GAG mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage flowchart with 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a reasonable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacological profile among patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on security spearology, toxicity in unique gift-toxicity, toxicity in repetitive gases and reproducibility, the preclinical data do not realize particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetreins in his active shape goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medication and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramelists, Alimta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease before.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-single lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which had previously been treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), and both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosage adjustment must take place under Berbridging the Nadirs of blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 which are treated for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 eding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients non-hematological toxicity ≥ (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy has to be interrupted by ALIMTA, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when in patients after 2 dosage reduction, hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity, 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah- or above to patients aged 65 years an increased outefficiency risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non-sufficient data on immortality and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were carried out in patients with a creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary over which recommended for all patients recommended dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a credit in Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients were examined using a liver function of &gt; the 1.5-number of the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or Transampled from the upper border value (at Ab- Westernity of Lebermetastatic havens) or &gt; 5,0-Number of the upper border value (in presence of hepatitis) is not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to Knox chenia and Pemetrexed must not be administered in patients before their absolute neutron numbers has regained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombodied of a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for more cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutron and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as shown in the preceding treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and nichthological toxicity such as Neutropenie, feble Neutropenie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neutropenie has been beated when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients must be dependent on patients with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a preventive measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous occurrence of non-steroid antiphlogistika (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- Tens 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients requiring a therapy with Pemetrexed must be taken, intake of NSAIDs with a long half-time treatment for at least 5 days before therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events played, corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existence hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid fertilization - accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of result in front of the pemetrexed treatment will be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myokardinfarts, and cerebrosecularizing events have been reported in clinical trials at Pemetrexed occasionally, if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application attenuated hardships (except yellowfever, this vaccination is contrasted) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of a irreversible impairment of the reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment, consultation with regard to the sperm-conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can lead high doses non-steroid anti-oxidation (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and Acetylsalicylacid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a decreased pemetrexed excretion with the result of an increased appearance of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Aca- tylsalicylc acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyl- acidity in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, in the day of therapy and mindes- Tens 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed can be avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data in terms of interaction with NSAIDs, as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application of Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, during the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the skin status during the disease and the possibility of interdependencies between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastics chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimesolites are expected in the pregnancy of severe birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful breakdown of usage for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of a irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is performed by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment, advice on the sperm count.</seg>

<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission informed the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicted: to prevent akest nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting with duemetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induces by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one prior to chemotherapy given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon-age, patients should be monitored with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subcutters Ileus after injection-machine.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 Antagonists, however, caution is advisable when using Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QD interval can be extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemical therapeutics rehub, aloxi is to be used either in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron inhibiting the activity of the five studied chemical therapeutics not (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cyclopein, Doxorubicin and MitomycC).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial does not show any significant pharmacinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady state concentration, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacinetic analysis has been shown that the simultaneous GYP2D6-inductors (Amiahorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Halopidol, Valoxaline, Sertralin and Terziafin) has no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies can not be applied, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied at pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the responsible physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (total of 633 patients), who at least may possibly with aloxi in connection were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity transactions and reactions to appointments (burning, curing, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of undesirable events such as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies conducted due to the large distribution volume, however, there is probably no effective therapy for a Aloxide overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-flashes, a total of 1,132 patients were compared with &lt; 50 mg / m2, carboplatin, carboplatin, carboplatin (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time for 3 hours), which was given on day 1 without dexethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, which were a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphate and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron, were compared to patients that have been 32 mg ondesetron, which were given to 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron in blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the appropriate effects of OndanAnron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the constitutive investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Iventricular de- and repolarization of the Ionenkanals and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Probanden was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.V. administered Palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of the Plasmakonzentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average-time semi-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma-concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrations of concentration time (AUC0-) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.3 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0,25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between Day 1 and Day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulation calculations, the total-day intravenous gift comes from 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total value (AUC0-) with the value of 0.75 mg of measured values; however, the Cmax was higher after the recurring of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated over the kidneys, and about another 50% are transformed into two primary Metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for Metabolism showed that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, the Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous Singing dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active ingredients made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous pattern in healthy was the overall physical size 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver litigation the terminale Eliminationary half-time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increased, however, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects have been observed only after positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical trials have evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenkanals that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the promotion of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose unanswered in about the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans) that were daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, hypophysis, pancreatic mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for a unique application, the relevance of these results are very low for men.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission about plans for the marketing of transport within the framework of this decision-approved medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Human Medical Care (CHMP) passed a negative report in which the proclaims of approval for the Incorporation of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IS / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same advice as an effective component which is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "Reference pharma" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (one caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscope investigation the liver tissue has been applied, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood decreases.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data which occupy the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, operation, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference response to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study was measured just how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatments as well as 6 months after setting the treatment on the medication (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the substance and of the drug-market drugs have not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar to the clinical study similar.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjustment of the treatment with alpheon flowed the disease with more patients back than at the reference pharma; moreover, Alpheon had any side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test included in the study was investigating the question to what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be applied for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crushing skin infection) and small infected insoles (rissors or mouseds), meager and paralysis wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which are documented or probably caused by methicillinresistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because algo against these kinds of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the surface of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient refers to the treatment two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial infection (the parts of the bacterial infection, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was carried out after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo languages on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hauts, Altargo and Cefalexin were reported in similar response: when the results of both studies have been taken together at Hautwos, about 90% of the patients of both groups were taken into treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies however, however, that Altargo was caused in the treatment of sucking (eited hollow-habitats in the body tissue) or by infections, which were reported or probably due to MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a maturity at the agent.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) led to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo during the curator treatment of the following superficial skin infections in contrast to the risks predominate: • Impetigo, • induced small infiring, scattering or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission appointed the Gxo Group Ltd. a permit for the market entry by Altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which within two or three days doesn't show a recovery, you should once again be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin salbe the treatment is sealed, the sage is carefully divestment and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will start.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to be used for treating infection where MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary open wounds, the effectiveness of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3-day treatment there is no improvement or a deterioration of the infected body.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been reached by humans according to topical application on beaked skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant imitation is not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gifts of 2-time 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on bedefleed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not required when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a Reproduction-toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the impact on the birth and the fold / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin salbe should be used during pregnancy only when a topic anti-bacterial therapy is clear and the application of reapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ended or the therapy with Altargo continued / ended, between the use of the breastfeeding point for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo was applied, the most frequently reported side-effect irritation on appointment, which considered about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Activity of reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective imitation of bacterial proteins by interaction with a specific link position of the bacterial reef, which differs from connecting other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the ties of ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-bonds and the Peptidyltransferaezh.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connection to this connecting point of Pleuromutiline the PeptidylTransfer, blocking partial P-links interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be investigated on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of reapamulin in at least some infectious forms, should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of reapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Pently Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin salbe daily under occlusion on intact and on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary treatment of secondary wounds, individual plastic pipes have been won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling takes place at the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system intake on humans according to topical application of 1% Salbe to 200 cm2 beamed skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Shirt.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of retapamulin in humanistic liver microsomen was praised by CYP3A4, under small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between a and 15 years that are not yet immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can lead to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis-A- or -B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have function by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can rise up against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system realizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix includes the same ingredients as the vaccine administered by Twinrix grown since 1996 and has since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix kids.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, but are administered by Twinrix adults and Twinrix children within three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a testament to the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection of the antibody antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix had similar to a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, Appetitlack gel, pain in the injecting, redness, matthfulness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be hypersensitive to patients, who may be overweight (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycine (an antibiotic), not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission appointed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to provide a permit for the marketing of ambition throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardising plan for the Grundimmation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administered by six to twelve months after the first dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refreshen campaigns is required for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalous vaccines or with a combination of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis which observed after a pridimmation with the composite anti-hepatitis (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis-A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are within the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully backed up, whether or competent persons who have addressed on a hepatitis A- vaccination, a refreshen campaigns as protection, since they are also protected with no longer detectable antibodies, and may be protected by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injecting materials should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring are always immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combinationally recommended, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hamodifying agents and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hbs anti-antibody can be achieved, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intra-muscular administration in the gestures can lead to a subtle impapping success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, at Thrombozytopenie or blood-innish disorders, Ambirix may be injected without subcutaneous, since it can occur in these cases after intra-muscular Gabe to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambitions in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular pertusis-, inactivated politicular and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined mason vaccine was the immune response to all antigens adequate (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective, it must be assumed that no adequate immunoanswer is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial, which was carried out with 3 vaccines this wording was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroerieritis, headache and fever comparable with the frequency which was observed during the earlier Thickery and preservatives-halogenated vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">Clinical trials were administered by 2029 vaccines at a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 - including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix had compared with the 3-cans compressor.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matthfulness on a calculation basis per vaccine ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the test observed, compared with 39,1% in the test according to the gift of a dosage of 3 doses of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination-cycle reported 66.4% of the test, the ambition had been given, about pain, opposite to 63.8% at the test, which were vaccinated with the 3-dosage combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of die was however comparable (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the test, the ambition were received, compared to 36.2% with the test tubes, which received the 3 doses compromise).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency weighted pain and matrix was low and comparable to that after administration of the combination of combinant with the 3-cans vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study on 1- to 11-year vaccines the appearance of local transactions and general transactions in the ambirixGroup comparable to that which was observed with administration with the 3 cans combinations with 360 ELISA units deinactivated hepatitis B-virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B-surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- till 11- year old, however, after vaccination with ambitions, a common appearance of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not reported per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that schematic over heavy side effects during the 2-doses vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-cans vaccine with the combination of 360 ELISA- units deinactivated hepatitis BX-virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis C, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversions were carried out for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversions for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- until including 15-year-old, 142 two doses ambitions and 147 the standard combinationists with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immunology was worthless, the Seroprotective marry (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dosage is significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunology, which were achieved in a clinical study case at 1- to 11-year-old a month after completion of the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations either received a 2-cans vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination scheme with 360 ELISA units deinactivated hepatitis-A-virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of pridimmation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambitions in the 0-6-month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction against both antigens was comparable to that, after vaccination from 3 doses with a combination of combinations, consisting of 360 ELISA units deinactivated hepatitis - A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- until including 15-year-old could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year at the same time with the refreshen, a combined politicular, inactivated politicular and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine was administered (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mask-mumps dropping was adequate to all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a blaming face, yellow skin and / or eyes (Yellow searches) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child will already be infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus. (although you / your child does not feel unarguably or ill), a vaccination may not prevent a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those after a Hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, can not be conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of an infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis-A-virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B-surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccinosis of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered for one month after the first dose and may provide you with your child a vaccination protection prior to termination of the vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is suffering from individuals who suffer from heavy blood clashes, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened / her child due to a disease or treatment in your body's body resistance, or if you / your child are underlining a tick-analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so a blood test can be required to see how strong the response to the vaccine is.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be, however, that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine, and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate bodies and as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambition should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">In addition, Ambirix pregnant or nursing women is not administered unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated with both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since the division of the first approval for the market place, the CHMP opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for ambitions have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix had only been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonk can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete Enzymective or with hyperammonary encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high seeds) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonl is divided - divided into several single pants to meals - swallows up among the food or via a gastrostomachieschlauch (through the abdomen in the stomach leading tube) or an nasal (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammondy could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a hypothetical medication, i.e. without a substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonets can also lead to appetite in blood, depression, stimulability, headache, hydration, hydration, nausea, nausea, rash, rash, incineration, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) led to the conclusion that Ammonaps on patients with disorders of the urinary cycle effectively prevents stress levels of ammonious weight.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "Ammondy was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as due to the rarity of the illness at the time of approval was limited to this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicative in all patients, in which a complete zymchangel has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifle form (incomplete Enzymerict that manifests itself after the first age of life), there is a indication for use when in the anamnese is a hyperammonary encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early maniac defect-synthetase or ornithintranscarbylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency need arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered in patients with difficulty disorders, as a risk for the formation of osophagulcera if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g Natriumphenylbutyriat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS therefore should be used in patients with socialised cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium-formation-related clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium polyphenyl butat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure, only with extreme care.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindications (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gift from phenylacetate at young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of the neuronal multiplication and to a tightened loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturity of cerebrals synapses and a reduced number of functioning neurons in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined if Phenylacetate is eliminated during the person's breast milk, and for this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the downtime (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS stood at 56% of patients at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorektic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lacacias, heavy mortalkaline, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose stood at a 5-month old small-child with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed with intravenous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day an dosislimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolical active connection that is conjured by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that will take part in the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically is seen Phenylacetate glutamine with urea (both connections contain 2 nitric oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be accepted that for each gram monet sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phenylacetate nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment will start immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms associated with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always infaust, and the disease led even in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with its sticking-free analoga inside the first quarter of the year to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hermodialysis, the utilization of alternative pathic acids (sodium polyphenyl butate, sodium and sodium polyphenyl, it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new borrowed by postpartal (however within the first month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammony encephalopathy, the survival rates was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifle form of the disease (including female patients with heterozyginal shape of the ornivorian bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonary encephalopathy and afterwards permanently treated with sodium polyphenyl butyriate and a proteinous diet was the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the case of treatment and some patients may arise further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjured in liver and kidney enzymsch with glutamine, whereas Phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and his metabolites in plasma and urine were found after gift of a single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyriate in sober healthy adults and with liver cirrhosis after items as well as repetitive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its Metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous Gabe (up to 2 g / m ²) or Phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single-dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrat in tablet form were found 15 minutes after ingesmeasurable Plasmakonzentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular, branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early maniac defect-synthetase or ornithintranscarbylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.6 mmol) sodium per gram Natriumphenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g Natriumphenylbutyriat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If Rattenfutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active Metaboite from phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain lesion.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorektic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lacacias, heavy mortalkaline, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically is seen Phenylacetate glutamine with urea (both connections contain 2 nitric oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative replacement for the excretion of surplus value</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the elimination of phenylacetate glutamine in patients with malfunctions of the urinary cycle can be accepted that for each gram monet sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phenylacetate nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the case of treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, decreased blood sugar to the heart), for example in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myokardinfarmyard (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (anomaly measurement value in electric cardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent clots in patients infected with one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Roughly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the sole proprietor in combination with a glykoprotan IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent clotting treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulant) and a GPI.</seg>

<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attack or Revaskcularization) after 30 days or one year as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected themselves to one PCI, Angiox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as heparin, except for heavy bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than yeast.</seg>

<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in the patient, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h increases.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI request, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bulletin of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of anox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous fixing of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole bolus gift from Angiox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values, the reformed and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusdosis should be measured rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided the 1,75 mg / kg Infusion dosage is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to one PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be employed a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, juveniles and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot process enough insulin for the regulation of the glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not able to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is a little bit scrimptuous of Humaninsulin, and the change means that it acts quicker and has a shorter period of activity than a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glycosylified hemoglobin (hbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type-1 diabetes was determined for six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering of HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the bloodglucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission appointed Sanofi-Avows Deutschland GmbH with a permit for the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdomen, ceiling or Deltamuskels or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukoneogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin-change, the insulin needs may be down in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active thickness, the brand (s), the insulin-yps (normal, NPH, zinkdelays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of treatment, in particular in patients with an insular diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoacias; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or a insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict physician supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of appearance of hypoglycaemia depends on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change from the switch of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that can increase the blood sugar activity and amplify the inclination to hypoglycaemic activity, orale antidiabetic, fever, fluoxetine, monooxidiine, obesity and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytika like scrubbing, cloning, Guanethidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenswear counter-regulation be fished or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on Reproduction-toxicity showed no differences between insucklinglulisin and humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is absorbed into the human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it reshaping after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the derived from clinical trials known of undesirable pharmaceuticals and sorted according to decreasing number of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the availability of availability).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentrations, benchness, overpriced dog, headache, nausea and heart knock.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy vord fails to switch the injections within the injection range, can result in a sequence a Lipodystrophy to occur at the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Serious hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a appropriately trained person, or treated by intravenous gift by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucose rainfall the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for serious hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose rainfall (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) and through the imitation of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at subcutters ga- be of insulin lulisin the efficiency occurs faster and the active time is shorter than in hue-maninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1-diabetes melia, TUS showed Insulinglulisin the therapeutically relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg or more disproportionate increase in glucose impact, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as fast as normalized Humaninsulin and the complete mitigation effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was apparent that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postpranal glycemic control is achieved as with humanised norminsulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before meal, a better post-randial control than with human norminsulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Is insulin lulisin 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as in human-norminsulin, which is given 2 Mi- routes before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) prior to the meal in comparison to human norminsulin, which was given 30 minutes (figure 1A) as well as compared to human norminsulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) prior to a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
