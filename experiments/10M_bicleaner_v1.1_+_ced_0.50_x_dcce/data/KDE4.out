the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by these readily available .
for more information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions ... open the card card tools and select the required module .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of down@@ fall , if available , delete .
the module filter filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s updated working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M building view in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to use extras DO@@ M tree show ... and then open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document displayed . as a default setting begins the display with the root section of the document , example : Docum@@ ent@@ Element , all the other knots are sub @-@ elements of this root box .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory at local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in calcul@@ ating folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . Tree @-@ Maps allows the display of size of objects in sli@@ pping structures . each object is proportional to its size . this size has to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it . thus , large files , even then can easily be recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands thou be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the tre@@ ad depic@@ tion a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . easier navigation possess the rectangle of useful colour and let@@ tering settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on display color mode , can be either depth for the easy detection of the bol@@ ts or illustration of another file , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be described with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is available at all , only if the area is available at all or whether the area of subordin@@ ate h@@ edges should occur . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rectangle .
in Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the magnitude of the entry . in the tre@@ ati@@ ation in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . it will be drawn to be no longer available under the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
as sharing the area of an application for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to us . in this context it is important for the shel@@ ving and for the avoidance of space losses due to always beneficial the surfaces are so in@@ separ@@ ating that justification are possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test of testing and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu among extras @-@ image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .

a simple to use camera body will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader who is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tising ; working together .
&amp; D came ; includes a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos , review and correct . the machining ability can easily be expanded with KDE Image plugins ( manual ) modules easily .
although &amp; digi@@ tising ; easy to use , it makes use of professional skills at your disposal . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color tree and all available modules support the raw conver@@ sions by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color@@ fully workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as eg . about the camera or the lens over which can be searched .
like everyone &amp; KDE ; programmes is also available &amp; digi@@ tising ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on supporting the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; D came ; try to make the mel@@ ting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the fault reporting system . all the information you are already entered here . follow the instructions to submit your report .
&amp; D came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; checking , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . however , you may soon ask questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should be familiar with this language therefore powerful .
you can also check the digi@@ tising ; homepage visit , to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; checking .
the best starting to get involved &amp; checking , is to register in the developer mailing list . instructions to register in the developer @-@ mailing list of &amp; checking came ; .
if you start &amp; checking ; for the first time start , you will be asked where to specify your images and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder , click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data saved . this path remains the same for all image sub@@ folders .
later you can add as much folder as you would like to . &amp; digi@@ tising ; will you use in addition as an al@@ kal@@ library . settings checking in the Colle@@ ctions
if you already have a picture @-@ collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures contains , as the basic folder . &amp; digi@@ tising ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will change . during the passage of the folder you get a progress window showing how to see this :
&amp; D came ; dur@@ ate recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you can no sub@@ folder , unless it is i@@ est in con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous folder . this allows you to embed extraordinary b &amp; checking ; complete a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take photos as symbols . you can change the photo by using any photo from the album and then use this on the folder symbol . more details about this can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; checking in ; your digital camera will set up . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can handle ; possibly also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ms and Ro@@ h @-@ operation .
a simple to use camera body will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader who is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tising ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; D came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , further software collection for digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras ass@@ t. g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with your computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port is slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ tising ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ th@@ x@@ if support to be able to read the preview images of digi@@ tised . EX@@ IF support is not available by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera users to see the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may seem to be nothing short or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to be checking out is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier than checking out ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; checking came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page games with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop the pictures everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , over the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the common areas : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . thus , the filter appears on the fil@@ ename only when this ind the toolbar can also be displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . these albums are saved according to folders where they were saved on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date when the album was first created , sorted , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .

this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images Ge@@ o data included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to later use of the list below . he works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; D came ; put a light in a separate window with which you can simply compare pictures . he works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , too .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lighthouse is added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the luminous table and opened its window . if you come back in &amp; digi@@ tising ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L extras .
from the thumb@@ toolbar you can draw the images you want to compare , to see in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small dart indicates you to see which copy in which window area is to be displayed . you can also compare them from the toolbar and then compare them to the other picture . you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to use quickly from a picture series . if you use pairs to navigate from the toolbar , then the two first pictures will automatically display in the areas for the same time . use the left mouse button on the left . the right edge image is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal solvents work directly from the ligh@@ thouses like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pre@@ views available in the light@@ box . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you have to click this click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; keep pushed . in the mode Preview will show both images the same image area .
the zoom works just as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and to zoom . this happens in both images when you are pre@@ viewed in the mode .
what is a digital asset management - apart from the fashion product ? digital components ? digital matter management considers every part of the process which has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos adop@@ ts , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital components . however , most of us do this , but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , use , protect and edit photos again . we consider the downloading , ren@@ ame , convert , convert , comp@@ lied , archi@@ ved , storing , waiting , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale Det@@ er@@ Management takes up , categorized , categorized , ass@@ ures , transform@@ ated , conf@@ ected and exports content that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot; quot ;
metadata are defined as data on data . metadata are available in accordance with your definition data , which provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you &apos;ll find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ tising ; the approach will save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guaranteed very quick search and secure archiving to the you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you have to cultivate something inside your system is the structure of information in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be arranged on your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drives &amp; etc . take note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation images can quickly be found via your location . if you are using enough photos , then you will apply sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use , then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files are not organized and you will then do not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing simpler . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a managed image .
we also recommend this option to save metadata in the setup page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ tising ; that ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget that , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which to change ? it provides &amp; checking that an metadata editor for a number of selected attributes are available . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now select any photo keywords , let@@ tering and an evaluation . of course you can choose all the images that will need the same attribute and then set the value then . you start at best with the rating or the leaderboard . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s now take key@@ word with keywords , key@@ word as you often proceed to other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ onyms for the same thing .
if you import the cat@@ alo@@ gical images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree will create images in the correct place . the trans@@ cription of the Hierarchy inside of the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling an under@@ tree on one another . the changed keywords are taken by &amp; digi@@ tising ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata re@@ ps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and cal@@ ender data are characteristic of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ate your metadata .
you just want to see most anyone your photos just let you see them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure how your photos will arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from distance not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you might even listen to the silence . so the cap@@ tion thus has changed your perception of this panoramic position completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit to Him about the mo@@ tive that you moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for himself .
with &amp; checking , you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE can even export it to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery . you will have to tell the story for the re@@ opening @-@ bt@@ edness no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find into another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train from the spatial presentation is already working with light speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innumerable and will be able to repeat in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also repeat the photos at the reception . you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; using the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and calls the practice to use copyrights , to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , thus also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information is available in the furnishings page of &amp; As audi@@ ted ; as a information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for manufacturers and authors ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . after that value it should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ ma nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for fibre @-@ line ) : linked to the author . examples of this can be title like : photographer photographer , freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . as this is a comment on the author , it must be filled with it as well .
Editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer can be listed here for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a store photo , then the group / Agency will offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change it . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals this protection is only very important for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection against it is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image once itself ; it will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .

of course we are not talking about CDs that can happen on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper bags or negative . in this section there is problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data creation company in the world , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must also trust CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your im@@ measurable way .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you use good Dis@@ ks and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . therefore , it turns your correct selection .
CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to errors even if you have just written it . therefore , they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection , it requires by chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CD and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppy disks , disks , Flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ orium against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixteen the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
then burn slowly with a good recording on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ sufficient format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and protected on animals protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
dis@@ manufacturer retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google presents to this issue a big field study on the troubles@@ hooting of hard drives : dis@@ error study
in brief : Dis@@ ks maintain the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ed range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . in lower temper@@ ing errors , the error rate increases the most common fault of error , SMAR@@ T may not notice these errors . these are especially legi@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publisher . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the complete loss due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric failure before you have secured the files but these losses can usually be produced without major problems .
while most electrical devices power cuts not a lot , it looks different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process . these can cause serious harm . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause per@@ t@@ amper@@ ed key@@ boards , complete data loss , destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the in@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by the energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not any plug @-@ ins can also contain an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum protection . you should also take care of protecting the flash against flash and thus protecting the properly connected devices .
since a over@@ voltage of each cable is used to your computer , you should be careful that also all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers pose a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will provide you with a complete loss not really help . even an accident of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a lower power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a power loss occurs . some models allow them even further to work until the current runs again . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are filled with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the battery life and the attached software is interesting .
concern yourself the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety during electricity disorders , with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your machine protects it . at the end you should always remember all the cables before you travel to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; to use Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that you can store any amount of data .
you are at home in comparison to the hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively long @-@ slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution but it is not a general security solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online store services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version is much more available , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should only be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically reconc@@ iled thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offering a backup and a partial storage . thus , they are dis@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integr@@ ator between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all of these mal@@ functions remain un@@ discovered until you have not been destroyed by one day . nobody seems to have been thought in your computer . nobody seems to have been thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supply are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems this errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems appears to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors on low levels and is available under one of the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ al file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the theft amounts 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think . it is currently limited to fewer damage than theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time , no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Ex@@ erc@@ ises , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call on the common fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ator at a sudden break during operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . if a file has not been completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the root causes for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smoke characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 me@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ ic sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for comp@@ actors and the final result is more wor@@ sen@@ ing for comp@@ actors . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
an 7@@ 50@@ GB disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other loss for data loss . so do your data frequently affect a plan and test this backup before you can do something else just like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard disk drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes , you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget Air@@ craft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs up to the neighboring building , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a full copy at a time .
differentiation : a complete snapshot of the files have been changed since the last complete payment . generates a full snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last time . it creates several moments . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only secluded and non @-@ continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync just the difference of files that were really changed . this is done and if you want to increase security about s@@ sh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come out for the backup however with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every further out@@ going should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , stored on the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , reuse pictures and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you genuinely interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you need to consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option considered to be compatible with caution . unfortunately , there is no other option considered to be compatible with the current system . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always increasing .
let &apos;s go that you have been holding the scal@@ ability with bearing and the area you want to enlarge at a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
check the command d@@ m@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; dollar ; dd / sd@@ c # source is / dev / sd@@ c # Source is / dev / sd@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 .
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software more you can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save a lot more . it is ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can have gam@@ ma information but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as image format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . however , there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw @-@ format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of metadata . a handful of camera controllers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with enlargement &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can happen to problems when you link between the metadata file and image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards , supporting a large area of usage purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work of architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the cam@@ er@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fin@@ red editing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; checking , then you should add the metadata again . these were sub@@ cut@@ ted by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only to Web@@ gal@@ eries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos inside &amp; digi@@ tising ; you will find a description of how to add photos , which you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tili@@ zer appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not appear thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol of file attach@@ ments are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information available .
the rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufactur@@ er@@ remark , GPS etc . the image . this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tising ; or the image processing . note that these metadata are not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from you . this loads all the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ tising ; when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before installing the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired with the default output methods of &amp; KDE ; once you selected the photos , use the button Download and then download the selected item . the button selected is selected as long as you selected some photos .
if your camera is supported this , an option is new to download . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tising ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the pad@@ lock . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you use the buttons All download or chosen to download it , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album , shown in the photos . details on the folder sorting you can read in the section My records . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; D came ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all deleted from the camera . if you want to delete all of them , you need to select them first and remove the delete selected .
note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the trash bin of &amp; KDE ; they were completely deleted before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them completely from the camera . if you want to delete them completely from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , since this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename often not particularly expres@@ sive names . these fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos of the camera were deleted . therefore , it can be recommended to double fil@@ ename in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ory @-@ based sub@@ missions . if you use this latter option automatically , one folder is created per day .
the options Whi@@ le the transmission opens three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard authentication fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use for example in the machining field the pre@@ fix photo - % m@@ - % % H : % M . switch to the option Date &amp; Time Add . for more adjustments you should read the help of the command .
if you use the option camera file , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; checking came ; for a photo used , is displayed below the name which provides the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used when you open the camera door .
&amp; digi@@ tising ; may use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time record , to carry out an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras make this information ready . in section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually enabled , and if your camera does not supply this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera is made information about the date on which the photo has been made available , can be made available to download automatically . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section page meta data you can read what information your camera can be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ tising ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch to this option and select the option dates at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is to download . select the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; KDE ; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
after the choice choice is done , asks &amp; digi@@ tising ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the high load . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to o@@ graphs an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was made , you can open with one click of a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to locate the place of the photo therefore , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to transmit the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 are supported , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally over the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or through the transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo

&amp; D came to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that set the behavior of &amp; checking . to set up on these settings , you need to set up on these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
promotion can be selected based on embedded preview or editing image editing . they set up the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tising ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected when downloading the camera file . also with a database synchronization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
car title is a syn@@ onym for fibre @-@ line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be ( s ) as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description on the author , this must also be filled .
Editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to define the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a photo agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here as these are the other &amp; quot ; an@@ ec@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a store photo , the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this will be achieved that the metadata are permanently available in the picture and not only arrived in the database of &amp; digi@@ tising ; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; checking .

the page settings contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse pointer in the main window of a file rests . depending on the chosen option this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tising ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; checking came ; indicate , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove any file in one &amp; checking account ; Alb@@ um@@ folders , which has none of these extensions , ignored by &amp; checking .
the default settings can be recovered , by pressing the button Up@@ dating right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance can be placed on this page . every time you can then open the lumin@@ aire . some pictures have however different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size S &amp; quot ; if you have one , then you can get better vision results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch the toolbar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors will be set here . in the picture processing the View Mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images can be co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate explanation .
with the setting PNG @-@ Com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation is not reducing the image quality since PNG . this is the only effect that the image data is more time for training and packaging . if you have a quick computer , you can use this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF files , you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ mon for TIFF pictures . this reduces the size of the TIFF . it has no influence on the image quality because the de@@ br@@ ate algorithm is temp@@ ted @-@ free .
with the adjustment of the free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can edit it freely . even if you choose the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata were not yet supported , but was in the planning stage .
in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image processing was only a picture @-@ considering for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard gain is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option with a minimum loss of ul@@ tra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 lat@@ tice patterns with the V@@ NG@@ C or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used immediately of the camera . otherwise , if used , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the whit@@ eboard is not set right . standard is it a fixed balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details appear in the slide show . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ red@@ der , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera you begin to view the slide show , as it shows the c@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ at@@ rains . lastly , you can try to re @-@ construct some parts of missing information from the sh@@ ew@@ ays .
this is possible because blue pixel generally does not move so fast s@@ ati@@ le like green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option to re@@ construct a level , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each picture individually .
set the L@@ umin@@ aire value to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tising ; image processing is made . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial fil@@ tered image sensor that have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; D came ; and D@@ zi@@ w sets you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color boards at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution using an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the rot@@ or and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ resolution corrected , since you are carried out during the trial .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tising ; information like the colour information of a color tree in the other are to be translated as accurately as possible .
conduct questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Are you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / color / user / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tising ; examine this folder then during the Star@@ ts .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed while opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color@@ fully does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain dy@@ ton@@ ed or gam@@ ma correction . currently , this means that you do not have to perform the color mapping for you .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has been given off from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer can handle a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore highly saturated . this could be manually correct , rather than to rely on the fl@@ ashing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
the Canon profile expands the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; KDE ; images and image editing . by installing this interface can &amp; digi@@ tising ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then loaded from &amp; digi@@ tised ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of preview .
short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the top regul@@ ator settings should be simple to understand . the top regul@@ ator should be easily understood the time between the image processes , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crosses on the metadata , turn off the metadata in the lower end of the images during display .
the camera properties display on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image mode . currently here are the port settings . currently here are serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire par@@ ked memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , where you can attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it into the ad mode .
try out whether or digi@@ tising ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera amo@@ del and Port manually after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option of confirming dialog for the slide of &gt; images in the trash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; checking ; when deleted a photo in an album . in the sections deleted from a photos and deletion of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ kl@@ ed by &amp; digi@@ tising ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to change the changes with the button change .
you can also specify the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tising ; in case of start@@ up . this speeds up under the start @-@ off process of &amp; checking .
the adjustment Bei@@ m starts to search for new photos and digi@@ tising ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; checking out ; if something was deleted from the basic folder , asks &amp; digi@@ tising ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tising ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is en@@ umer@@ ated below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tising ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improve . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the advertisements .
the image processing contains a number of tools to enhance your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tising ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in section image editing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , fil@@ ename , and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar on the top edge and below the toolbar to quickly access the most used functions .
the machining function of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the original photo or the button save from the toolbar . note that you can not restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should be able to customize a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save save as a file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the menu File Recovery or the button The button Res@@ cue the image processing restore the image processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting the Edit Re@@ placement or restored by selecting Edit restore from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z , to return and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore it .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; above the back @-@ up or restore button in the toolbar you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also und@@ o or restored .
once you started the editing process , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar . if you made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or use the entries in the menu menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar icons automatically select
view full screen mode , the photo shows in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you do not want to edit the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the setting dialog from &amp; digi@@ tising ; change this can be taken from the &amp; checking of this window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu File menu and get the standard &amp; KDE ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . entire images can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ porting printers . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions available for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , even in the editing process . it is displayed when one of the five hor@@ semen is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same tab will appear in the side@@ bar or disappear into the edge .
in the label view , you can insert let@@ ins with unlimited size or insert them . note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters will be defined . if you want to use the IP@@ TC over@@ l@@ ating field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions .
after having commented it , you can either use the button or simply change the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the apply @-@ button , there is a button More . with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata adjustment which is always written into the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select this off and use the context menu .
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the schema in the following table :
the keywords showing a search box for the filtering of the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ tization .
the key@@ word @-@ tree is dynamically adapted to the search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords at a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by markings of the corresponding bond fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main menu and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this only appears on the highlighted picture and not applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - , cat@@ ch@@ or and su@@ pre@@ views . if in addition one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two is displayed . all the keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop your keywords in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords which was reduced the amount to three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched between settings too .
if you have a rule with and created you will find that it &apos;s a or being , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to be searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example you can specify a extended search across all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options are then shown as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; digi@@ tising ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
the reason why you use a colorful workflow using the colors that are actually photographed from your camera or scanner . with a colored workflow , you can achieve that colors on your monitor use those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web are conform to those from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic comes to color management , everybody wants to know which buttons it must push for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions on each point of image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to give you links with deeper information make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image are met all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB mode . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if the R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone so easy , why should one use a different color tree and thus have to make thoughts about shades of color ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ i@@ tization of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ e@@ ous region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional reproduction of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I put my monitor to my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working at the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you have to work your Monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ g@@ ate , since s@@ R@@ GB means that your ; on@@ itor is installed on s@@ R@@ GB , then you have to use your monitor at s@@ R@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try to get further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic and contrast expand out of the menu cor@@ rigi@@ er Automatic correction is automatically trying to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which affects the best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method involves the lumin@@ osity values over the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
equ@@ ated : this method re@@ eds the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hal@@ o@@ gram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces just rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which causes a wonder at a picture or destroyed it .
automatic sc@@ anned : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . you determine the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channels on the complete ho@@ ist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible areas and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible when used images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ eboard line of &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ like of a photo .
the whit@@ eh@@ ole correction is somewhat limited because of a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can therefore perform too far from the original picture , in case you can perform the white @-@ like in the blank mode , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better .
this tool is based on a whi@@ ch@@ equ@@ in@@ age of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m . they start it with the menu entry of white lacquered colours .
the screen saver can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the image . the Preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ p right again , then it is enough to click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the destination photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ator of pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the H@@ ist@@ gram .
to the right above , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram appears that dynamically changed as soon as you change a parameter . this H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful there , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ines have . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ator .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadows can be used to enhance your photos or also download them .
An@@ stat with the above controls should play , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then go anywhere on the picture @-@ show to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the whit@@ ef@@ oot . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indi@@ indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of pixels is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is shown in the Preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
to save the buttons as well as loading exactly this . each setting of the white can be set , you can save it in a text file and then load it later .
the kno@@ b button pres@@ upp@@ oses all filter values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white . please note that neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will change .
you can set here the encoding panel per colour channel of the supplied image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high quality pictures . this co@@ ding requires also more turn@@ around , dat@@ ac@@ tation and is just available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens up the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles . colour can be done through the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be noted in Chapter Color management .
another important tool is available in the menu among colors sound correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same correction , therefore you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful option of exposure problems is the tool for engra@@ ving that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a bike via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a be@@ holder .
in times of chemical processing , solar lization , also Sab@@ ati@@ er is called , an effect of the model developed by a short flash . this had the effect that the brigh@@ test areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool permits you to adjust the image neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase finally generates a neg@@ ativity scene that is not to produce on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar @-@ effect effects . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ a ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a s@@ ati@@ fying effect that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilli@@ antly and g@@ lowing . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light , turned color film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ a ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong saturated colors are also some photographs , especially those which hardly eas@@ ed landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in big images the filter can hold the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color of color and illumin@@ ate the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your permission are happy to preview you in the preview below . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo of bad light conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem : a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool engra@@ ving and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool of sound correc@@ tive to the improvement of the exposure . even if the dialog on this tool seems very complicated , you need for the purpose specified here only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der beneath the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
the window contains a graphs of the intensity , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der to the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright fields .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is the regul@@ ator to move and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image will be looked at . the Preview will be dynamically based on the settings of the picture . on the left side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this com@@ bo box can be set if the holder is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is frequently dominating the linear representation of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is usable .
three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values , e.g. for input values . compression of output values can be used e.g. for it to create a hidden image as background while taking something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the images are automatically set according to the intensity of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the embedded values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded again . this becomes the Gimp level format used .
if you use this mode and the three color tab@@ s , the input values will automatically be adjusted to all shadows , resources and sun sounds . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ als .
the option of over@@ exposed indi@@ indicator controls all colours in order to be over@@ exposed and to display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , the half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification Channel : this com@@ bo box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
beside this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that were taken using a digital camera is usually linear mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is helping .
if you move e.g. a cursor to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes with dar@@ ker output powers , and that the associated image was dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original photos is to see a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve displays the original value . create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each turn that you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp curve @-@ format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ples -@@ buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option of over@@ exposed indi@@ indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ ce canal . shadow and sun sounds are placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ Mix@@ er of the &amp; D came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photo .
the channel mix@@ er is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
using the channel sel@@ ector , you can select the color for the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left panel of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to the own tab .
the preview of the target area has a red marker . if you position this in the picture a vertical line is displayed in the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram to show you the corresponding color .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you can also keep the corresponding color components , as the channel mix@@ er then DA@@ S tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos is . try to reduce the green canal for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ru@@ stling , which occurs in the colour canal and whose smoking pattern looks different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion thereby in which you can reduce the color .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option of over@@ exposed indi@@ indicator controls all colours in order to be over@@ exposed and to display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white was a working step , because colour images can be converted to the machine . even with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .

green filters : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good in all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portrait against heaven . so similar to 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ tered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ pictures . thus similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic sky @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light on the day time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rot@@ ors .
gel filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color visual correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the shadow of a pressure and the res@@ ale in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to apply to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop style portrait of enlarged points or like a wall @-@ picture on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper editor effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter is set to 200 .
using the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ et@@ ching eye . under the frame frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired cream type for your image . thoroughly trans@@ duc@@ es the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce enc@@ ore it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , cr@@ ashed it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ off effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value @-@ area for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the scope of dec@@ ori@@ tised target will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you cut the tool After aspect ratio previously .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text device , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select the character size of the image size . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is ready .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool sh@@ abl@@ one apply you can put a template over a picture .
the menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put circuits on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG format and should be added with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . whom you want to add your sten@@ cil of the file size . whom you want to add your template in English to the &amp; checking account ; mailing list checking came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button Base Fol@@ der . select the folder in which you have copied the folder files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for the template has been set , a building view , which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
beneath the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying image . it is centered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button res@@ ized the underlying image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to scale the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture under the template . take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be matched to the default size .
&amp; D came ; provide three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharp@@ ly . actually , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ually . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common colour . this in turn leads to a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if shades are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras require more tigh@@ tening as normal cameras for private users .
black pictures often have a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the shell @-@ format on the other hand must always be used during processing .
some scanner turn a shar@@ pen@@ ed filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable it , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by calling for a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect . this allows you to call with the menu entry of cor@@ rigi@@ dity .
but they should deal with this but the results are not very natural ; the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the ru@@ stling technique for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of an image the tool re@@ focus . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is a cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry of cor@@ rigi@@ dity and experiment with something with settings . the front panel on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview picture shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are frequently generating good results and should first try out . an increase in radius or of the amount reinforce the effect . if you create the bl@@ ur mask , ru@@ stling and the impression of gr@@ aten in the proximity of sharp edges are generated .
the radius is one how many pixels on each side of a edges are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the bl@@ ender image one of the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the Corpor@@ a value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . one can thus define a minimal difference thus for a channel of the filters . in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty in faces , He@@ av@@ ens and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sle@@ eve = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to be protected by the copyright algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to bl@@ unt . this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . they usually use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus mostly better results as un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by entering colors re@@ focuss@@ ing in the image processing .
in practice the circular f@@ ission works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which depends far from the original squee@@ zed pixels . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular f@@ ission . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results . you can bet a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then on hal@@ o .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is even more bl@@ aded the picture .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . this is most often caused by a bl@@ ender filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smo@@ ker filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ rix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you choose great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ing parameter that you set will have set it for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all tri@@ mmer , color and integer correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red masks produce better results as raising it . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ onry always must generate art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filter at least as good as the bl@@ ender mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture was made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about the methods for the field of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te is the im@@ acu@@ ity of the area of the sh@@ ading , to generate a natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the color cloth allows for a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image inf@@ alli@@ zed is one of the most developed tools to not remove the desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the in@@ tra algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the options available are below :
if you want to adjust the filtering settings , you can use the rider smo@@ o@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to an ev@@ enly smo@@ o@@ thing about the image . and a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is required . please note that the detail @-@ keeping always should be subordin@@ ated .
set @-@ dependent alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ularity , or the CCD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ e@@ facts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gl@@ itter factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smo@@ o@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of smoke in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : returns how often the algorithm is going through . usually there is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm .
angular as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , there should also be small chosen . make sure that small angles can produce a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de @-@ wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smo@@ o@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More on Quality you get through Sel@@ ection of this option is only minor . he doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to him .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load to move . therefore , you can cancel the calculation any time with the button ab@@ ort .
below you can see how to remove images with small arti@@ facts . the module is placed on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey is wur@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking came ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable filter filters available to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensory escape from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ards ; effects of sc@@ anned images of books or magazines .
if you need more information about Sensor@@ ting cameras of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular smoke which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius is controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel required and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is moving over the image and color in it is smooth@@ ed and hence minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the filter . this value requires the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ t the filter appears to determine fluor@@ escent filters . you may have to re @-@ adjusted the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and ru@@ stle or black@@ berries again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or smo@@ kes can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watch@@ man or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts , without losing details .
ligh@@ tness : controls the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ o@@ thing process which is controlled through the details settings .
color : controls the shade of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ o@@ thing process which is controlled through the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ones , which typically are ampli@@ fied ampli@@ fied , but he also spends the shadow ranges .
d@@ amping : monitors the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted when it is too high can occur . if he is up to his minimum , spac@@ ers and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur in the edges . he can remove spac@@ ers and is the recommended method for it .
save below and loading : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smoking reduction that you have set can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how a smo@@ kes@@ creen can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected one with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is to be cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry of cor@@ rigi@@ dity and experiment with the glasses . the front panel on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo results .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of und@@ es@@ irable arti@@ facts of your images . it is very well adapted to show gau@@ ge &apos;s gra@@ zing , scratch @-@ pressed and local errors that emerge in digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ tised images . the smo@@ o@@ thing takes place along the image cont@@ ours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and textiles . the text replacement is done with a different tool , the inf@@ alli@@ graphic image , the algorithm for restoration was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ella and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compres@@ s@@ ages , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ facts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude shall correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . any setting of photo Rest@@ oration can be saved into a text file and later loaded again .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can reduce as a photo with DC @-@ shaped smoke . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ularity on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo Rest@@ oration . this time textures has been reduced to an old color picture that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts identified by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows the hot@@ spot from photos which were gem with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the pictures .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to absorb the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . please note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result . the preview picture shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all the view@@ points .
select an area to view the broken pixel and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is calculated as an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional interval , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
k@@ ub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ische surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ische curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ spot correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correc@@ tive is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , one image .
vast@@ ly objective , especially the medium @-@ sized and large photo format , often the whole sensor sector cannot be ev@@ enly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ work@@ men ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there . tele@@ objective may also show this behavior .
but he also has cons . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . vast@@ ly items should use , also using center filters , an opening of f / 16 or small , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive effects arise through movement .
with the large popularity areas of today &apos;s film and colour @-@ depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ ta@@ ion transformation in a raw image that is used without this filter . the tool of vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ation applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier tube and with three further expos@@ ing the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ osity at the point of the biggest density the fil@@ ters . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ing , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lighting strength , contrast and gam@@ ma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correc@@ tive reduces the ligh@@ tening of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values because you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a hos@@ tile re@@ fine of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correc@@ tive to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ing in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ osity and contrast correction was also carried out at the picture with this tool .
the &amp; checking came ; Lin@@ ear distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of cel@@ esti@@ al lenses on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colorful distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient treats the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ exe form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect , but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gradient . if you combine these two can be eliminated almost eliminated each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion .
generally , this value checks the strength of the distor@@ tion second gradient . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of f@@ eces .
corner : this value checks the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value acts stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted prec@@ ursor of the parameter .
zoom : this value scale the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient . negative values enlarge while positive the image has decreased .
brigh@@ tening : this value read@@ ed the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correct . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values .
the tons or ho@@ ver@@ tical correction should be done before all tri@@ c@@ ision or size changes . best perform this correction as all first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparent to the f@@ langes .
to help you find the best correction to help you display this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the tons / paste with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cr@@ ash @-@ shaped distor@@ tion the resulting image will have black corners . you can transform it using the tri@@ mmer tool in the menu , cut it from the image processing or via the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
for most pictures the tons @-@ shaped correction ranges from the front . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ guru . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range from 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the window of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film gran@@ ularity and film@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows will be white as snow !
since the filters can produce colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of infrared cinem@@ atic effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter film gran@@ ularity is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ularity on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of movies , the makers mix large silver @-@ bas@@ kets of the photo@@ em@@ ulsion .
the film gran@@ ular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . in case you want this specific , gallery @-@ like , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins are calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bas@@ ins , so you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ular effects applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter oil painting , creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyrighted protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and styl@@ istic life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin@@ ching size between one and five out . thicker brushes are suitable for big images . smooth controls the smo@@ o@@ thing or , from the other side , considers the uniqueness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is with the ( 1 ) and the processed is equipped with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ ät@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensity , to generate a calf in the drawing . the lines whose gradient can change slowly therefore are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ching you . this would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value @-@ range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smo@@ o@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adapting the performance value .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stri@@ ped in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ e@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and leaves it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a artwork by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ks the picture along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that go from a center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur a zo@@ om@@ iting camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in the photography photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image by rotation of the pixels to a central point . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ender of a rotating camera .
remove in@@ sti@@ ff : bl@@ ur@@ ks the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
motion inv@@ oked : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train to photograph , camera .
soft@@ box nonsense : twi@@ sted the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright killing . this is created photos with a dream@@ y and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ev@@ ine : bl@@ ur@@ ks the picture by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a random camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the colour sink in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a real look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number is changing the number and density of drops . fishermen changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ tising ; image editing a range of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face , which shall be free to stay . if you start to the filter drops , the area will stay free of rain drops .
this is an example of rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform turning or transform mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you keep an image infl@@ atable and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ atable .
many image processing programs use one type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tising ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are considered below :
aspect ratio keep it : if this attitude is enabled , entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly . each entry fee for photo can be enlarged as a text file and later loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating , by adding a small colour image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magnific@@ ation as compared .
adding a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to simply create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle . you will then see this rectangle then you &apos;ll see the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again the area of the photo will cut off the way . you can change the size of the triangle after cutting . you can change the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle can be created by simply clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button The dial @-@ button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save File Save File Save button to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
you can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse by moving the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue .
in the tool After page @-@ ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use inches , inc@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog box exist two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in dialogue you can use the Max . relationship to the area to cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizont@@ ally or vertical ) . if you use the random tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image .
the settings of co @-@ operation help enable help to put them better together in order to put your images better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic partial forms are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the Third el@@ re@@ gel , harmonic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
Golden middle : the golden middle is a division that overlook various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shells , or the ten@@ ders of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used their temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 13 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 . 1 composition which is usually follows as visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides liquid aid lines if you put an image together . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring your goal good results for your photos to get closer . compared to the third party , the golden spiral generated a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule are the rectangle of the golden spiral , also called Golden rectan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye appears at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without being the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the above golden spiral angles . your ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the pages of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , Golden tri@@ angles are not a h@@ ind@@ ent tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal the lines can place a st@@ ati@@ ous object of dynam@@ ical .
if you want to cancel a golden triangle to set out your frame you create an effect of a professional photo @-@ graph dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your picture fo@@ sters at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical can be used to reflect the harmonic partial components .
with the button color you can set the color of the Help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy if you &apos;re not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which things are directed to an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; checking ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform it into free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this shoot are specified in degrees . with the button pre@@ preferences you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
for your help , the module provides free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse pointer to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transform@@ ing cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn . however , consider the above warning .
all prospective transformations are conducted by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the Preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas which have been created through transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas which have been created through transformation in pixels .
angle on the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle on the left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adapting the perspective the image becomes a little wast@@ ed . for individual adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the image to capture , cut out of the image processing .
the track tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no spin , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a Parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module over transform@@ ers .
check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press the settings , the angle will display on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the thumb@@ nail .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the folder tool to adjust your image .
after which you have performed the shot , the picture becomes a bit confused . for a single shot this effect is usually neglected , but two sh@@ aliz@@ ations created twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after installation , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform it into image processing .
&amp; D came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages for image formats to read and write . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries were comp@@ uted . in most distribu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; checking .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; D came ; shows only files in formats that are known . this is done by the file expansion and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ tising ; accepted . configuration can be found in the configuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose to select the format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia , supports both formats .
image repression is the application of data compression to digital pictures . here , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save this way the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression level . the 200@@ 0s version can also be loaded freely when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can read raw @-@ format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ on@@ kon@@ verter by &amp; digi@@ tising ; convert further information about the use of modules with &amp; checking .

&amp; E@@ graphically viewers ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in the inform@@ atics . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visualize graphs . the programs that obsol@@ ete graphs &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program .
&amp; E@@ graphically viewers ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; od@@ ot@@ us ; programmes are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewers ; shows graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; to . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; graph@@ ene re@@ es and in &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; represents )
menu , in order to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; bio@@ graphical viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphically viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs are required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; without an argument , the toolbar can only open the icon file and the ( blank ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the Grap@@ h is larger than the character area . you can choose a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum loading of a graph .
if the file was created in &amp; E@@ graphically ; loaded file from another program is displayed , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change , so your decision will also remember , so that later also procedures will change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graphical viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; graphical viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or to present the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can permanently store your choice but also change it with the furnishings dialog .
when you start the program you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later change .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph you want to come to this page . here , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several sides Grap@@ h without header and with another font
the Contact site gives the possibility to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; if a graph is open outside a running session . you can open a standard behavior for that case ( the graphs in a new window ) or determine in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site seats gives the possibility to set up the start @-@ behavior of &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at any start .
the context menu , usually at one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , offers more possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries on how it can be described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graphs . the algorithm establishes the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ors as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for uneven graphs . it produces depic@@ tions under the spring@@ board model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for un@@ eri@@ ding graphs a jumping frame model layout . it uses the fru@@ ity puri@@ fier he@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ length trigger for the treatment of large and cluster graph@@ ed graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm establishes the no@@ des circular according to the description of six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several multi @-@ cycle structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or even the graphs using a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ challenged ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for odd graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed , provided that this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse pointer . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read tools available to invite new images and storing them .
this module can be used to invite new images to read and distribute new images from external sources : currently , two sources can be used :
pictures sc@@ ann@@ ahs : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading pictures of a scanner that is supported by SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you need K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
if you scan the menu entry pictures appear a dialog you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will be able to replace the pre@@ determined standard values to select your picture . see the preview below and adjust the area to your needs before you check the picture . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
be sure that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise possibly not be displayed .
after you have pushed the button scanning you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file . here , you can select the compression and type of image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image is to be stored .
screen photos can be created after being selected in the menu of impor@@ ters and scre@@ enshot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen shot :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program windows will be selected , the ascending program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have selected the complete work@@ space , just read the window under the mouse .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog Options of the target image with the options described above .

Flickr is an online photo @-@ management on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to show its photos to people that are important . you can show your favourite photos in the world showing the photos of your camera records online and show your photos safely and private your friends and family all over the world .
using Ex@@ porting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you use the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . it is thus virtually your ID to Flickr . a browser is started so that you can register with Flickr .
after successful registration , the module can send pictures to the Flickr website . you will be presenting the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed onto Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module is started from Flickr to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current permissions . the module currently supports no other permission . you will be asked if you wish to continue with these permissions .
the button Add Photo should once be pushed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select in a file sel@@ box the photos that you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flickr server .
the tags field can be filled with one by comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the picture as a tags during the flood .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ ous , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as a private .
if you choose the option change the size of the photos in front of the plateau , the photos are changed before high load in size . the size is made up of the maximum size of a registered size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size doesn &apos;t change the aspect ratio .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ qu@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the picture and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to locate pictures geo@@ graphically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphical localization P@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible cor@@ relation between time and localization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains of course data recorded at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera data is recorded with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone here . place your camera zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ ation . lies the devi@@ ation below the data will be combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then be cor@@ related any images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used when you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a local difference in a large difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog you need to use the coordinates by a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the locality can also be found and placed with the indicated map and enlarge . select this again and again through until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite channels and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums , which can be exported as HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders on which the settings can be customized . the tab allows you to select all the albums now . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically indicated . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly see a large number of albums at the bottom of the HTML page .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image is displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated pictures . select a folder that you typ@@ ed to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which includes everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with Other color depth you can change the standard color@@ depth . naturally , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails which are small images to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break the process down .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program@@ ings to determine whether errors occur during production . the web browser will automatically start in the end to preview the preview of the gallery . click Connect to join the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image consider is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool in order to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image does not allow you to look at a selection of pictures and to perform on them basic oper@@ ations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or de@@ ple@@ tion . the spect@@ ator can be used with shor@@ ts and mouse . it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG alter@@ ing free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the promotions listed below to save images in the JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool to enable you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ qu@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list of KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import @-@ function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image file you want to copy . this will then open the file sel@@ ector with which you want to copy the target folder . the data to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but do not write into any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please see exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages m@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base pattern . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all pictures will be automatically scalable to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first must select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start using extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module .
the pictures selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sort of images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can select from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe .
the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image metabolism .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the file created you can set under name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go safely or in complete peace and enjoy the slideshow once you are back .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Packages on the Settings button on the right .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper into standard photo@@ graphies . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.g. : sensible to improve you or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images into one of three formats of JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM or convert .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera performers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the re@@ w image window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button Preview can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white can be used . the essential parameters like gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the output results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W Com@@ pression .
if you are going to frequently edit your pictures or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ing . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adjusted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata are stored in the raw file contained in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the execute button start converting . if you want to cancel this process again , you can finish off .
the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful in case this one has been created in a former attempt . however , the progress bar is not available as far the conversion speed is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of time .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . these are available in four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the additional images before . more images can be drawn to the list of images and drop it there .
after having started the module , the images will display images with the pictures selected by you . over the button images you can add further pictures with a file sel@@ ector . for the last selected image will preview a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop images on the picture @-@ list and add you to the list of images to be found here .
the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be removed from the list below .
after you have selected all the images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are already attached to the App@@ endi@@ x .
be sure to send it too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the E @-@ mails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every time used again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selection of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ free formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should therefore use PNG if you have a quick Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG using pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format , then the original exception data will be added to the existing images .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can see the status messages , looking for mistakes . your e @-@ mail programme will be automatically started at the end . with the button Connect , you can switch this window ? s .
after starting the module &apos;s advanced dialog box appears a window with questions like your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the option of OpenGL transi@@ tions in presentation automatically activ@@ ates very elegant image outputs by means of OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics card because otherwise the slideshow is very slow .
the option file name indicates that the fil@@ ename can be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a repository loop . you can manually cancel it with Es@@ c ;
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not used the order of images in the album .
under the delay between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should try this before you show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect from any transition between images .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the preceding and the next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo album ; through this brow@@ ses , see image . as you can see by comparison with the picture , are now available in every group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you search your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images . in the following each one is described for itself .
if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see image .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images .
when you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your impact .
in the picture , every person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can store with &amp; photo album ; however , for each person has its own preview image , that of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button that you want to adjust to the right outside on the toolbar . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of individuals and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
you must however set yourself that image for each individual person will be displayed . to view this , you have to select the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can customize the image factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you call on the entry window , you will display a dialog box , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog can be viewed in the picture again .
if you enter a string into the field of let@@ tering or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you like , you can also be a date to be searched , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window , you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try out some features , you have the following alternatives to this hand@@ book :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and see the quick entry , the scre@@ enshot and the introductory videos .
start &amp; photo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , in case you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry . for example , some example images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display you multiple different time units . each bar shows you a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the Preview pane ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select one area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , you will only view images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo album ; put together two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; cold album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the software version is described in &amp; photo album ; integrated version that you can create using the menu HTML page .
before HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the survi@@ vor and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on cold album ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; photo album ; export file is to be created on the page page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that information is displayed by a party . for example , that you can use all the pictures from a party . for example , that you can use all images from a party . for example , you can use this setting therefore to hide specific images from certain points .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , which is why not specifically received on this .
bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . thus those who have to look at your website and have a monitor which supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images to download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he &apos;d like to show a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area you set the different folders and URL where your website is stored .
best to choose for all your HTML files , and then choose a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or folder by KDE supported protocol for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all for viewers . if you choose to select a URL for the basic folder . the URL you set up should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you &apos;ll need to manually copy them there . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have applied all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you define in output folder .
if you are interested in a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; however , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you &apos;re interested in an HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you need to write an HTML page , recording , then you must do with &amp; photo album ; this work doesn &apos;t even turn .
with &amp; photo album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image features are extern@@ ally and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored with the file or whether in the file only a short@@ cut to pictures is that you have all the images together and pass this file over independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu File Ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , it will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file search the images in two ways . first , the corresponding images are not found , so the images are displayed in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . these are of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is the dialog for the portra@@ yal of pictures described above the menu file Ex@@ porting ... can be called .
the main option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when option Manual near the .@@ k@@ in file you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; photo album , the pictures will be automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures were compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not require the files to comp@@ ress . if you want this , you can simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page contains maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by example that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File impor@@ ters ... select , the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for Im@@ ported consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to import images .
it may be that you are the category persons of the custom file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window to import the categories of imported goods and what categories are displayed in your database .
in the fourth step you can edit the categories of imported goods with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and watch images : if you see images , you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) Celeb@@ rate the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the through@@ s and prestige , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it will also take care of your videos . on many places in this hand@@ book there is spoken about pictures , but often this also closes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. standards backup tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they would like .
&amp; photo album ; notes the folder in which your pictures are stored and used automatically again in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo album ; so you can start a different folder tree with images , you can start a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings of the photo album , set up ... come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different icons where you can preview settings and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described to you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of explaining all groups of a medi@@ ator .
to view the settings , which you are at your disposal of the membership groups . with the above list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left of the fen@@ ders there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of categories .
&amp; cold album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; Image plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this hand@@ book because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , but are separately distributed . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves .
since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; demo database , you can either call on the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album entry \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications does not support their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates the order for albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; photo album ;
are sim@@ ulated &amp; photographed album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images , which shows you the picture preview .
in addition to the current album , &amp; photo album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s the photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you set in the setting dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you use the category persons , such as the category persons is used , so if you choose to have selected persons and pass this module to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setting dialog and choose in the area module , which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a laun@@ cher as soon as you start the photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as usual , you can see it from any other KDE application , see the window with which you browse your picture database . at the moment you will not see a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , now click on the picture pictures to show you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to display any picture with notes . this includes information about persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all the pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords , these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you can always use them again if you have information about your pictures .
the following idea is to move the images inside the list : if you have for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names you have moved upwards are to find the people faster and assigned .
if you prefer to view a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting after date below the list .
if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . click in this case simply to the front and back @-@ buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries on a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture , you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that this is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the catalogue is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry simply to one category and take place to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you just to sort out your category alphabe@@ tically . see this for you .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the proposition , by forming the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move from within a frame to drag it outside of the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also print a frame completely . if you want to get this window later again , use the button Options ... and then click on the window to read / out . this action can be seen in the picture .
if you want to display the entry pictures in the browser , you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or any images in case you have not set a filter here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply using the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be arranged as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture @-@ pane . in case you do not have a window with an image collection , a new ad image will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the pictures . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete or select either the Del@@ ete button or select either the Edit menu . now , the window will display you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also use pictures somewhere , without you saved on the hard disk . of course you have to record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; photo album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. present on the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , but for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails can be displayed . however , you can preview these pictures with the image concerned .
as you see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and paste it back . &amp; photo album ; therefore , it still does not support you to record the record of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid a hassle of how to avoid the mess of your pictures , please purchase a bigger disk in order to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you want to un@@ lock the images that you want to do for others . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that can see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ ves and select the menu item all out of current view .
with this you have specified which images are hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will be closed . if you want to get locked the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into the un@@ lock of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means safe . for example , all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete it . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to we@@ ars the view of private images .
the reason why you put all of your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and talk hours over hours to them is of course that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason you have to look at some picture _ and video views . this allows you to preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it naturally shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via the picture , such as who is on the image when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box at the top of the image you want to see , you can easily drag and disc@@ ard it with the mouse . you can also configure which information displayed and whether information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the context menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click on the browser , see the matching entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and picture below . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as di@@ sti@@ au . like often a new image invites you to be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . started and stopped the Di@@ asch@@ au through the buttons C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the observer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry key to switch to the full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can simply drag and pull out a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus button you can roll again zo@@ oming the plus button zo@@ omed into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key points the zoom , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and the key .
using the screen@@ play from the context menu , you can shoot the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you consider pictures it can happen to set a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set in the picture . in the moment you can view it off and open the configuration dialog of the image to insert this name . however , you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one .
for the two examples at the top of the observer gives you the opportunity to display images with characteristics while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can squee@@ ze a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view , you can see a picture of which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the characteristics of your images , these are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you can view categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can simply add features to the pictures by simply press the letters for the feature , after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you allow you &amp; photo album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your old old later .
in the game you can see a picture in the painted . to switch the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; to turn on the picture you can finish out of the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , you simply hit the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read it and understood it .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is shown in the Dra@@ ht@@ ar views yellow .
you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the under@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the menu entry .
are there multi@@ e possible positions , the following re@@ fold @-@ menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
with deletion from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click on to apply these changes . if you typ@@ ed un@@ locked values , a message will be displayed with a troubles@@ hooting . then you can click the input letters to apply again and to apply the changes to dis@@ rup@@ ting them .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; type of user documentation , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown by Help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview of the peculi@@ arity view .
press the preview of the character view and a small example of the scene is ra@@ ged with the chosen texture . when you want to select the whole texture , even if you want a subordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through drag the mouse inside the whole window .
each object has a visible level of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only appear if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the chosen level of visualization of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window mapping as a default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as desired . you can also save several shut@@ ters and simply switch between different versions .
to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the early water to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the early water to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then ens@@ hr@@ ined on the right or left side of this view and covers the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the early water in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on top in the views .
the last possible window of windows are des@@ crip@@ tive views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the early water to the desktop or click the small to the left top left arrow in the column bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the column bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for each type of views . new views are sil@@ ently , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window mapping ... store . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written , 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders The icon Ren@@ ate in the toolbar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ own a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of r@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it is a name that makes the properties of the mode .
in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you want to ren@@ ame only a small area of the picture , select the tick@@ ing section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality , you can select the properties that are used &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual on &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if a picture is posted with just one beam per pixel , there may be different bugs . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or piece effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , look better with this feature better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because every pixel always gets divided again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ring pins on the calculations depend .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray will per@@ sec@@ uted a Stra@@ hl per pixel . if the difference between the shades of pixels with super @-@ sampling is handled . if you adjust the depth to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colors the pre @-@ checked threshold , then the pixels will be checked individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can adjust whether the alpha channel should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object to be taken .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if an Pov@@ ray is terminated , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu entry to import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , not yet the complete command of the V@@ Pov@@ ray . if the impor@@ ters error messages or al@@ erts appear , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , please write this source code between the two particular comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object to import text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ces . usually , this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the individual view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the property &apos;s documentation page is displayed here . place the path to your documentation and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths towards the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if you refer to files that are not included in the folder of the scene , you also need to list the path to those files here . if a file appears in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rectangle of the view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
you can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Dra@@ ht@@ model views . you can set the R@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a closer wire model and thus a better sewing for the objects shown , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you want to show high detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all wires are advanced in advanced proj@@ ections . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you indicate a wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you display the floor , a floor is rounded below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ et@@ ables , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information regarding the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
this page allows you to change existing window versions or create new window arrangements . in the section window regulations , it is explained how you can create and store windows .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field Standard shut@@ ters : displays all existing window versions . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters displays all existing window versions . a new arrangement can create you with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button R@@ emo@@ ve .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window mapping . new views can create you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , using map card , you get a map display , together with the previous view and web@@ end the view does not fit in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just been installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a plane .
but you should read the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will get a black image .
when you insert no light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ assembled window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . thus , you now have a scene without any objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you see this in the fourth ro@@ ht@@ model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find more details .
don &apos;t change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you apply the button or press the button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these attitudes . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ ent body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a non @-@ concrete method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or button Enter . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model shows now also shows the level , although at the moment it is limited only as a limited period . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can see the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new item : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select the shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialog box where you can select how the object is inserted . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button Preview will see how the pigment looks right now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only displays a matt black material , because you can still specify settings for pig@@ ments . therefore always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way .
if you do not preview any color on Qu@@ ader and Ball , simply click on the button below and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you want to ren@@ ders your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color list . you are still further settings necessary . in the property list you have to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently but the chess board @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every@@ time and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics :
you should already simply run this step , since you should have understood the basic functionality of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the floor create :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the ball rolling or the button to apply ) , so the bul@@ let is float above the floor , since you have moved the ground to move down a unit down .
of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First object and change the name for example in Ball pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , select then mon@@ ar@@ n and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interest@@ ingly effects if you take the time , set some Finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen photos and click on it or press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &apos;re looking for &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a r@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ derer deri@@ ves from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which reflected the scenes ) through the objects in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as fog have effects . thus , the scene is adapted for pixels .
as you can imagine you &apos;ll see without a camera no , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be ra@@ ged , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is saved under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and space .
rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last stored will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeatedly the last pe@@ pper command . this menu entry is only then select if you have used Edi@@ tors .
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ els@@ ets ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or new ones .
opens up a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool commands with this option tool icons for &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
a B@@ ump map is a way to sto@@ cr@@ o surface finishes without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without change the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , by applying an image file as colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable image collection and browser @-@ browser . the application features a file browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ e@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or whether to use all images always the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name was found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in dialogue Set@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ball show ; set in the two other , shor@@ tw@@ ave and short command for the browser , can be set the keyboard short@@ cut for each window .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad space is filled with the background color that you can further down . default mode is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder while you look at the actual picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the end up the name of the last opened folder . at the next time the window opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image is , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; to set up that only a few of the file types are displayed that the program can also display .
with this option for large images the scor@@ eboard is enlarged to the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
notes if the slideshow is supposed to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is cancelled from the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; ball show ; in the box @-@ cards for the display window and short command for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the un@@ favorable view of the file system with folders and files in a window around .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
the image is enlarged by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
includes the scor@@ eboard for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; also closed if no Brow@@ ser@@ s@@ window is opened anymore .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the file name that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ pic ; is a &amp; KDE ; photo editing based on the &amp; checking came ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ piece ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tising ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; KDE ; is &amp; show@@ pic ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user is contributing to its part , at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; show@@ pic ; makes it possible to report you as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and requests . all required information is filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; show@@ pic ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ pic ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may soon ask questions of other users . in this mailing list is spoken English , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ pic ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that connect the behavior of &amp; show@@ pieces . to set up on these settings , you have to adjust the Settings menu in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicators should be selected . proj@@ ections should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ pic ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can view these display in which you click on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that makes no more power than scan and storing .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images , which no longer makes images to scan and storing . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store for each image a dialog for storing or storing the images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images from the store .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner .
the user can select the user to use@@ full scanner and click OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; Turn ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
to view an image , the user can only start a preview can start and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the thumb@@ nails will be started by the Preview button .
to better select the picture the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in the window that fits the complete preview into the window .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is shown in a preview image as shown below is displayed . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and shr@@ ink ? s leads to a break@@ age and you get back to the main window .
through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , prior to the Save . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way to save each image . dialog to save each image open the dialog from any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; they will automatically save it with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to save save without any fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option saving without after a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a sc@@ fix for the automatically prot@@ rac@@ ted images and is moreover , the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets added a numerical sou@@ ff@@ ix of every time a picture is stored . the string # # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality for saving image quality . this value also changes the compression value when select the image quality is not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t .
the button Help will start the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; guide . the button about starts KDE About @-@ dialog for &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings will display the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the player &apos;s right button and button . the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ gram can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command ... select .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . thus , make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features which mostly can be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP features of collection , context browsers , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . such a sample calls for the D@@ COP function .
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has still some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use it dialog so that the user ID , why a script does not exp@@ ire .
begin require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ Bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder script / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts , or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ eb@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is using the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each KDE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . in addition , the Ex@@ ec function is used ( ) function . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; send messages to all ongoing scripts . this is why scripts have to monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure shows the script to view the furnishings dialog . to save the Save and loading of the furnishings , there is a script to run . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ad shall put the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for eg ; with D@@ COP functions further information to the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer from 0 to 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ ff : sub@@ menu , revealing the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu item you can use . to add an entry menu , you can remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok Script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu &#93; d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok Script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; ended , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example . to do this , for example , the storage of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration may also install script packages that can be compressed also with b@@ zip@@ 2 . such packages are essentially normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which allows the user to detect the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages immediately .
the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to the lad@@ le modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file right :
if your script is finished , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . for your entry to KDE apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Skri@@ ll use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Colle@@ ct Browser and the Quick Search will find the piece inside seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the playlist is still difficult for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to hear your music . this and many more useful functions make Amar@@ o@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , you have to enter the bas@@ k folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ ad :
since &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; auto@@ bahn and v@@ ending machine , you should have when compiled any difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; KDE ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many options some options that you can activate or disable the comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled for them to be used . details about this can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble using the furnishings . the furnishings dialog has several cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
player @-@ window displays the player @-@ window in addition to play@@ lists , or out . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window is attached .
mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ad ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mo@@ ods .
atmospheric : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
permissions used in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ad ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ fr files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ o@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose the browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list .
playlist of storing , store the current playlist automatically with the ending of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; . enable this option when you want to lose the running playlist while you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , the Amar@@ ok ; relative paths towards the music files , from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece during the piece of bat@@ ches , it causes the play@@ lists @-@ windows to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
change the text @-@ change to the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the look @-@ picture you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s look for appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ sections .
in the fonts section , you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can choose fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player @-@ window and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you even have the tor@@ ment of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the included color selection for front and background color .
playing at the start brings about that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the final schedule .
the on @-@ screen display screen allows you to use the OS@@ D window . if on @-@ screen display is set , a preview of the OS@@ D will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Out@@ put ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the tick@@ le shadow causes that the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
own colors will give you the possibility to customize the OS@@ D colors for font and background . a click on the color ground opens the dialog to color selection . if self @-@ color colors will not be activated , the aforementioned are used and KDE ; colors used .
the text display text displayed by the text in the OS@@ D text . by type of plac@@ ements , the OS@@ D can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space card and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ fold monitor environment should appear to the OS@@ D .
the card audio edition allows you to select an audio @-@ driver from the selection box . some drivers activate further options in this map card .
the map card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , browse the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to write a folder in the collection , select the tick@@ ing box next to his name . this section also contains an@@ gled fields to setup , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to music is well @-@ known .
monitor changes : enabled &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( such as music files are added or deleted ) . besides , a incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ad ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection adds . the automatically added playlist appear then later in the play@@ lists .
the part of the payment database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ feld driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further facilities are needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l institution .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l @-@ establishment is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ad ; under computer , the computer is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which is made to the connection .
use username and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the cart@@ on last@@ .@@ f@@ m depends on the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ad ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a bur@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece if necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here you enter your username and password for your bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
send Ab@@ split pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activating this setting is called &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be viewed in the context browser . note : you do not need bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b . Linux ) . you will find more information in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package of deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will set the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus working , but flu@@ x@@ box will help you difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a bug in the day@@ light library . you can watch the file by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this bug on the Tag@@ lip developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the cap@@ ut@@ te file that causes the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , this is that Tag@@ um cr@@ ashes when reading the meta @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature .
make sure that all libraries have been compiled by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if for instance &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then hit it into the editing of meta @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machines . shut down when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . when it is a cr@@ ashing cr@@ ashing and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 write to meta @-@ information , but they do not identify as Unicode . the Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random Mode / repetition / Dynam@@ ics playlist ) can be easily forgotten . this is a known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows their effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : in@@ active symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ error , then check whether Amar@@ o@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see ld@@ d &apos;E@@ me@@ gab@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify on the ligh@@ test by using a experts your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or among developers . they do not use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you &apos;re in the case of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music get there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intuitive to the surface , the start window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist the application list and select column . click somewhere in the new review column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist to remove from the list menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let them fall , just as you would do it with other files .
in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to the Add button , is located the button playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok . new . also take a look after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it using the menu bar under extras for equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is supporting G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in pre@@ setting no MP3 deco@@ ders ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 KDE , Rhin@@ et@@ aste
run the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be achieved through a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( such as SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem @-@ matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sc@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media is first de@@ codi@@ fied . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codi@@ le it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codi@@ fies the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be directly on AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with maximum possible priority ( real@@ time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the wr@@ apper are set su@@ c@@ ist :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . the enlarge des Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA layout file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE multimedia fully to get the faster Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized strongly for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less income will react to visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
g@@ Stre@@ ams is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . execute G@@ ST register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ o@@ ad before ! ) : - loading your ff@@ peg down , compile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report about it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ I . if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm carry out this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the reproduction start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have awakened by the soft killing of the music you have stopped in front of the bed .
how to get to know the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ters and titles of the current piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok Player of the Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + Rights mouse button provides a piece in the fix sequence into the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich features , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control Panel ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; to the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and on the console appear a lot of error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on audio CD with multiple folders . to the normal read , change in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . to automatic code you can instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can register your review for one piece by clicking on a column transfer in the play@@ lists . there you can select the assessment of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and Edit : review and edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the assessment in dialog &apos;s dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want to pre@@ fix you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not connected with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can find but quite annoying . disable the option icon in playing animated in the Universal Settings .

the sub @-@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be mounted before the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ) , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter sorted in the upper list of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you are finished , click App@@ ly . if the transmission is completed , finish &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the balance connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the web browser there is a address bar where you can grab music from a entered URL . if you have for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can grab music from there into the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attach@@ ments of the Shift key may be difficult . in this case , the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : thereby the deleted files will automatically be inserted at the end of the list and not on the Mau@@ le .
the playlist all sends you to the play@@ able pieces . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries simply using the mouse on the desired location . once you enter the letters , the letters will contain . to reset the letters , you press as long the back@@ ar , until the text box is again empty .
if you enter by spaces of separate search terms , the search is included . if you choose between one two three , the Search will find all the entries , one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , you are searching for entries , either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the blank spaces are included , then join the search term with go@@ ings : Mike Old@@ field . thus , following entries were included , which Mike Old@@ field is included , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you provide a specific search column , you can also search for larger or small . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which contains a particular phrase , make a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes for popularity with one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bath . this is looking for all the pieces that either do Mike vintage field , or higher rating than 50 have and not included the comment .
you can set the playback sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side you will find the Add button , with which you can add the playlist items . to the right there , you will find play@@ lists , play@@ lists , empty and over@@ due mixing .
next follow the buttons and restore res@@ ist . this allows you to make changes to the playlist or restore it .
in the middle of the toolbar you can find a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ ch@@ rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can view in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration set up .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example ren@@ dition and volume control . you can set the buttons set up by clicking on menu and set the toolbar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play of all pieces . in addition , the status of random Mode and the playing time of the current piece is indicated . the status of random Mode and Rest@@ ore can easily change by clicking with the mouse twice in the appropriate view area .
you can also hide the status bar also . disable the status of the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu is accessible by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in . there you can choose the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting its actions cover in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
with the View menu , you can select what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your large suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone ; the pieces will play : 1 will first play , 2 as a second , and so on .
the maintenance of the queue open you over extra maintenance queu@@ es . if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to establish these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . they do not need bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
simply click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then select it . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist , so under circumstances ! with the
the two pres@@ et modes of random mix and play@@ lists are instantly complete your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the play@@ lists will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece by yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the end of the first piece , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the button New fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open up to editing the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be passed over and they will be able to listen to this playlist , but if the setting is active , the pieces are already played in compliance with the pieces of playing songs .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to play@@ lists after each played piece . if you adjust here more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of dialog you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you add multiple play@@ lists , the play@@ lists is added from each of the play@@ lists play@@ lists .
some scripts allow our own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Settings .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts install by clicking on script . after you can install the script , a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Other scripts .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select this to delete the script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your scripts , please check the letter of scripts .
the dialog @-@ Window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used for activation of available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the tick@@ le to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create a audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps a audio CD , you need to have a hard @-@ run installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats , then remember that you &apos;re going to get rid of MP3 a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ sp@@ ect .
in this dialog window you can do nothing . please wait until the calculator has completed the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; one data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; have included the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for example , to create the different recording of music &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different acc@@ esses of the different albums are to be reproduced in different albums , that the music pieces will vary .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it includes the necessary software to run from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously used file is over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would then save for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project changes and is not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then set between save and alter@@ ing changes . also , you can shut down the cord and keep the project opened .
includes all open @-@ opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project , which is supposed to happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not saved project will be asked what to happen to , as if you had called the file .
if you access this entry , you can select the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristic dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only open when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described about the What is it ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ meeting CD . this is useful when this function is not used , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files and folders on the medium .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function aims to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature does not remove files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
you can also create a CD Copy dialog . alternatively , you can create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also just create a picture of a CD , which you can then burn sometime later . besides , there is also the possibility of cra@@ ving instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows copying DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create a picture of a DVD , which you can then burn sometime later . besides , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialog yet , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can form@@ atting a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the cursor over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file using a source of data , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the distill@@ ery . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as a source of data that can then be burned down by pressing the distill@@ ery .
a previously illuminated DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog will usually be used after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used all@@ ot@@ able . it contains information about the illuminated video , co@@ ding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed medium . this information is displayed in the table and include properties of the medium , such as size and titles of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is tick@@ ed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is scrat@@ ched , a small ca@@ ste at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information on the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not inter@@ sect , the status bar is hidden .
enables the folder view , or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , their content is displayed in the table View . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media Info , locking and fl@@ aming the running or outlet of the medium .
enables the table view , or out . the table view allows selecting and drag files into the project view . the table view is also the interface for reading audi@@ o- or video CDs , provided that a disk with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view was selected .
turns the head@@ bar in the project view , or out . the head@@ bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that is only visible when the proj@@ ections has open projects . the head@@ bar has no real function , it looks only pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to modify the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ ystro@@ kes to it below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; interior assist@@ ants . this allows the right permission to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights will need , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general arrangements . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should function on th@@ ief . this dialog is intended to person@@ alise and intended for fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; KDE ; applications equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped with the help of this interface can be controlled by means of functionality via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are essentially identical to your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the enclosed programs you give .
in this chapter we take note that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to be able to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , which have all &amp; KDE ; program measured , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts which are described below .
die Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
copy of the COP@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ .@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ ® ( ) void in copy@@ - C@@ d@@ d ( ) void at the form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) of the form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one receives a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then you receive a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to alter the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
near cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void void ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void with add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) at void ( Q@@ String Path ) void ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String ( name ) void ( Q@@ String id )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT C@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ able the fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT for / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ les@@ er for &amp; KDE ; and with it can be easily stored audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the machine .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that support these WAV files ( compressed free compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( compressed free compression ) are still being installed from the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ding can be added to the program ( if you have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD is read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( lost and compressed ) ; and then
are used in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG form@@ atted as well as in other formats such as lu@@ st@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has put together a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step you have to be installed ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions already , it &apos;s most likely to be necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions which are used . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word to copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copying audio CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ yp@@ ass the mechanism of copying . simply avoid the mechanisms of copying audio CD ; s !
while the setup is to be done once ( the furnishings dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB on the Internet or can work fully without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data according to the setting up of your request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , the latter case must first be connected to the internet . )
starts reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings in the plug @-@ in settings - encoding settings .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder than the default . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the tab code settings in the furnishings dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already illuminated file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and deco@@ ding .
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programmer ( such as read the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the dialog box dialog from &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . so , you have to go before the program can successfully be used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right co@@ war@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost is a lu@@ st@@ proof audio format needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can playback these files .
under the audio formats , the information caused by data compressed according to their psycho@@ analy@@ tic model , MP3 and O@@ GG , are the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distribu@@ tions free of charge but there are open license questions
+ high to very high quality high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , slightly deeper quality in deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a brief list with parameters to audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme @-@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 t@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older appliances need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable equipment and auto@@ cl@@ ere@@ als . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without consideration on the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are typ@@ ed manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the free@@ DB through the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used / paste with an audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programmes , there is often a combination of program for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders , explain the switches to these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ alz in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , where people can download the audio CD , the information go up or enter the computer . it is to note that here only by text is said : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ger : this is the author ) is not an attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; for more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist or the music @-@ company can be added any harm . all information can anyway be added at a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose an address ( send an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address than the specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used by the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if the audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB is to be used , the geographical line should be used on the next panel . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of reflection on the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually Monthly created ) just the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that it is c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia used ; who wants to know more precisely in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to be aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
to save the illuminated WAV files the encoding file can be selected and thus the desired file format is selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a lu@@ st@@ less comp@@ elling for audio data ) on the tab for setting the co@@ war@@ der . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ fier package needs to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ ding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Worldwide Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ fier , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a counter window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . thereby , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check out the setup of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copied audio CD ; check out the sle@@ eve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you put writing on it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done just once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the co@@ ding co@@ ding to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program with , the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not find them with every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual equipment designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only For incomplete information can be requested , so that you will be informed if information is missing to the witnesses of keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be connected to the computer while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk . the directory entry or fil@@ ename can be changed easily . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed by Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tag with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter everything manually , then de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use free@@ DB in the Off@@ line mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first one . the mode will be arranged on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server through the Internet . how do the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screen shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB servers : please go to F@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load between the computers is distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , since there are many fire@@ walls affect the protocol of 88@@ 80 standards , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first approach to disable should be determined .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot now . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously out@@ going pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply trying themselves .
record CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to read the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you are specified this indication , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this can not be useful if only space is created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything to enter as it is on the scre@@ enshot now . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be put right down to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : in a du@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to codi@@ fy more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB must be described . the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is still not included in free@@ DB , the screen photos show a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully passed from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually insert it from the internet . comments will refer to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD now needs to be defined in the main window , which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , just as in the scre@@ enshot now . this only when the &amp; CD was identified ; when audio CD was identified and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia could be read .
if this is not done , then you are looking for questions and answers for help or go back to the previous section of the basic settings .
warning : if the &amp; CD was successfully transferred from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already completed , and the name of the artist and album are shown .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which you think is best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have selected the junction for the automatic retri@@ eval of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this data from selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field of the &apos; Pres@@ ent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; actu@@ ality title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ qui@@ le per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you may not only begin with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; this option is set up on the tab code settings ; take a look at the tab code settings .
you can change the tag information of the files on any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the co@@ aster to obtain more information .
simply select an entry , which obviously matches the style of the read @-@ on CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the records for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered any title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB Explorer . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the item .
note that there is a check @-@ character before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure that all the pieces are selected , or click the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with orders and follow what is going .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen when you are trying to work with a co@@ aster which you have not installed yet . pieces which were not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . do you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . to read and code parallel . notice the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration adjustment to press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . at high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous reading and encoding ( however , two different pieces of pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ fier . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoding of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; today , within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S are talking to CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distribu@@ tions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; as audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE ; package is . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs when it works , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different other programs has many variations in settings . best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screens of different cards of cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first time st@@ acks of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this sort of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program backup no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; who can also do something useful or change , may it do . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has loaded this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange when you have succeeded is the source file from the &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N to pick , then you don &apos;t need this information but ...
&amp; mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ gam@@ er of &amp; KDE ; besides others he has with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ real high@@ lighting of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; KDE ; support . &amp; mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ sion@@ er project drivers , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; mid ; shows the lyrics text on the screen with changing color , making it simple to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can get in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can draw .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs or text events ) . K@@ mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
sitting support . if you finish &amp; KDE ; during playback of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open opening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song .
you can also make a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and bed the button to play in the toolbar , select the item you play from the menu or bet@@ s the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; mid ; one piece will automatically start when you move it to the &amp; mid @-@ mid @-@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; mid ; one piece plays off , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive over and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ indication , and change the playback speed . to get back the original pace , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar looks like a pressure on the kno@@ cking break or selecting the menu entry break in the menu pieces , thus , inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . I watch the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starting &amp; mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in a music piece . some pieces use Tex@@ ts , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; mid @-@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so that you have to set nothing manually . if you have to set the menu settings for Automatic text message . you still have the option to change this when you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a sequence of event , choose from the menu settings the entries text and property events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are the number to play . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , you first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then provide the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the missing pieces in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave this collection , this collection will not be stored . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding is enabled to collection , a piece of opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically Add to Collection is not enabled , opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ oval .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove or remove an accidental order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song play , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to move a song further , select the button next song , the item next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the item previous piece from the menu pieces or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection manager and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as they are saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that understands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which trans@@ forms all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS -@@ Cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text @-@ file that saves all required transformations for playback of a piece of piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence contains a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A new keyboard ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left @-@ hand side of the Equ@@ al sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM will appear in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board is not supported by a gun ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which include the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( tissues shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is placed in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , with which every sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the tone @-@ height of the same drum ( as it means some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to indicate how notes on a particular channel or instrument are shown .
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , and their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can set multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the per@@ k channel . see for example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , you can easily set it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are usable for key@@ boards , which have the percussion to a particular channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns :
n is the channel , which is pic@@ tured on the channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used to use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , that will change the patch on this channel . in this case a patch has become used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ k @-@ channel patch on the Per@@ k@@ way channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio will be multiplied , in which relation Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events are multiplied with the value n , it is activated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to be in the map file not dec@@ imal ( ) .
this setting is needed because GM prev@@ ails that a key@@ boards will play a sound higher with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; b .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cl@@ ots you see which notes are exactly played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer use the original instrument .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played notes . view the view menu settings below the point of channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece . it includes the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; mid ; that happens because &amp; mid ; without the A@@ we support was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can double the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double .
I have on a &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop space a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a MIDI file or I would like to play a file , just change the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file fast without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. only just want to play the first file . so make your setup automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly that a MIDI file .
then join in to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ate myself to program .
&amp; Di@@ mid , was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I &apos;m written in the third year , so I do not take much time for my hob@@ bies , but I am trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and prove it .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you truly make me a huge surprise when you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file . before you want to send a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I maybe have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t miss anything about it . I want to stress that I only get more programmable because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. sta@@ ler - rec@@ tification of the error that the pitch at A@@ we @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the A@@ we support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for the test of the A@@ we support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfe@@ ffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ mer , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error correction or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition to this one can also be found at its homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development and look for pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; b ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you &apos;d like to hear a sound@@ card , except that you cannot listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; T player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play Video Files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; KDE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the site The KDE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; user mailing list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called flo@@ wer@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is repeated in it .
it is possible to storing the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played according to each other , so you should use the category Dau@@ erh@@ aus playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hier@@ archi@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you anc@@ akes an entry , his group and all its sub@@ categories are copied to the current category and playback with the desired entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and thumb@@ nails can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if you click on a category of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , you can simply click on a name of a category button to choose from the menu View and next editing mode . due to the cli@@ pping of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu of the same with play@@ lists and either selected by the default mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the work@@ station will leave , or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on through changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to enable other animation to enable the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / play@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during stopping doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ ject &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ lets ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ds ; As a source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ Player .
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ player and the memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c@@ c , as the setup of the back@@ end per mim@@ ic ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is used :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within and k@@ m@@ player ; even the special field Emb@@ ed can be inserted for YouTube in the playlist XML .
thus the &amp; b player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can reproduce , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module serves as service providers for the MI@@ ME @-@ Type S / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishings dialog .
the Con@@ quer@@ or &amp; Restaurant ; is to browse in a consoles application and search for error regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
with this always a given back@@ end for a particular MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only once this was determined ) , this must be done by manual anxiety of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; T player ; can be used by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner is used to be used and the configuration file can be configured manually or the configuration file can be manually edited .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is detected in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected from which one selected co@@ ding must be found out ( e.g. , it PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR can use support from k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video ( probably this type of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one working ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functioning properly for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of formation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ our@@ ce , t@@ ros@@ our@@ ce , t@@ lad@@ our@@ ce , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist .
are there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is available as a user root after connecting the device . this is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slowly , why has to be tested my CPU to its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will x@@ ins the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user space and network support and becomes comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; required .
l@@ atex ; : a professional scroll application . among Unix @-@ like systems will probably be returned to the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation should be attracted to the distribution of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distribu@@ tions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the ki@@ le ; website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for the documentation must be considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact information should be made via the ki@@ le ; website .
if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if expan@@ sions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list box @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programmes . furthermore , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; may start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start there .
for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the correct place : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . W@@ Ã ¤ hr@@ ates the ur@@ king &amp; tex ; easy to use , can also use an av@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ . lay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; mac@@ ros is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
w@@ ander here only a good view to &amp; l@@ atex ; given is it not the ultimate book to you . to be correct , good B@@ Ã ¼ cher such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just as other manifestations , includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text messages , the node begins with the command \ \ Program { document } , and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a te@@ eter feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ s ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be applied to some of the related settings .
document classes : this is hereby the type of the document using : article ( items ) , book &#91; abstract &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ap@@ pr@@ t &#93; , films &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
co@@ ding : hereby the codi@@ fication of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list included the usually used additional packages for l@@ l@@ atex ; for incorpor@@ ation they can only be explored in the cross area .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the docum@@ ent@@ classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN requirements ) .
new users are now not worried about a brief description of the functions and further information .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors , the high@@ lighting of used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; it is very easy to remember that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is determined by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and while si@@ r@@ able .
with the automatic conversion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ v { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically create a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to the string of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the most common and sub@@ sist@@ ence the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the Stru@@ c@@ tural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse @-@ click on the device .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file has been created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF the current output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and to print DVI ; files for different systems and sizes .
when using the kitchen search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file with the Editor is hat@@ ched and once placed on an element in the DVI ; -@@ source code has been clicked on , becomes the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was clicked , becomes the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer ges@@ tions .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with others integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ making : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source text ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â , sel@@ ector , and it is not a call from &amp; oc@@ ular ; according to the rapid construction .
when considering the editing tool , the three rough fields are marked . the selection fields were designed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick struc@@ turing of the document in parts , sections , sections , ... The in@@ appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box prints are for example of articles such as keywords , fu@@ gue , notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command a name for a section is created , an image or different element is created .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary translations ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; b@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b bi@@ b@@ tex ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be found naturally also in &amp; ki@@ le ; written by hand .
the last sel@@ f@@ field with the name of gray is used for determining the font . it can be used to define the fonts for the main text , the joints , etc . , there are the following let@@ tering :
when calling for &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices for installation : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to the hand .
the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; establishes the fonts . the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code was typ@@ ed , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled . the simplest way to this is the use of the Men@@ s Building or the button of the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically saved .
sl@@ ats the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the logging in accordance with the errors . if use of quick @-@ construction should be started . if use of quick @-@ construction should be started . if this is not the case , should also be observed if the protocol should be observed .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document , for example , a report with the font should have a different writing . then the command \ \ begin { Environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { Environment } .
the inj@@ ections are only available within the area ( from \ \ words { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no let@@ tering ( number ) for ordering within an environment .
there are many possibilities to enligh@@ ten the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , li@@ abilities , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc . add these commands either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ ben@@ h { word } cur@@ sive .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : creates a quotation in the document . the quotation starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; label language was shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once in the wizard a bit text was typ@@ ed , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there should be min@@ d. a quotation , a few positions in the li@@ pos@@ h and course of course and a poem to apply to see the differences in these commands .
once the document was viewed , it can be returned to the editor using the editor @-@ view or C@@ trl ( in the internal observer ) . with an external viewer , the window has to be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is a linear file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ oses ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer are created . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer figur@@ ines .
for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document using a file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar light creates the transformation of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion into slightly different formats can start using the kno@@ bs in the toolbar .
the pre@@ pu@@ zz@@ iness search the direct jump from the editor to an associated position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; it offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . for this purpose , only Modern among settings Ki@@ le set up ... tools can be washed out .
to look for the prefer@@ ential search , the mouse pointer is positioned in a line of the source text and ended upon preliminary search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular , with a click of middle mouse button on the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; must be set in &amp; oc@@ ular ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as a text editor , are set ( settings oc@@ ular setup ... Editor )
should the turn of quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer not , can be a mistake . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window in summary .
the log file contains the error source in the source code . the log file always can be used between the errors . the log file appears on the line where the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , it must be clicked on the bug in the logging file and ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the corresponding button is clicked on the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the possibilities presented are :
in selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . for more information , this document is included in the section .
ugly users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be found in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file accessed , or create a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using the template to create an existing document and selection of file template from the document .
when creating a new document from a template using the new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or drawing ) . these variables can be set up in settings Ki@@ le setup ... settings General are set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ : this string is used by entering in documentation class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and that enables you to use the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can be chosen instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . becomes a simple way for creating a template , should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be found in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Tools right out of &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its features should be experienced the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can place there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called the Men@@ s help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it included a detailed description nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; usage can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with dr@@ unken Str@@ g button to w@@ ander the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way by clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ \ refer to only \ \ par excellence .
when pulling the text with the left mouse button , the text @-@ turned text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , you can choose parts of the source text in the editing pane .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the opportunity to browse the most varied types of source texts and to emphas@@ ise it . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands of normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants have a very own type of book@@ marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . this jumping brand is highlighted , so that it is also highlighted in the first input of a drawing .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; even though &amp; K@@ ate ; already outstanding features are added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source texts , always add many environments and groups and therefore support ; special commands for their selection . under Edi@@ tions are the following commands to choose from :
w@@ ells a complete paragraph ( group of lines that included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with all tables ( like in other text dit@@ ors ) . these advanced meaning close to tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source texts . the only negative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is thereby that the waste streams separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with an Ã ¼ rich star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for viewing a part of the document , of course , it is possible to pick out this first and by Dr@@ ying of the button . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the ke@@ yp@@ ad C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands , for a faster delivery . under editing are the following commands to read the text :
re@@ moves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of processing covers .
it has already clari@@ fies that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for further commands in the editing area for an extremely simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command it will move to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the command to serve the surrounding area .
this command will move towards the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the command to the rear of the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ &apos; command \ \ &apos; command } , it is placed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of wast@@ ed ambient commands can be quickly the while remaining . this command was close the most recently designed environment , so that the snow@@ ed ambient structure is not distor@@ ted .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands to suit those from their own .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly cl@@ amp cl@@ amp .
with this command it will move towards the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the cur@@ ly checked cl@@ amp .

with the input of many bol@@ ts @-@ br@@ ush@@ ed groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly get lost the time view . this command was close the last group , so that the sp@@ le@@ tel@@ te structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not distor@@ ted .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple attachment marks are used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple an@@ gling signs are used . and ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple lines . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two sleeping @-@ suited sign for &amp; l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic adjustment of the double attachment can be set under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be activated .
it can also be used to use specific settings ( such as German or French ) , and therefore German or French versions . there are also many other languages available .

although &amp; K@@ ate ; already provides a good source code , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually available for l@@ l@@ atex ; ) there are three according to demand and the other two are for automatic re@@ plac@@ eable . all these modes can be set up for different work@@ ings under settings Ki@@ le set up ...
starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when flying the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ down the last letter of the input is removed and allows you to extend the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be res@@ ized by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping brands are frozen , so that an easy jump to these positions by editing at the N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand can be found and the desired parameters can then be found .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; gener@@ ously can be made of settings to these lists . you can choose different wr@@ aps for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands as well as winding , are washed by the general language used .
the command mode is for the utilization of environments not weekly . it has always been typ@@ ed a few letters with \ \ &apos; begin typ@@ ing . on the other hand , the environments will often be used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the utilization of the environments to supply .
when calling for the full @-@ operation mode , the menu is automatically absorbed in the surrounding area or the keyboard short@@ cut of the environment and it appears \ \ begin } . after that , the ambient noise will continue in the simplest way and can be completed by the sending of the input key .
once this is accomplished , the surroundings will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a lists of environment , even a first \ \ item item is still covered .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; gener@@ ously can be done settings to these lists . this mode uses the w@@ allet list of the complete mode for e@@ tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of covers , which are immediately replaced by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ler strings . the lists can be found under settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ mi@@ xes , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word gla@@ zed mode used the men@@ ue C@@ trl + Alt whit@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
rough wa@@ its are not helpful for automatic gener@@ aliz@@ ations . however , it has been determined that many may be written in a document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the am@@ usement park is already written for everyone already written .

the dialog &apos;s graphics shows the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the basics to the graphic formats , the sections should be ignored and observed .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent base for browsing and ren@@ ces of pages . the PDF output will be created , so you can re@@ install the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools newly arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to be able to take care of the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed in the quantity to create comp@@ iling , creating transformations and creation .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewers such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or another conversion may be used by the keyboard , using the Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed by old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command &apos;s Quick Construction is normally a spect@@ ator called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used , any in@@ und@@ eser@@ ved viewer will be used every time a new window will be opened .
a new project will be asked about the project of New project .... the following information is asked for the project :

a fully complete refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and meanwhile , it is not just a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete manual for searching for a certain form of form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; it is not always easy to find the right document . as an excellent help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; the small application of texts , which includes a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; available documents and objects for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for parcel names or stroke . of &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; themselves , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . by doing so , the plugin system is very powerful . you can build from the additional functionality immediately and have to not wait until someone builds the sin@@ ful in &amp; qu@@ ake ; the plugins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below .
to install a plugin or a K@@ part , we start editing with the menu Plug @-@ ins . thus , the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog enables you to manage all the plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; - element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . if you use plug @-@ ins without a location , these path to search of the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on one project to each other in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ake ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the names and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of Team@@ members who he is . this is happening by calling the team member from the list , and the button set it as expresses . currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears , after which you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of your own identity are important to messages and notes . see for more information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
apart from the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that a file is backed by it , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that will add a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address selected in the recipients -@@ list selected address details . the addres@@ sat can be a team@@ - or sub @-@ project leader . see if such a head are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal reviews by the following things :
to enter any comments is simple . it can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by requests .
notes can be sent as a determin@@ ate member of the team . in this case , the name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the name of the presented nick@@ name of the team member state is to play a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project leader After the divisions and sub @-@ project names should be specified in the following examples .
nick@@ name and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ length , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ake ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings may be set up by means of configur@@ ing Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that will be treated to one another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; regarding tags , including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / small variation of tags : large / small variation of automatic tags . normal Groß / mini@@ ature means , the tags will be inserted as described in the following XML files .
large / small variation of attributes : large / small variation of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / small variation means that attributes are inserted as described in the following XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags except for simple tags .
start @-@ up and finish @-@ day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during entry .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ ics for detection of different types of files . using the Standard Standard , the standard orders can be recovered .
standard Dia code : encoding of newly created or used in another way than with file Open files ( where encoding of the file can be passed over ) . however , this setting is structured from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting is structured from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; creates regular backup copies so that in a black@@ out or cr@@ ashing when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for yet not stored documents will be created a backup regularly , according to the time being created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or a separate view ( or the documentation in a cardboard ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the default back next time is useful when the user interface came through changing the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views connected to each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ feed@@ backs serves the taxes of the possibility to re @-@ turn the display of warnings by att@@ aches of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structural @-@ tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , in detail .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ turing with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically when editing structures and how deep with a change of structural @-@ tree should be set automatically . blank knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which the current document has not found an element .
the section dedicated to the abbreviations ( one type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded by editing with extensive text . abbreviations are in groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means it can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plugins . plugins are k@@ part @-@ applications from third @-@ site which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , the most famous &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified following :
address : the path to the plugin when it is not in a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts does not refuse the store when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ake ; whether the entered information is correct . then select the storing of the entry , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it is to be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ake ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting was completely new . Di@@ e@@ support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations of plugins .
currently , only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ iring .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ antine ; -@@ UI :
a view in which the content of monitoring variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower Dock .
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this action the connection with de@@ bu@@ gger is required , if necessary , or it shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the leaves to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger version .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently out line @-@ out line . if this happens , the execution is continued . it happens before a debit card is started , the script will start with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script is attached , the execution is running . it happens before a debit request begins , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script without stepping into the functions or in@@ clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script when possible in functions and In@@ clu@@ des in error .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the instruction and to proceed to the next one , as if there wasn &apos;t the current .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , the monitored value will appear in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or given a new value of a variable .

documentation Edi@@ ting Edi@@ tors ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults ; to give support for mark@@ ers and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as CSS ; for your simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; qu@@ ake ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ ging toolbar ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ pieces . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the self @-@ text dialog ; for the day shows . the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even the toolbar allow for a quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without a risk of writing .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the let@@ tering language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ us )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and de@@ kl@@ ash whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to allow other users to gain a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders is set forth in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type about yourself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when used is used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ ane is valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a co @-@ attribute and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag is determined . this is a mere element type element .
describes a attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for any attribute . additionally it contains the name and type of attributes . additionally it contains other tags , which should describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only one element item .
returns the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor @-@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an intersection and a method name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container day group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute . it is a only one @-@ element element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog box . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
prints a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is an only element type .
prints a list of elements that end one day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
whit@@ esp@@ ace influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; toolbar ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not cause a leg @-@ off , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to re@@ viewing the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is open up in the &amp; qu@@ ake ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is not yet available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this meeting file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this meeting file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be reached via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set up with settings can be created ... click New action leads to the same dialogue :
this action attributed to this action can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut . it can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removable .
the simplest actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ained settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but on it it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or part of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; themselves are the quick@@ start dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled trails are allowed to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh @-@ scrip@@ ting folders : $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
% P@@ ID : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ake ; only an instance is running , the text is attached to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to the control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods there can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; on the standard input . in the selection panel you can be determined what is to send to standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % of the variable is usually reasonable only with this setting .
according to input , the output of the exec@@ uting application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , which is written on the default error messages . it can be specified , which should be written on the default version written by which the text box is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in a given case it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market .
once a work@@ load is added , you need to add and configure your actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add them to the toolbar .
complete everything and if the tag attributes , and you plan their use , activate a dialog &quot; day process , &quot; when available to enter the action is possible .
Ig@@ ing ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a start@@ button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start tag in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol , it must still be associated with action . this happens through the menu with settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with the OK button .
press the use button and continue using other tags , so there are or confirm with the OK button to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ings ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared with a better overview by some Tren@@ ner into multiple groups . make sure to set the toolbar on settings toolbar . make sure that the toolbar desired is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( completely left above ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
I like for example a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note , as the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my work toolbar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ but@@ ton@@ es be .
the new toolbar must be tested through testing of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ bal folders , but your work@@ pieces should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar can be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the mention value of &amp; qu@@ ake ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting address you like most . therefore , this chapter discusses how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be in &amp; squee@@ zed ; check out if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search a existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will leave you , the second , we treat you here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir . section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ ure@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ ure@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ ure@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = func@@ 1.@@ html pages 2 = func@@ tionally tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html Day 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like that :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # on Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess boards ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
you notice that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of the front view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; Resour@@ ce files are replaced .
the content @-@ section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended to display the context @-@ text sensitive support . for example , when writing a function name and D@@ ining of C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of con@@ co@@ ded text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure this good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ake ; -@@ communion . you will not become rich , but proud to have worked on the best we@@ aving platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ake ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ators ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ pieces with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . to make use of an easy contribution , what it guarantees a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
while up@@ loading you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can have a look . in the dialog New resource you have to stay out ( URL Preview can remain empty ) and then hit the high load of the high load .
the up@@ loading can upload of the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installing , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; the integrity of the resource by verification of integrity and signature . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . the creation may be prompt , because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in day @-@ to @-@ day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D load and converting a D@@ T@@ D . choose the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string that appear in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / EN HTTP / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / proj@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; squee@@ zed ; after conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; squee@@ zed ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and make full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults , one has to first become familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ings ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ake ; the employment area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ons ; uses , available . from work@@ pieces about actions is everything that is marked as globally , in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults ; it enables the group of administrators from different work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree to be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user index , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to work@@ pieces with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ö@@ g@@ licht .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the building control , the man@@ oeu@@ vre with information and the toolbar . please refer to and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab@@ s with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document messages , re @-@ load , deleted or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing the cursor on the mouse , help to the word under the pointer of mouse or opening the file when the string are referred to a file under the pointer of mouse .
at the top end of the editor there are the work@@ pieces of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of work@@ pieces will be shown . as part of the further expansion of work@@ pieces , the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in her document , then click on the icon that has represented the day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day ( such as Anchor ) , you can paste into a dialog different fields .
the constructions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ake ; to navigate , they open and ro@@ aming . in the display with cart@@ es stand for files , project , sample structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation components are available .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ake ; provides . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by means of right mouse @-@ click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading , or deletion of files from storage media can be performed with the context menu shown below .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ake ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . the right mouse button are available for example , such as the script to boot , edit or send by email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element , it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other components . with it can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this applies to the contents of the contract and allows modification of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . you can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults ; from the qu@@ ake ; &apos; docum@@ ent@@ ations site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , using the beneficial information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the follow @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts that will be executed , give all the error messages ( so there are those ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; work@@ pieces are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ates of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a toolbar in an email , they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults : like any other , backup and recharge !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and are not executed here .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ults , you should check if your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in PA@@ TH in front of their bin folder . the same holds for &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; squee@@ zed ; is a web development tool for the KDE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers began to deal with an obvious idea , what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him absolutely great@@ est web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done .
no longer on re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ie ; now it is far on its way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ake ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; KDE ; Develop@@ ers community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Sc@@ aff@@ olds is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ake ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and toolbar , automation is almost every task possible . by the program Com@@ bo , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . ( read more about it here . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast Web@@ design and has quickly expanded to an mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more to the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ desk help : / qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ hand list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template , will only be an error .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the clip@@ board there provided special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ notation , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ notation which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
select the block@@ ers in or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a number number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions in order to help you .
displays the message window to or not to . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of script and de@@ bu@@ gger .
initial and intim@@ id@@ ation of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structural base .
displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ mark from other opened documents will appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects are stored with the file name .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searched the project directory after new files that could be there . it enables e.g. to copy graphics files into your project level or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects can be explained to the details .
it loads a toolbar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates just the name . actions must save actions by means of settings can be saved . work@@ pieces will be saved via the toolbar and you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar .
removed a toolbar from the field of view . that does not del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; team so that the toolbar can be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message using the toolbar .
enables the high load of work@@ pieces on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; own description format .
loading / refresh of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is sensible if the entities should be out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a typ@@ ing in the global KDE folder does not exist , the shop fails .
this menu includes a list of tags , which are available in the currently uploaded work@@ pieces . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar can be loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ake ; the inser@@ tion by means of a toolbar , when this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed under the listed menu items . click on them . click on a activated plugin de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ dro@@ pping mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version AB .

checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of interface . by some limitations in KDE libraries can cause the switching sometimes time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the cart@@ ographic mode , which is also the default mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; 3.2 and sooner .
additionally this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window at or off .

complies with the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialogue will appear where you can delete entries from the toolbar or change them and follow the sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should create assistance in accordance with the environment of the mouse button , but it is not yet implemented .
&amp; squee@@ zed ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom , since for example after receiving the project name the whole directory structure will be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later on Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are set .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ake ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access one , except to edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets you empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer you might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ aving you want to download and change . if you add @-@ to script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
accused , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should not be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is begun to start anew , not an@@ hook .
with this option , all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of vou@@ chers .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick , pe@@ gs from the project .
the last screen of the new Project Assistant includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in menu with project properties in the menu window or to be modified using the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the extra entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( Plac@@ eholder can be ignored ) which will re@@ read about project @-@ related operations such as proj@@ ections .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about Project perspectives .
the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . at present , only Gub@@ ed can be supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case the troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building management for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ Window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the bottom window configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions when a previous event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see into the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ake ; the last project that was open . this behavior can not currently affect .
to open another project , select the project ... from the menu project or icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects will have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ake ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed .
folders behave as well , but missing the entries will be opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here can be selected different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile exists , the button will dis@@ end to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the kernel storage and for appointments . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather uncertain password on the plate is not coming into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; many skyscrapers are created and thus can be uploaded to different servers , editing the project ( or part of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server name to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is saved on the disk so that it can not be easily read , but each with programming changes it can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and work@@ pieces . it can be loaded in a project a lot of views , i.e. through simple sc@@ anners the view can be loaded various files and toolbar and replace the currently opened files and toolbar .
views can be stored or deleted in the menu on the project or the project workshop , can be opened or deleted from the toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ake ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ake ; to their own working practices .
as already mentioned above are work@@ pieces in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . best above the menu toolbar . use and adding are distingu@@ ish@@ able . the adding of work@@ pieces will be treated at the bottom in the adding of work@@ pieces .
the toolbar and symbols can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which with New action , a new toolbar can be executed , as stated in dialogue , where actions can be seen on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and the action will be displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings toolbar ... and settings promotions are set .
templates are essentially documentation , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files for the link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses ; used templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with expanded organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any place to the system existing directory in the template . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; in about the limitations one can imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ake ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of any template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pad@@ lock under global templates . more information on the Templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders . usually , some examples can be found in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text range always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summarized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
design a documentation structure according to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template , save as a local template ....
once that has come to happen , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . check out the cau@@ tious tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template to save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn up with drag and attach to the modular @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only available in an integer folder . it can be used for all file management functions so as to drag and insert or paste via the file tree of Con@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on the file tree or in the project files building to create a folder on the right and backup website template , but by default , it can be saved in the project level , but of course it can be used as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can design head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , inser@@ ting files or connect them with them . additionally , you can keep some things in touch with templates in projects very profound .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@
to set the behavior of a folder in the preview overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ usive as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes is ins@@ ulated .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the regular folders in the prepar@@ atory overview . if a regular folder is set off , it would appear specially activated in this path . in case of normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ building . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allowed a detailed or written text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er lines for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers , a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Editor @-@ Editor , which covers the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the Zwe@@ ite shares the Editor window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor where the changes made in V@@ PL ; Editor in source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this direct with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor to edit it is still the source code editor necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor synchron@@ ous is already active , this mode is already active , puts the key pressure from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the sync distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchronization according to a click or automatically select . by selecting automatically the time span can be set . basically , the recommendation is : a small sp@@ anne for quick calcul@@ ators and a large sp@@ anne for slow @-@ slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing features is possible to choose , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be created . this serves the reduction of the suspension code . this allows you to change the following :
meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords available for internet search engines . meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete it . a change over the list is exactly as with the meta @-@ elements possible . editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not yet supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style system by pressing the file @-@ button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by plant@@ ing with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and by typ@@ ing or removal .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source code editor , made . it is to be observed that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag will be inserted with text , every other round anchor must be removed .
some work@@ pieces like the tables or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of work@@ pieces must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of styl@@ istic periods . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ ling templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ ling can be prosec@@ uted .
to be &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; compile successfully , need except &amp; KDE ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; KDE ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a file name without p@@ adding . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most charged sty@@ ling fil@@ ename with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is available for example a sty@@ ling file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ ME or a given mod@@ ulation name checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP ME , which contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be presented according to the rules that is defined by the name specified in the X@@ SL source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 will be added . extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a pur@@ ge shelf must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ en@@ number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re@@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only from the ASCII characters 0@@ x@@ 00 to 0@@ x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name such as &quot; X@@ SL : templ@@ ate@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local fil@@ ename on the system of use . on uni@@ x or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as short @-@ form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems are also allowed more environmental variables .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the interplay was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had changed many changes and at the same time had been corrected with many places in the same file . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in bringing together .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the f@@ laws had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; there could be differences in one row and changes to white signs . later , a lot of more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text for example , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ isons window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function changed &amp; diff@@ use ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 ways con@@ veying is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot show three qu@@ ell files in the merge :
&amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this screen shot shows &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; in the folder merging :
&amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve them in the possibilities of heu@@ b@@ ish hu@@ ore . if you need to check co@@ de often , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no hassle , if someone and the op@@ ulation changes . )
when a file is the same , and the other differs in a line then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the Ti@@ p@@ at work by completely copy the fil@@ ename of the first file completely . for example :
De@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder D@@ zi@@ ner@@ .@@ Fol@@ der 2 folder De@@ diff@@ 3 folder D@@ folder 2 folder D@@ folder 2 folder D@@ folder 2 folder and folder 2 folder
the opening @-@ dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ ename , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list box . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you have to empty the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the con@@ ical or merging of folders will be introduced . however , if for A file is selected , for B and C a folder then uses &amp; diff@@ use ; the fil@@ ename from A in the other folders .
when merge is active , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can get this step later on when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the compar@@ isons .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialog you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel &apos; button .
you can also drag and drop it : drag one file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
which thought is it ? sometimes , a file contains such a number of similar functions . if you like to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to load only two corresponding files to simply copy them in &amp; diff@@ use . now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply copy , and then compare .
note : right now you can choose nothing from &amp; diff@@ use ; only the case run by text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and insert text into another program as excer@@ pts and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window the info section of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each pointer has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while over the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these curtains can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees on the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is different for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is easy to see in the next section ( merger ) .
links next to the text is the summar@@ ised column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and reviews , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare items . )
the vertical line which separates the summar@@ izing column from the text is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines , the line is pic@@ tured on broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has a info line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it contains the automatic merge already text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the saving is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the most severe / ung@@ ed conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference simultaneously has to be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line belonging group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . ( this will also be visible the current group . ) This group will then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each appears on the left a black beam .
sometimes , through automatic merge or by manual editing no more line is left in the group ; then this text is displayed in the qu@@ el@@ ds ; it &apos;s only a space @-@ card for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ izing ; however , appears in the clip@@ board ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function around .
note : if when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating is mainly used with the mouse @-@ run and the mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ flow column next to the vertical scroll bar can also be used to Navig@@ ate into the Navig@@ ate .
in the Au@@ for@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ hau@@ l mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ize columns in view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as already in the section summar@@ ised and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap ) to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap ) or to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , must be regarded as conflict between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the markings into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl + insert ) . however , this option will automatically copy you automatically into the clip@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be with this option but careful , because you might be able to over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line @-@ in sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use tow@@ ing + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 retains the transmission of source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of files recently used will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu In@@ stell@@ ations@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also displays writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are shown in recur@@ sive font . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing does not happen .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be l@@ ast@@ ed . on these systems the button preferences automatically displays an odd color .
if this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ s button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
if you press or return return , the em@@ itting of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual is copied into the clip@@ board then .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system .
at the same of files tries &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first , all completely identical lines to be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is not ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also , while inter@@ ing , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car kno@@ bs &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others are simply ignored and diff@@ use . if this option is enabled , it will be treated differently . if this option is activated , it will be de@@ activated with different sizes on the side @-@ on page , but as a white sign be treated . during the crash , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this is disabled .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis the figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
the default option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
the auto @-@ shift mode determines this setting , as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
elimin@@ ates automatically all conflicts in white signs using the selected file being used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . please note that the automatic selection can also be trac@@ ed in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and transmis@@ sions . check for details under documentation to directory comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g is attached . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without any further backup .
fits the language of the interface . changing this option affects not the currently running program . you need to finish line diff@@ use . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; Mar@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is employed globally on the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it is used for all entries the upper setting .
over the selection areas for co@@ ding appears a quick note that is the local encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . )
customize the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting interpre@@ ting for each file individually , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which co@@ ding should be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they could possibly not function with your co@@ de@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output of previous processing command .
turn off this to supp@@ ress of changes in white characters in the text or viewing column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . however , sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . depending on selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ ds ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ flow column with the information you need .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important windows . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the compar@@ isons side by side or to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts to merge the merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ assembled name for output file . ( if this function is used to launch the merge again , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file it will first pass on to this external command . in &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut down parts or to correct the rec@@ ess .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the tick . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to enable the user to give more flexibility in setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program this . the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this pre @-@ processing command for tw@@ addle to transform the input into big letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 2 / &apos; . the \ \ 1 in the exec@@ utable string refers to the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . the \ \ U turns the found text into big letters .
using CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert character chains ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _ URL \ \ _ BA@@ R _
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might recognize these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ ses . sed &apos; / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions up once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions .
instead , you can also use something different like Z. B. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / counter &apos; aller@@ gen are in per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) need per@@ l only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data after normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and assemb@@ ling . further operations change only the data , which of the line @-@ h@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m can be seen .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line processor has seen the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit multiple files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; diff@@ use ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes for each object a suggestion to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting
... can sim@@ ulate the merging and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without being able to perform
... introduces selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and con@@ veying of individual files . you only need to open a folder on the command line or the dialog .
if three files are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start the merging . to launch the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow ) .
while reading the folder you will be informed a little message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that date .
when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can double clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories cr@@ aps and all sub@@ directories cr@@ aps up with which you can use all folders and folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will start immediately and it appears as a comparative window .
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ led window to the selected object . in such a case , the assemb@@ ler action can not be automatically chosen . if the merging is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , you will be used in the columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then also folder are the same color . in folders the age is im@@ material for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf back , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( such as A folder and B a file ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , the merging can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( such as A folder and B a file ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , the merging can not be started .
the mode to sync is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised , then select &amp; diff@@ use ; the necessary action to look after both files are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after the con@@ duction copied &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be merged and select the option of new file instead of merging ( uns@@ afe ) , then examine an error message : files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not removed , the merging of the folder can not be started .
during the crash , one file is processed after the other . you status column shows skills when the con@@ veying was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something un@@ expect@@ edly entered , you should make a last check and check if the status is all right .
if in the furnishings dialog the file comparative method is selected , will display the number of form@@ work , deleted , not wh@@ iter and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all together @-@ up actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified any destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder crash mode , B can be used as a target and used to synchronize A and / or B as the destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries may be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to merge all entries , select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only execute the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements appear . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options flow , sim@@ ulate and break down .
select sim@@ ulate if you want to see what will happen without which really changes will be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again directories and continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , an appropriate dialogue will appear . then results and diff@@ use 3 ; his work with the next record continues .
if &amp; diff@@ use , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will find some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem ( F@@ 7 key ) , allows you to try to select the cause of the problem ( F@@ 7 button ) , allows you to select the problem again or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the collapse .
if a number of entries have been individually merged , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be together again . even if the merger has been transferred or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the merger action , these entries will be re @-@ merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory contrac@@ tion with these options :
only files that fit on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element @-@ tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file must not match this pattern .
files and folders match this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders match this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a single attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems marked a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
with links to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that a link to a folder of a link can lead to a loop loop and &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched on in default .
exec@@ uting a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics column . ( the number of Del@@ ete , Com@@ for@@ ter and white conflicts . ) The whole analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when used on files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed costs will cost you a certain level of safety . please use caution . this option is connected with caution .
similarly as familiar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful for example if when copying the change of time . please use caution . this option is in default .
activ@@ ates the sync mode if two files are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals to merge together are identical . also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of the merging the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it &apos;s the knowledge that the other file has not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched on in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and gets deleted . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of files , not just the merging of entire files . this option is enabled in default .
usually , the directory assemb@@ ler view can be visible to the merging of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views through the window &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also run a single file directly from the merging menu . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be merged once you start the folder together .
this status will however be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ UP 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive containing a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relative . or .. included . that is with URLs not possible , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ onry . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays . then always a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change of change from the original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose @-@ purpose is currently as differences of spect@@ ator in por@@ de@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op initially starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start the mouse button , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part , from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; diff@@ use ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a c@@ unt , the input file holds a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then det@@ ects &amp; diff@@ use ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start @-@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will recover the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the patch file .
if it is executed as a part , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the merging or the comparing of folders will not support in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist &apos;s comp@@ are ) are already available . moreover , the name K@@ diffusion 3 already indicates that it can lead together as the program diff@@ use from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to be so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script probably not the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is treated differently , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this do@@ is , but this is the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost when the result is stored easily as a text file and it &apos;s much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was too large . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to elaborate preference . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ us@@ ingly and mis@@ ses the purpose . do not use any other editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of it , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; De@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ bahn and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut off ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies the marked text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current market .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders and appear not in the folder structure , and consequently do not appear in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re@@ read changes to these options to the folder with the function Update . )
it will only show records that have differences . that also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder of these files does not already contain , they are missing in a later program version likely to change . ) This option is switched on in a later program version .
note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in result window ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button respectively .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . underground differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nails of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the field of work , to change their size , to quit them or to post@@ p@@ one it . this works both within a work@@ space and several .
the &amp; p@@ ager ; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications on display . applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and elsewhere .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other areas of work .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; cas@@ h@@ ager , the context menu has just been clicked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu is clicked on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and respon@@ ds . commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
send the application to select virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
if this approach is marked , you can switch windows inside the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces are moved .
if this field is scrat@@ ched , the name of the virtual desktop is displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces show ; it is together with name displayed , the names are equipped with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ Pay , &amp; eg . 1 . working space .
when this field is inter@@ sect , the background of each work@@ space is also displayed as background in the &amp; p@@ ager .
when this field is inter@@ sect , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to allow their selection .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager will be determined : classic leaves and k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n cr@@ ater appear , as made out of P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ man@@ es ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular in a vertical row , which is very suitable for the presentation lateral on the desktop .
the &amp; Plus ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their content can be displayed and moved . furthermore , it works outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button inside of &amp; p@@ ager ; and following setting the switch set up ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment it is not possible to change the dialog &apos;s settings , but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VII . if you do not have a typ@@ ed to the file , you must log in as a user root or register to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and assign values to this . possible values are :
da &amp; p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functional installation of the KDE discs package .

&amp; b like ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use with &amp; b ; a portion of the screen size , so you would like to read a magni@@ fying glass for the small printed or the precise watching of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; herbs .
&amp; As is a very powerful application that is continuously expanded by new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ yiel@@ ding machines .
if you want to boot , a window appears as above . the main window of screen . in the following this window will display as a magni@@ fying window .. the image that displays in the enlarge window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , I like to magni@@ fy the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable barrier . alternatively , you can see a selected screen area in the enlarge window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the setting of mouse @-@ cursor over . please note that this is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse button . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selective mode , you can adjust the selection window to your individual needs . you can move it to the arrow keys and mo@@ ods and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlargement window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the content of the enlarge window and move it into the arrow keys .
if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window to be postponed .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . please note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains firm and can only move the lower right corner .
&amp; c@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , paste into a file , turn into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image is turning and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . update the update brings that the required CPU time is up to 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very low , low , means , high , high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; glue ; used automatically your inserted short command to save files , opening a new window , prints , new@@ ads ( with the button document again loading in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and Ver@@ m@@ ans &amp; etc .
k@@ likes also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a screen of the screen so you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of use : from research on paper or artists to Web@@ designer or visually imp@@ eded .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL in the address bar by &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ help@@ desk help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor has been har@@ med for a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse @-@ click pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is har@@ med for a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who are suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . however , it may require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; may handle the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the mere conception of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that can be caused by typ@@ ing the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can affect anyone differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse @-@ click when you break the movement shortly .
if the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause , after it &apos;s the move of mouse button . move the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button will run . this way you can push the drag and drop a little practice , but you get used quickly it quickly .
this devast@@ ation period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse @-@ click leads .
is smart reloc@@ ating switched on , the filming of shooting ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here is the time set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if in the meantime no limitations takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow return to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; KDE ; to do this move the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the times .
if this setting is marked , the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; with every start of &amp; KDE ; started . this feature is currently only available under &amp; KDE ; available on G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all the settings back on the values that have been configured when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button , the settings will be applied to the stand after the last stop of the dialog .
the best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . in particular the intelligent duplication , you should first be switched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click to get used later you can get the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; KDE ; at sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows , or on places in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to un@@ aware reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ ined , you should clean@@ se your mouse . that &apos;s usually rather simple . the trick is that you can not only clean@@ se the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as that happens , from mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scr@@ ap@@ ed with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an accident resulting in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is that the operation can no longer stop by the slogan of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse @-@ click . thus , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will perform , and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor on the cursor , where you want to place it . however , you can give your mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you &apos;re feeling a ke@@ ystro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ repeat@@ able reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ used ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it back into the clip@@ board or execute any other action you want to move the mouse on pressing mouse button . here are some advice on this :
if you do not use the intelligent duplication , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select Text instead holding a mouse button down and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and move the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this becomes every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the smart@@ ly moving the shoot is beginning . later , you can use the intelligent duplication even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use that the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed . this should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and these are furnished correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ rot@@ ates the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor shortly . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and which the bed of the mo@@ tive pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain period of time waiting that a pulling action begins , before the mouse button is left . in this way can also drag the drag and place with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the bl@@ unt users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the talk of propositions which should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left scre@@ enshot ) you enter the command that will be used later for the language version of the text . further details can be found in the description of the layout .
on the second page you can choose the standard text@@ book . from the text@@ book @-@ book you can often select the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right side scre@@ enshot ) you define the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can assign the wording associated with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are absorbed into the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ ke of your propositions ( the lower white section in the scre@@ enshot ) and a shut@@ down of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white panel in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; properly setup , you can enter in the input field the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the memory . you can select from these propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu @-@ associated settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setting dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; for this dialog contains two card@@ boards , voice and settings , the site tri@@ ter@@ ium as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD .
in the input field of the cart@@ on voice , give the command to call for voice generator . in the selection panel below the input field you place the sign code , with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the tick@@ le if the text should be shared as standard input to the language generator .
if the tick@@ le is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following locations :
of course , the command to voice is dependent on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples for this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
using the kt@@ ts@@ d as language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; KDE ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for voice reproduction and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu of the text@@ book book or in the box for text text@@ books .
with the choice of instant you will be talked to the selected text passage directly and additionally inserted into the storage memory . with the selection of in the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field .
with the second selection box Close of the editing window for text @-@ car book , you can specify if the text@@ book book should be automatically saved in the closing of the editing window .
when you save changes , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . select Out@@ look@@ up , will be saved , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ ium page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose to choose the dictionary to be used dictionary .
with the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries or to export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read then the &amp; KDE ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply identified by means of appearance . in addition , you can compare the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; queries then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how this can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words automatically entered into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout time .
the main section of the window for the processing of text @-@ pass books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text@@ book books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books you can either get on the selection in the menu bar , on the toolbar or via a list menu .
the order of text messages or text passages can be changed by drag the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; old ; button .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer @-@ store .
the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer store .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the con@@ ges@@ tion .
if this menu entry is scrat@@ ched , a sliding toolbar with buttons is shown for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be arranged directly by default via the editing pane . by mouse @-@ clicking on the clever left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is scrat@@ ched , a narrow body is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not dis@@ sect , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is refer@@ enced , a postpon@@ able bust is displayed for text @-@ car books with entries . by mouse @-@ clicking on the clever left side and dial , the toolbar can be moved to another point by default .
probably you have the command for voice reproduction not properly or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for language version on the cart@@ on voice . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language version of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch is supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge and to distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for voice default , is believed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an English language generator . currently he supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language version , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language is then possible with one of the three following instruction examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ep@@ ic file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of charge for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / Car fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option data will be switched on as standard input .
the voice of voice D@@ äm@@ on von &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further language service , which is available to everyone &amp; KDE ; applications has a standard interface for voice reproduction . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice input systems .
since setting the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; mouth ; adjust .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language , which appears in the dialog dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak to display text by your computer . it is saved a list of already sc@@ aled sentences , which the user can always return again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . a so furnished combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , volume , and speed is referred to as speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
different spokes@@ person for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .

filter for string replacement provide a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong , or er@@ ased out @-@ spoken messages , is a good example . you removed the Tags b@@ r and b out of the news , the e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filtering , text appears before he is sent to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language to select wrong words or abbreviations , or to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working practices of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs from four types of texts .
the output of screen checks has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps those orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the aforementioned orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
News have the highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you can read a long text on a website , you can enter with &amp; mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; KDE ; messages are also news .
the rest are simple text entries . each job you encounter from the card ticket orders is a text contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text entries . text files are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen revisions . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will be stopped and terminated .
first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen playback . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; KDE ; News .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
Schem@@ ket@@ ten@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the plac@@ eable parts can provide you either as words or as a regular expressions , which enable the setting of chat @-@ moti@@ fs such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; form@@ ers use a X@@ S@@ LT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ S@@ LT @-@ files are included for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker adap@@ ters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have sent a female voice on the map card , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters has sel@@ ectable rules , after which he is applied to a voice default . if the filter does not indicate that his rules cannot apply , the text gives the text to the next filter .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; al@@ erts on &amp; kt@@ ts ; be sent , it is processed by all the activated filters made on the page below . the processing by the filters are processed in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not sc@@ aled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed the row from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the following layout dialog .
for setting up strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern . those patterns in the text are found , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding sub@@ code . large and small @-@ case is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filters . this name can be chosen arbitr@@ arily , he only needs to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column accordance and replace it in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regul@@ ars from a file that save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only used when the speaker refers to the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click with the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , mail
the application id running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers , you have to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only be copied .
the string composition filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the cast@@ ed filter are applied if the filters are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the string regul@@ arity measure regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by partitions ( space ) both .
in this hand@@ book you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions are available in the package .
&amp; XML ; form@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . it can be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable PA@@ TH , is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker option filter , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is arranged on the cart@@ on speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that texts by mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed on the filters , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is presented by the speaker &apos;s characteristics which the program pre@@ dict@@ ates the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent the speaker &apos;s properties on the card speaker . with the speaker option , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the exec@@ uting regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular Pay@@ ments installed , you can call this with one click on the button to receive help in input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DA@@ TA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of the requested speaker firm . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog language selection .
use this buttons to save or load your intercom settings or delete all settings .
the intercom filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ ese filter is applied if you need to apply at least one condition .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . take a look at the web page of kt@@ ts ; for information , which are not yet included in this hand@@ book .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adaptable module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not strictly necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment from KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages , and the development files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source archive or downloaded for each night currently er@@ un@@ ball , translate , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first whether spec@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . then you can use the shell script with SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is the first version of Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . the program t@@ tm@@ s@@ g@@ r should be developed so further that the establishment of Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher is directly accessible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user can res@@ ign or dis@@ miss the output , stop or cancel the output .
if an application text is written on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request the attributes of the preferred speaker for output . if you have chosen a spokes@@ man whose language English and whose sex is feminine , it will be automatically chosen by the most suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , one speaker cho@@ oses , see you in .
if you click on the cart@@ on speaker click , and therefore click on an speaker to the list or click Edit , the map card speaker display is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable time of the festival . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the codi@@ fication for text that is handed over to festival . in voices that is handed over to festival . generally , this setting is automatically made . generally , the Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used to use foreign languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you provide volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of synthetic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and displayed this grey , the voice chosen by you will not choose these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded because of their size several seconds to load . if you mark this approach , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( for larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this approach is not selected , you do not have to set up any speaker ( or forget to click on it ) .
if this approach is marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ sm@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r appears in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this gives you the possibility to read and to control it .
here are all orders in queue , together with the application that has submitted the job , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select sat@@ t in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also taken on the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead , AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here are only text entries listed and managed . expenditure of screen rec@@ orders , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it is compiled and kt@@ ts ; either with support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries cannot load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to have at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected here , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the inter@@ phone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equivalent to roughly half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal inter@@ phone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click on using the new settings for running &amp; work@@ ts ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt you choose default .
on this map , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language entries :
the output of screen checks has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps those orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the aforementioned orders will be picked up again .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; win ; processor will be hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone will welcome you to the room .
will a text order be interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio to the queue .
this audio file is always played , if a normal text contract is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map card apply only for normal text assignments . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ tification messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and click al@@ erts . the map card noti@@ fications appears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select this approach to turn the pre @-@ reading of &amp; KDE ; disadvantage : this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and kt@@ ori@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts are played by which a sound is canc@@ eled , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use this buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog will appear where you want to select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you chose the defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following locations :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speakers . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the cart@@ on speaker as a top listing . see also this .
note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is defined for events . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last possibility , the action has been set for wearing , which was specified under default ( all other events ) .
the event Display all notices for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the noti@@ fications below as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . the downloaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except All entries will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a voice copy . this standard contains trademarks for control of voices , speech speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation from for example abbreviations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default I agree to use the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML @-@ text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds may begin to be syn@@ thes@@ ized by text , not the whole text contract . in this way , you can also go back on the map ticket orders sat@@ a or withdraw , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support it directly .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as an ordin@@ ance of the form of proposition . you can change its settings , or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but it will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn how to try out the speaker selection . turn on the card down , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose some of the attributes and check how the choice of the spokes@@ person is changed . of course , you must of course have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with reading can begin as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop orders on the card card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional character filters are automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ sm@@ r for the first time . he can not switched off , just removed . change anything at this Filter , unless you know what you do .

SB@@ D @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ News ( fresh ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen revisions .
if you have removed from the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional power filter , you can insert it again by loading the file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the cardboard card , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
the use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card card speaker ) . in other words , there are no inter@@ phone features .
using the appropriate intercom system , which has all features of an equipped microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , chosen &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from , which is most commonly referred to the originally mentioned features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speakers . if this property plays no role , do not give anything .
select this indication if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings below .
since the language is a critical factor when using the issue , this is always treated as a priority feature . you will not use this feature rarely . the only case where you may need to specify the attribute language if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which corresponds to the next to the following , click on the button @-@ button and then use on spokes@@ person who corresponds to the following below .
in this case 0 is set for the last text contract in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the input number is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r cr@@ ashes away when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio @-@ passing on AL@@ SA does not work if I stop at the same time using another application music . if I get a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears , which says : Si@@ to open PC@@ M .
on your system the problem is that conflicts at AL@@ SA can occur that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r does not show this voice .
add the new voice into the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed and equipped with the ambient variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; and HTML ; default . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely mu@@ ly , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l @-@ file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML format filter , and set the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t manage that websites are read with a female voice . I have established a female colleague speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day SA@@ BLE Gender does not work to work . thus , the festival does not produce mistakes , thro@@ ws the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ but the gender @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string composition filter , and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ - or go back . on the cardboard orders it will be displayed , the order is wrong only from a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , frac@@ tory sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter you . instead , use a filter for the form of proposition .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during the audio edition . if your system also counts , you can not keep playing music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts , too , you can start a text contract and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de has not yet supported real breaks . if you hold a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will still be read .
the Audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the inter@@ phone speed but is otherwise not necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .

the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of these possess a running time dependent on non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) , the configure parameter option to switch the configure parameters that causes the transition to the adjustment .
a default setting is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example ,

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , inter@@ phone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . want to pre @-@ read websites you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
this voice consists of 1,@@ 95 beta or a new one . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distribu@@ tions . therefore , take the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it produces the audio edition . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete voice system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; n@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; to allow the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module can be displayed in &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu @-@ menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured to configure &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the adjustment of the network features enables .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version .
the module settings will be loaded , if the option is selected in the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module settings , this , the platform used by the system is automatically recognized .
if the platform can not be recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best suited . by flag@@ ging the setting Not @-@ again query , the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically adjusted .
the change of the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are shown gray , which means , the settings can only be considered , the changing mode is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can access the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the defined network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button set up ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button below shows dialogue with further options .
the TCP / IP settings fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are carried out at the same time using the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information on each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , are selected .
with the selection Manu@@ als can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP @-@ configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the backing mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated , depending on the need , and turn off on the switched network . it takes place by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be activated or de@@ activated , depending on the need , and turn off of a activated network . it takes place by selecting from the list and setting up of the interface .
defines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ categories .
if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the network , where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine is htt@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , it dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to the nam@@ ach@@ ment part of the equ@@ ator solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through selection of an order and up @-@ up or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons or can be ordered in top priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the nam@@ es@@ tion solution , a DNS server can add a DNS server . it will be added to the dialog &apos;s New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group machine to the name solution , select an entry and then click Edit ... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list specifically known machine describes calcul@@ ating IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boat if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list contains name as well known computers , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . still , in the test , the version of IP is to be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog new alias will be added .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known calculator has multiple alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s dialog will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then hit by OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , it must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command must be replaced .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) ranges from when &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t inst@@ alls .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as paste or the installation tool of your distribution may be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; Qu@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should achieve this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of the configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x will only provide basic information about the involvement of the PC in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated by TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . by IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP address is a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , which is a valid IP address or , if available , can be used to D@@ H@@ CP . definitely the IP address can not be chosen as desired !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular for that purpose to avoid IP address connections with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the field of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 is used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the two @-@ line address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has been assigned to a one @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part the configuration files that are affected by &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf : and where they are stored in the different distribu@@ tions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections , so that it is no surprise if in case of active DSL connections to a different content than fixed there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; soldier ; is a backup programme for band drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar that presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective ex@@ iting . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secur@@ es it ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; soldier ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; soldier ; sp@@ ult the band and reads the pr@@ est@@ res@@ sing information of the banker . recognizes &amp; soldier ; the pres@@ et upon the tape is not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted .
realize &amp; soldier ; the ruler , is searching for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be newly created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the band@@ work is to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through out @-@ of @-@ time the application for the band .
before taking the banker , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; soldier ; gives a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration has been solved for the band and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded out without danger .
before a tape of &amp; soldier , can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; soldier ; form@@ atted .
a band @-@ types need to be form@@ atted before you can be used for saving data . this procedure does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; soldier ; this procedure is not to be form@@ atted before you start the tape of &amp; soldier ; form@@ atted is usually a form@@ atting of the bands , DA@@ T drives on the other hand not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity is running &amp; soldier ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all the data on the tape is lost . after completion of the formation process , the band will automatically be integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the securing files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be saved in the profile specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Edit ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog will open up settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the disk . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the audit process has been started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the folder &apos;s folder .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear to assess . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ connect the restore , the files you need to be restored , this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry network . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu again ...
once the re@@ creation process has been started , the dialog will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the folder level for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be re@@ producing . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ read@@ x@@ file on the basis of the Band@@ read@@ ed file . this process del@@ etes all existing Inde@@ x@@ files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
below will create a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for backup profile :
the current operating folder in which the backup is to be carried out . the list of securing files will be automatically updated according to the selected operating folders .
for all folders listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , like the folder . folder that are stored on other fil@@ esystem , you can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshots file will be used . only the files you have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup are created .
the functionality of the buttons files are gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the full path to device driver for the network drives ( usually / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ren@@ al version of the band@@ man .
if this attitude is active , transm@@ its &amp; soldier ; before the band is mounted to load the load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or sp@@ elling operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , temp@@ ted &amp; soldier ; the dro@@ pping out of the band@@ work process . perhaps this attitude does not work with all belt drives .
is the option turned on , becomes the loos@@ ening of the incorpor@@ ation of &amp; soldier ; automatically the tape un@@ mounted . use this option not at flo@@ ppy stream .
is the option enabled , temp@@ ted &amp; soldier ; the hard@@ ships support variable block@@ ers . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must communicate &amp; soldier ; in any case the block @-@ size for your band@@ work will communicate .
when &amp; soldier ; a tape form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the banker . this file should occupy only one storage block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is fixed : seconds , whereby the name is the complete name of the system in which the tape is form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band has been form@@ atted .
the band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ ministry .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can run directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup database . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for unauthorized users who can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . additionally , experienced users enables quick access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; P@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system determines the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; P@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced functions , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; P@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions are among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen shot , &amp; P@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start trying &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the most important log file of the system - the system &apos;s protocol - to open it . it will not be shown that a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system re@@ wal@@ k@@ right . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter on a selected criterion or sub@@ trac@@ ed strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . in default , a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns contain the string of the filter .
you can of course select another entry at this point . select the text string of the filter protocol . select for example in the protocol @-@ file system prot@@ ector . select the name of a process so it shows you &amp; P@@ system@@ log ; all protocol rows sent to , which were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed using a show@@ y color as a protocol @-@ lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off with dialog dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filtering .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new added protocol lines .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. find out more information about the sources of &amp; P@@ system@@ log .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log , you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; KDE ; Subversion archiving : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; KDE ; System V in@@ it Editor , known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; sy@@ s@@ v .
the V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard for controlling programme @-@ start at the peak of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about yourself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V in@@ it without having a new installation and new format . therefore you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc directly into / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start up the system or change onto another Run@@ level . system services contain such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services contain not such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such call belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you do it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default Run@@ level is included in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably you find that the aforementioned Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can carry out / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you have done something through , then you come to repair the system re@@ boot and execute the following :
but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no correct files are . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the a K includes , the script will be called with the argument . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ Run@@ level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; b ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointer is easy to say not to say , just drag one entry from the range of av@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift the way between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the field of availability system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and insert in the target area , even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to include the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ s button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous ones .
to move one entry to another Run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of a request , press the input button to switch the properties dialog . use the dialog button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or push ES@@ C to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise , changes to the preferences will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts anew . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of your distribution .
the way that system services can be started in these distribu@@ tions , but does not correspond to the configuration for the proprietary furnishing programs of these distribu@@ tions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply quit if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual may be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ; to read .
