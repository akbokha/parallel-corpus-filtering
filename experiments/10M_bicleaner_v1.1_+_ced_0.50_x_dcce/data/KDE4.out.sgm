<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only part of the entire & URL is translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary translation. babelfish produced in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations are no important decisions depending on the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to you on the baboufish page itself where you can put into overhauling texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & Conqueror; despite its small size, they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & Conqueror; by these readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on the use of & Conqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & Conqueror;</seg>

<seg id="12">To use the DOM building view in the & Conqueror; to use extras DOM tree show... and then open a new window with the DOM of the document displayed. as a default setting begins the display with the root section of the document, example: DocumentElement, all the other knots are sub-elements of this root box.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-type inode / directory at local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists in calculating folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. Tree-Maps allows the display of size of objects in slipping structures. each object is proportional to its size. this size has to possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or a folder, whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it. thus, large files, even then can easily be recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands thou be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the tread depiction a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. easier navigation possess the rectangle of useful colour and lettering settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on display color mode, can be either depth for the easy detection of the bolts or illustration of another file, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be described with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify if it is available at all, only if the area is available at all or whether the area of subordinate hedges should occur. furthermore, you can define the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Daring algorithms for Treemaps, the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the magnitude of the entry. in the treatiation in & FSView; this goal is not always observed. it will be drawn to be no longer available under the subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As sharing the area of an application for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to us. in this context it is important for the shelving and for the avoidance of space losses due to always beneficial the surfaces are so inseparating that justification are possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; as a small test of testing and introduction into the use of the TreeMap widgets developed, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale DeterManagement takes up, categorized, categorized, assures, transformated, confected and exports content that have a monary or cultural value. "quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data on data. metadata are available in accordance with your definition data, which provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you'll find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even need to find a certain photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digitising; the approach will save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guaranteed very quick search and secure archiving to the you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you have to cultivate something inside your system is the structure of information in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be arranged on your computer, whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drives & etc. take note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation images can quickly be found via your location. if you are using enough photos, then you will apply subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use, then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as sioning of photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% working files are not organized and you will then do not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing simpler. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a managed image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend this option to save metadata in the setup page of the metadata in & digitising; that ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget that, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which to change? it provides & checking that an metadata editor for a number of selected attributes are available. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now select any photo keywords, lettering and an evaluation. of course you can choose all the images that will need the same attribute and then set the value then. you start at best with the rating or the leaderboard. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now take keyword with keywords, keyword as you often proceed to other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import the catalogical images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree will create images in the correct place. the transcription of the Hierarchy inside of the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling an undertree on one another. the changed keywords are taken by & digitising; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata reps. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file names and calender data are characteristic of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to cataloate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most anyone your photos just let you see them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from distance not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French mandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you might even listen to the silence. so the caption thus has changed your perception of this panoramic position completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit to Him about the motive that you moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for himself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & checking, you can store any amount of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8). you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE can even export it to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of the web-gallery. you will have to tell the story for the reopening-btedness no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find into another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train from the spatial presentation is already working with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of the geolocation are already innumerable and will be able to repeat in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also repeat the photos at the reception. you can also export the photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; using the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and calls the practice to use copyrights, to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, thus also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is available in the furnishings page of & As audited; as a information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for manufacturers and authors): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. after that value it should not be changed. this field does not support Komma nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for fibre-line): linked to the author. examples of this can be title like: photographer photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. as this is a comment on the author, it must be filled with it as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily be the author. if the photographer can be listed here for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is a store photo, then the group / Agency will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change it. the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals this protection is only very important for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection against it is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image once itself; it will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: tables, record loss, power lines, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disrupture, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we are not talking about CDs that can happen on the street or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper bags or negative. in this section there is problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data creation company in the world, has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must also trust CDs and DVDs in archives. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives. of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your immeasurable way.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you use good Disks and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. therefore, it turns your correct selection.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very prone to errors even if you have just written it. therefore, they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control environment. despite this massive protection, it requires by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged floppy disks, disks, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatorium against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixteen the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Then burn slowly with a good recording on high-quality media in a non-sufficient format. also read the media with a description, date & author marks and afterwards to a clean, dark dry and protected on animals protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dismanufacturer retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google presents to this issue a big field study on the troubleshooting of hard drives: diserror study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: Disks maintain the longest when you are operated in the tempered range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. in lower tempering errors, the error rate increases the most common fault of error, SMART may not notice these errors. these are especially legiefehler and publisher. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete loss due to overtension. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electric failure before you have secured the files but these losses can usually be produced without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices power cuts not a lot, it looks different from devices with computer chips and high-speed process. these can cause serious harm. on your computer these anomalies can cause pertampered keyboards, complete data loss, destructive motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself from the inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed by the energy heat and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. however, remember that not any plug-ins can also contain an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum protection. you should also take care of protecting the flash against flash and thus protecting the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a overvoltage of each cable is used to your computer, you should be careful that also all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers pose a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system before smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will provide you with a complete loss not really help. even an accident of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a lower power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a power loss occurs. some models allow them even further to work until the current runs again. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are filled with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the battery life and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern yourself the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety during electricity disorders, with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your machine protects it. at the end you should always remember all the cables before you travel to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux; to use Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are at home in comparison to the hard drives, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively long-slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution but it is not a general security solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com are available online store services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version is much more available, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unrestricted memory, which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically reconciled thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offering a backup and a partial storage. thus, they are disastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs make at least the data integrator between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all of these malfunctions remain undiscovered until you have not been destroyed by one day. nobody seems to have been thought in your computer. nobody seems to have been thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supply are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within the data streams. in normal filesystems this errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors on low levels and is available under one of the GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btral file system. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in notebooks, the percentage of the theft amounts 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think. it is currently limited to fewer damage than theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time, no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, Exercises, JFS and XFS to call on the common filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigator at a sudden break during operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. if a file has not been completely stored before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the root causes for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and smoke characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 meapixic sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compactors and the final result is more worsening for compactors. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">An 750GB disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make any other loss for data loss. so do your data frequently affect a plan and test this backup before you can do something else just like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of records or the size of hard disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes, you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot. forget Aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasteration always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs up to the neighboring building, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a full copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a complete snapshot of the files have been changed since the last complete payment. generates a full snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last time. it creates several moments. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system next with the exception that it is only secluded and non-continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync just the difference of files that were really changed. this is done and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved on your computer to DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come out for the backup however with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every further outgoing should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored on the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reuse pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you genuinely interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to consider everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option considered to be compatible with caution. unfortunately, there is no other option considered to be compatible with the current system. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go that you have been holding the scalability with bearing and the area you want to enlarge at a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software more you can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save a lot more. it is verlustfree, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can have gamma information but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your images in this format. however, there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open raw-format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata. a handful of camera controllers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe its XML based XMP technology introduced to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with enlargement & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can happen to problems when you link between the metadata file and image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a large area of usage purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI, the work of architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the cameredium are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finred editing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & checking, then you should add the metadata again. these were subcutted by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only to Webgaleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos inside & digitising; you will find a description of how to add photos, which you already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertilizer appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not appear thumbnails. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol of file attachments are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to any entry. with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturerremark, GPS etc. the image. this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of & digitising; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from you. this loads all the photos from their camera into a single album in & digitising; when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before installing the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired with the default output methods of & KDE; once you selected the photos, use the button Download and then download the selected item. the button selected is selected as long as you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported this, an option is new to download. these images have not been downloaded by & digitising; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the padlock. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons All download or chosen to download it, appears a dialog with which you can select the target album, shown in the photos. details on the folder sorting you can read in the section My records. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & D came; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all deleted from the camera. if you want to delete all of them, you need to select them first and remove the delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the trash bin of & KDE; they were completely deleted before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete them completely from the camera. if you want to delete them completely from the camera. if you want to delete the camera file completely, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename often not particularly expressive names. these filenames are usually used again after the photos of the camera were deleted. therefore, it can be recommended to double filename in the same album. therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for datory-based submissions. if you use this latter option automatically, one folder is created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transmission opens three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard authentication fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use for example in the machining field the prefix photo -% m-%% H:% M. switch to the option Date & Time Add. for more adjustments you should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & checking came; for a photo used, is displayed below the name which provides the camera in the preview. your settings for rename are stored and automatically used when you open the camera door.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitising; may use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time record, to carry out an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras make this information ready. in section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually enabled, and if your camera does not supply this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made information about the date on which the photo has been made available, can be made available to download automatically. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras make this information available. in the section page meta data you can read what information your camera can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case saves & digitising; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch to this option and select the option dates at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is to download. select the file selector dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the choice choice is done, asks & digitising; you, where the images are to be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select here the desired folder and press OK to load the high load. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that can be indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to ographs an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was made, you can open with one click of a browser which indicates the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digitization; users want to locate the place of the photo therefore, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to transmit the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 are supported, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographic assignment (manual) and finally over the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or through the transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyoteEye by iPQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in gpx format since this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from pictures and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude, or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-used coordinates that are created for example from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Eco-google.com shows no European road cards. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected when downloading the camera file. also with a database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Car title is a synonym for fibre-line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be (s) as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description on the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to define the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is a photo agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here as these are the other & quot; anecenquot;. if the image is a store photo, the group or agency should be enumerated here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rim. this will be achieved that the metadata are permanently available in the picture and not only arrived in the database of & digitising; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into & checking.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image described as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this is synchronised the comments that you may add to your photos, with the embedded in pictures. please note: in pictures that have already fuses, these are written by those of & checking; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance can be placed on this page. every time you can then open the luminaire. some pictures have however different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size S & quot; if you have one, then you can get better vision results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can switch the toolbar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors will be set here. in the picture processing the View Mode with F10 and F11 can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, it is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG-Compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is not reducing the image quality since PNG. this is the only effect that the image data is more time for training and packaging. if you have a quick computer, you can use this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files, you can switch the Deflate compression salmon for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF. it has no influence on the image quality because the debrate algorithm is tempted-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of the free JPEG-2000 files, you can edit it freely. even if you choose the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata were not yet supported, but was in the planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & checking, the image processing was only a picture-considering for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard gain is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option with a minimum loss of ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 lattice patterns with the VNGC or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the whiteboard is used immediately of the camera. otherwise, if used, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the whiteboard is not set right. standard is it a fixed balance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details appear in the slide show. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shredder, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera you begin to view the slide show, as it shows the clichter in various rosatrains. lastly, you can try to re-construct some parts of missing information from the sheways.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel generally does not move so fast satile like green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course, this is a matter how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to reconstruct a level, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminaire value to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than standard 1. this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digitising; image processing is made. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial filtered image sensor that have many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& D came; and Dziw sets you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. however, it creates color boards at the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution using an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-deviation of your lenses, you can put the rotor and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color-resolution corrected, since you are carried out during the trial.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digitising; information like the colour information of a color tree in the other are to be translated as accurately as possible.</seg>

<seg id="314">Color profile folder Are you here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / color / user / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digitising; examine this folder then during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed while opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colorfully does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain dytoned or gamma correction. currently, this means that you do not have to perform the color mapping for you.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image has been given off from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer can handle a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore highly saturated. this could be manually correct, rather than to rely on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not for the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is of course inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expands the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & KDE; images and image editing. by installing this interface can & digitising; many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then loaded from & digitised; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command.</seg>

<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt /, where you can attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & checking, you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it into the ad mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether or digitising; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera amodel and Port manually after you have set your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>

<seg id="334">The adjustment Beim starts to search for new photos and digitising; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the starting time of & checking out; if something was deleted from the basic folder, asks & digitising; you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digitising; used to adjust the main window to your tastes. these settings can be selected under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & checking, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitising; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improve. image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to enhance your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitising; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you will find in section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, filename, and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge and below the toolbar to quickly access the most used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining function of the image processing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the original photo or the button save from the toolbar. note that you can not restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should be able to customize a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save save as a file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original picture by using the menu File Recovery or the button The button Rescue the image processing restore the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting the Edit Replacement or restored by selecting Edit restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make yourself the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z, to return and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; above the back-up or restore button in the toolbar you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also undo or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the editing process, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar. if you made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or use the entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar icons automatically select</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode, the photo shows in full screen mode. you come into the normal view, in which you do not want to edit the Esc button. normally, you can change this in the setting dialog from & digitising; change this can be taken from the & checking of this window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print in the menu File menu and get the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sets. entire images can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album Exporting printers. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitising; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which is important information and actions available for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, even in the editing process. it is displayed when one of the five horsemen is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab will appear in the sidebar or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can insert letins with unlimited size or insert them. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters will be defined. if you want to use the IPTC overlating field in other applications, you should be aware of these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After having commented it, you can either use the button or simply change the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the apply-button, there is a button More. with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata adjustment which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select this off and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written in the IPTC field. encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords showing a search box for the filtering of the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously used in this & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is dynamically adapted to the search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords at a picture series. if you typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markings of the corresponding bond fields in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main menu and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this only appears on the highlighted picture and not applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, -, catchor and supreviews. if in addition one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two is displayed. all the keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop your keywords in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter stands on no keywords which was reduced the amount to three pictures. they were drawn with Strg + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keyword to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched between settings too.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created you will find that it's a or being, you can easily change it with a double-clicking on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to be searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example you can specify a extended search across all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options are then shown as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorful workflow using the colors that are actually photographed from your camera or scanner. with a colored workflow, you can achieve that colors on your monitor use those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web are conform to those from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everybody wants to know which buttons it must push for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions on each point of image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial is to give you links with deeper information make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image are met all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB mode. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or the web where sRGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and life for everyone so easy, why should one use a different color tree and thus have to make thoughts about shades of color?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitization of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see, the hufeeous region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional reproduction of sRGB with some larger farms, then visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and then click information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I put my monitor to my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB Farbraum?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working at the RGB Farbraum or not, you have to work your Monitor kallibrigate, since sRGB means that your; onitor is installed on sRGB, then you have to use your monitor at sRGB of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the RGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to get further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize the same, automatic and contrast expand out of the menu corrigier Automatic correction is automatically trying to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which affects the best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method involves the luminosity values over the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color shaded. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Equated: this method reeds the luminosity of the colors of the selected image, so that the halogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces just rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which causes a wonder at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scanned: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue-channel. you determine the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green- and blue-channels on the complete hoistograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible areas and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible when used images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whiteboard line of & checking came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-like of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The whitehole correction is somewhat limited because of a color tree with 8-bit per colour. if you can therefore perform too far from the original picture, in case you can perform the white-like in the blank mode, which works in the 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a whichequinage of Pawel T. Jochym protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it with the menu entry of white lacquered colours.</seg>
<seg id="397">The screen saver can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the image. the Preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whip right again, then it is enough to click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination photos has a red marker. the Luminator of pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the Histgram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a Histogram appears that dynamically changed as soon as you change a parameter. this Histogram is very helpful there, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels very small Luminanzines have. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminator.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows can be used to enhance your photos or also download them.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls should play, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then go anywhere on the picture-show to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the whitefoot. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the whiteboard with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indiindicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of pixels is overexposed.. you will display the combined result in the whiteboard. this is shown in the Preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">To save the buttons as well as loading exactly this. each setting of the white can be set, you can save it in a text file and then load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob button presupposes all filter values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white. please note that neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will change.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the encoding panel per colour channel of the supplied image. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality pictures. this coding requires also more turnaround, datactation and is just available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens up the same dialog as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles. colour can be done through the subwindow for the use of color profiles. detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be noted in Chapter Color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu among colors sound corrections. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same correction, therefore you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option of exposure problems is the tool for engraving that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitising; tool color effects provides you four color effects, a solar-effect effect, a bike via filter, a neon effect and a beholder.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar lization, also Sabatier is called, an effect of the model developed by a short flash. this had the effect that the brightest areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool permits you to adjust the image negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible. an additional increase finally generates a negativity scene that is not to produce on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar-effect effects. the original image is the (1) and that is edited (2). the applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaqua; effect. it distinguishes itself from a satifying effect that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliantly and glowing. try it simple, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight, turned color film made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaqua; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography. Velvias strong saturated colors are also some photographs, especially those which hardly eased landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in big images the filter can hold the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color of color and illuminate the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your permission are happy to preview you in the preview below. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo of bad light conditions, you can reduce the reverse problem: a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool engraving and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma is the tool of sound corrective to the improvement of the exposure. even if the dialog on this tool seems very complicated, you need for the purpose specified here only the area of the slider. concrete the three slider beneath the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the intensity, a Histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slider to the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright fields.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is the regulator to move and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image will be looked at. the Preview will be dynamically based on the settings of the picture. on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this combo box can be set if the holder is shown with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera is frequently dominating the linear representation of a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is usable.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shade, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values, e.g. for input values. compression of output values can be used e.g. for it to create a hidden image as background while taking something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the images are automatically set according to the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the embedded values can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded again. this becomes the Gimp level format used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color tabs, the input values will automatically be adjusted to all shadows, resources and sun sounds. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminanzcanals.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed indiindicator controls all colours in order to be overexposed and to display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, the half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification Channel: this combo box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that were taken using a digital camera is usually linear mode. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is helping.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a cursor to the right, e.g. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright notes with darker output powers, and that the associated image was darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is to see a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line on the curve displays the original value. create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each turn that you created can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipples -buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposed indiindicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in Lumince canal. shadow and sun sounds are placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-Mixer of the & D came; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool to mix the shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selector, you can select the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left panel of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to the own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target area has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line is displayed in the Histogram to show you the corresponding color.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you can also keep the corresponding color components, as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos is. try to reduce the green canal for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrom, the reduction of a color leads to a visible rustling, which occurs in the colour canal and whose smoking pattern looks different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrom conversion thereby in which you can reduce the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed indiindicator controls all colours in order to be overexposed and to display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white was a working step, because colour images can be converted to the machine. even with a set of film-roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good in all sceneries and fits particularly well to portrait against heaven. so similar to 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air-pictures. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic sky-effects and can simulate moonlight on the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotors.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gel filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color visual correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the shadow of a pressure and the resale in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitising; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to apply to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop style portrait of enlarged points or like a wall-picture on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tridimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper editor effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief parameter is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Using the & digitising; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a spectator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streetching eye. under the frame frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you put the desired cream type for your image. thoroughly transduces the picture with a colored line, Niepce encore it with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black-white pictures), crashed it with a cute three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button-off effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value-area for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the scope of decoritised target will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you cut the tool After aspect ratio previously.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use text device, orientation, color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need. you will simply select the character size of the image size. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK." after the picture was saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digitising; tool shablone apply you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put circuits on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG format and should be added with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. whom you want to add your stencil of the file size. whom you want to add your template in English to the & checking account; mailing list checking came-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your template folder with the button Base Folder. select the folder in which you have copied the folder files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template has been set, a building view, which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Beneath the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button magnifies the underlying image. it is centered around the position of mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button resized the underlying image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to scale the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to postpone the picture under the template. take the image and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be matched to the default size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& D came; provide three different tools for sharpening. each one of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharply. actually, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common colour. this in turn leads to a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if shades are printed on paper. SLR cameras require more tightening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Black pictures often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the shell-format on the other hand must always be used during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a sharpened filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable it, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by calling for a photo with the sharpening effect. this allows you to call with the menu entry of corrigidity.</seg>
<seg id="487">But they should deal with this but the results are not very natural; the sharpness increases the edge of the edges, but also amplify the rustling technique for the sharpening of an image the tool refocus. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is a crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool for softening with the menu entry of corrigidity and experiment with something with settings. the front panel on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview picture shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are frequently generating good results and should first try out. an increase in radius or of the amount reinforce the effect. if you create the blur mask, rustling and the impression of graten in the proximity of sharp edges are generated.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is one how many pixels on each side of a edges are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the blender image one of the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. one can thus define a minimal difference thus for a channel of the filters. in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and hence beauty in faces, Heavens and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited picture (2). blur masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sleeve = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitising; tool refocus refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to be protected by the copyright algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to blunt. this is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. they usually use a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus mostly better results as unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by entering colors refocussing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular fission works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which depends far from the original squeezed pixels. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular fission. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results. you can bet a higher value if your image is very blurred, but then on halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value is even more bladed the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. this is most often caused by a blender filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoker filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformationrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß'schen sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you choose great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocussing parameter that you set will have set it for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimmer, color and integer corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masks produce better results as raising it. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masonry always must generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal lineare filter at least as good as the blender mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for the field of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte is the imacuity of the area of the shading, to generate a natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color cloth allows for a customized color for the pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image infallized is one of the most developed tools to not remove the desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The intra algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presettings as a starting points to simplify the restoration. the options available are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of the details. a small value leads to an evenly smoothing about the image. and a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening is required. please note that the detail-keeping always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Set-dependent alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie granularity, or the CCD Rauschen will produce a high value of wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glitter factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of smoke in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: returns how often the algorithm is going through. usually there is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, there should also be small chosen. make sure that small angles can produce a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride-wide [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More on Quality you get through Selection of this option is only minor. he doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. any setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and take a high CPU load to move. therefore, you can cancel the calculation any time with the button abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove images with small artifacts. the module is placed on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey is wurdel.The original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & checking came; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable filter filters available to remove spots and other artefacts, for example from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory escape from the camera or Moiards; effects of scanned images of books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about Sensorting cameras of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular smoke which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel required and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is moving over the image and color in it is smoothed and hence minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening of the filter. this value requires the pixelabt the filter appears to determine fluorescent filters. you may have to re-adjusted the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters can no longer receive and rustle or blackberries again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or smokes can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watchman or JPEG artefacts, without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Lightness: controls the luminosity of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the shade of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark ones, which typically are amplified amplified, but he also spends the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: monitors the alignment of the Phasenjitteriness. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted when it is too high can occur. if he is up to his minimum, spacers and phasenjitter can occur in the edges. he can remove spacers and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save below and loading: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for smoking reduction that you have set can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how a smokescreen can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected one with (2). the smoking reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is to be crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softening with the menu entry of corrigidity and experiment with the glasses. the front panel on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo results.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to show gauge's grazing, scratch-pressed and local errors that emerge in digital, original or retroactively digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textiles. the text replacement is done with a different tool, the infalligraphic image, the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannella and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compressages, he creates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and loading exactly this. any setting of photo Restoration can be saved into a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with DC-shaped smoke. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film granularity on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected one below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo Restoration. this time textures has been reduced to an old color picture that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts identified by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitising; tool Hotpixels allows the hotspot from photos which were gem with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixel are especially in high-quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixels" "" "; and" "" "bright pixels" "" "; and" "" "bright pixels." "" "there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to absorb the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. please note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result. the preview picture shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all the viewpoints.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the broken pixel and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is calculated as an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interval, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixelblock, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these will then be used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn up to calculate a bi-kubische surface (2-dim) or a group of kubische curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotspot correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; Vignettifier corrective is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Vastly objective, especially the medium-sized and large photo format, often the whole sensor sector cannot be evenly illuminated. instead & quot; vignetworkmen; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there. teleobjective may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has cons. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with hand. vastly items should use, also using center filters, an opening of f / 16 or small, as otherwise unsharpensive effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large popularity areas of today's film and colour-depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centertaion transformation in a raw image that is used without this filter. the tool of vignettiation applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignettifier tube and with three further exposing the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminosity at the point of the biggest density the filters. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture of 1, or by chance to compensate a greater degree of vigneting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Lighting strength, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the Vignettifier corrective reduces the lightening of the target image with these options. the regulator will only provide positive values because you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile refine of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitization; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifier corrective to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vigneting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminosity and contrast correction was also carried out at the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & checking came; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the impact of celestial lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colorful distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or conveexe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect, but on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gradient. if you combine these two can be eliminated almost eliminated each geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally, this value checks the strength of the distortion second gradient. with negative values, tons-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values of feces.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value checks the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value acts stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the inverted precursor of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient. negative values enlarge while positive the image has decreased.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value readed the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correct. the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or hovertical correction should be done before all tricision or size changes. best perform this correction as all first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tons-shaped correction, the effect is apparent to the flanges.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to help you display this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the tons / paste with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a crash-shaped distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can transform it using the trimmer tool in the menu, cut it from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons-shaped correction ranges from the front. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the Gimpguru. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range from 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the window of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film granularity and filmsensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows will be white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters can produce colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared cinematic effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitising; filter film granularity is an easy to use tool to reproduce film granularity on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of movies, the makers mix large silver-baskets of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. in case you want this specific, gallery-like, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains are calibrated. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more basins, so you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granular effects applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitising; filter oil painting, creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses the copyrighted protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitising; filter oil gemälde gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and stylistic life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to affect this effect. the upper selects the pinching size between one and five out. thicker brushes are suitable for big images. smooth controls the smoothing or, from the other side, considers the uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is with the (1) and the processed is equipped with (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitising; filter coal-drawing uses color and intensity, to generate a calf in the drawing. the lines whose gradient can change slowly therefore are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketching you. this would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value-range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon recording filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adapting the performance value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitising; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was striped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitising; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. he works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, moneous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in a artwork by means of distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: shares the image in cells and leaves it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in a artwork by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blur: blurks the picture along sternfoerde lines that go from a center. this simulates the blur a zoomiting camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in the photography photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurks the image by rotation of the pixels to a central point. this simulates the blender of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Remove instiff: blurks the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion invoked: blurks the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the unsharpening of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train to photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softbox nonsense: twisted the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright killing. this is created photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelevine: blurks the picture by random shift of the pixels and simulates the sharpness of a random camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the colour sink in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a real look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drip. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number is changing the number and density of drops. fishermen changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digitising; image editing a range of rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, for example a face, which shall be free to stay. if you start to the filter drops, the area will stay free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of rain drops. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transform turning or transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you keep an image inflatable and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again or guessed? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use one type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitising; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are considered below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio keep it: if this attitude is enabled, entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly. each entry fee for photo can be enlarged as a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load to move. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating, by adding a small colour image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification as compared.</seg>
<seg id="640">Adding a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a commonly underestimated tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows you to simply create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle then you'll see the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again the area of the photo will cut off the way. you can change the size of the triangle after cutting. you can change the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button The dial-button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save File Save File Save button to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">You can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse by moving the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After page-ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you use inches, incch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog box exist two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialogue you can use the Max. relationship to the area to cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontally or vertical). if you use the random tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF data and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of co-operation help enable help to put them better together in order to put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partial forms are based on the principle of similarity. as the Third elregel, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that overlook various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shells, or the tenders of a sunflower. it emerges in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci episode 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 13, 34, 13, 34, 34, 21, 34, 34, 21, 34, 13, 34, 21, 34, 21, 34, 21, 34, 21, 34, 21, 34, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21. 1 composition which is usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid aid lines if you put an image together. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring your goal good results for your photos to get closer. compared to the third party, the golden spiral generated a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral, and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called Golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye appears at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can just be there without being the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also derived from the above golden spiral angles. your vertices are the midpoints of the pages of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are not a hindent triangles. diagonal the lines can place a statious object of dynamical.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you want to cancel a golden triangle to set out your frame you create an effect of a professional photo-graph dynamic Symmetry. try to place your picture fosters at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical can be used to reflect the harmonic partial components.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the Help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy if you're not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates an image in which things are directed to an angle. you can fix this with the & checking; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform it into free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this shoot are specified in degrees. with the button prepreferences you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module provides free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is the function transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the function Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, consider the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All prospective transformations are conducted by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the Preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas which have been created through transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas which have been created through transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right on the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective the image becomes a little wasted. for individual adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to bersome it is the image to capture, cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The track tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no spin, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a Parallelogram. you can start this module over transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you press the settings, the angle will display on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the folder tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have performed the shot, the picture becomes a bit confused. for a single shot this effect is usually neglected, but two shalizations created twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After installation, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform it into image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& D came; needs a number of libraries and other packages for image formats to read and write. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries were computed. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & checking.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& D came; shows only files in formats that are known. this is done by the file expansion and a comparison of these with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of file extensions the & digitising; accepted. configuration can be found in the configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to choose to select the format. a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia, supports both formats.</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains of course data recorded at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation carried out the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdata is recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera data is recorded with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone here. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and cameration. lies the deviation below the data will be combined. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the difference between 2000 seconds will then be correlated any images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in min. can be used when you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a local difference in a large difference between camera and GPS is, you can put these boundaries here and then press the button correlate to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog you need to use the coordinates by a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The locality can also be found and placed with the indicated map and enlarge. select this again and again through until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the card can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite channels and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="823">The module has four riders on which the settings can be customized. the tab allows you to select all the albums now. the albums are not hierarchically indicated. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums. in the area below, you will quickly see a large number of albums at the bottom of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely explicable. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image is displayed directly with your standard image, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated pictures. select a folder that you typed to write. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which includes everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the standard colordepth. naturally, the file size also influences the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider's thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails which are small images to be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process down.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programings to determine whether errors occur during production. the web browser will automatically start in the end to preview the preview of the gallery. click Connect to join the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image consider is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool in order to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image does not allow you to look at a selection of pictures and to perform on them basic operations such as rotation, zooming or depletion. the spectator can be used with shorts and mouse. it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but do not write into any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please see exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodifier module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodifier module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages mjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a base pattern. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be automatically scalable to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first must select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can start using extras MPEG Diaschau to create the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then enumerated under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sort of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can select from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should let them black. the name and the path of the file created you can set under name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start with the button code. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go safely or in complete peace and enjoy the slideshow once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MJpegTools and ImageMagick Packages on the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper into standard photographies. the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g.: sensible to improve you or using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images into one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF, or PPM or convert.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera performers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the rew image window appears then in mode for a single image. with the button Preview can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white can be used. the essential parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the output results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW Compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are going to frequently edit your pictures or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format before the image quality is worsening. TIFF and PPM are better adjusted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata are stored in the raw file contained in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start with the execute button start converting. if you want to cancel this process again, you can finish off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode therefore if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the option to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful in case this one has been created in a former attempt. however, the progress bar is not available as far the conversion speed is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of time.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. these are available in four types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the additional images before. more images can be drawn to the list of images and drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the images will display images with the pictures selected by you. over the button images you can add further pictures with a file selector. for the last selected image will preview a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images on the picture-list and add you to the list of images to be found here.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected images will be removed from the list of images to be removed from the list below.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail clients. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you select are already attached to the Appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be sure to send it too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of the E-mails. it's possibly a good idea to send emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and every time used again until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you have to install the GMailagent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selection of comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossfree formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should therefore use PNG if you have a quick Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG using pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original exception data will be added to the existing images.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can see the status messages, looking for mistakes. your e-mail programme will be automatically started at the end. with the button Connect, you can switch this window? s.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's advanced dialog box appears a window with questions like your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option of OpenGL transitions in presentation automatically activates very elegant image outputs by means of OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graphics card because otherwise the slideshow is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the filename can be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a repository loop. you can manually cancel it with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it's not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under the delay between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard. the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should try this before you show the presentation of your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses a different effect from any transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the preceding and the next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date is currently not documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-Imaging @ qude.org. attention: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module wallpaper is a tool to put an image as a background image for the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module is currently selected selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE-surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & photo album; through this browses, see image. as you can see by comparison with the picture, are now available in every group, so in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you search your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look at EXIF-based information, viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images. in the following each one is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">When you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can display with thumbnails to view the pictures of your impact.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, every person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can store with & photo album; however, for each person has its own preview image, that of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the name, select the button that you want to adjust to the right outside on the toolbar. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of individuals and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must however set yourself that image for each individual person will be displayed. to view this, you have to select the image editor, as shown in the picture. here you can customize the image factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call on the entry window, you will display a dialog box, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. this dialog can be viewed in the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the field of lettering or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you like, you can also be a date to be searched, so for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window, you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photo album;. if you do not like to read handbooks, but prefer to try out some features, you have the following alternatives to this handbook:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photo album; and see the quick entry, the screenshot and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and select in the first dialog the demo, in case you start & photo album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help menu entry. for example, some example images are loaded and you can try the features of & photo album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & photo album; as an associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photo album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display you multiple different time units. each bar shows you a different unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the Preview pane) and in addition, the timeline is always shown the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select one area of the timeline by holding the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the timestamps. if you select an area, you will only view images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photo album; put together two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & cold album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book, the software version is described in & photo album; integrated version that you can create using the menu HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and finish. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the survivor and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on cold album; HTML-example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & photo album; export file is to be created on the page page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML pages. for example, that information is displayed by a party. for example, that you can use all the pictures from a party. for example, that you can use all images from a party. for example, you can use this setting therefore to hide specific images from certain points.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clearly, which is why not specifically received on this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images. thus those who have to look at your website and have a monitor which supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images to download, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he'd like to show a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area you set the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to choose for all your HTML files, and then choose a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. you can select either a folder or folder by KDE supported protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if this really is all for viewers. if you choose to select a URL for the basic folder. the URL you set up should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you'll need to manually copy them there. thus, the import function, see, correctly, you need to specify the final destination of the files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have applied all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you define in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; however, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. if you're interested in an HTML page for viewing the pictures, then you need to write an HTML page, recording, then you must do with & photo album; this work doesn't even turn.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album, you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image features are externally and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored with the file or whether in the file only a shortcut to pictures is that you have all the images together and pass this file over independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the menu File Exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, it will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the images in two ways. first, the corresponding images are not found, so the images are displayed in the folder of .kim file. these are of course only possible if you created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for the portrayal of pictures described above the menu file Exporting... can be called.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When option Manual near the .kin file you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatic to copy the .kin file copy & photo album, the pictures will be automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures were compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually does not require the files to compress. if you want this, you can simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page contains maximum image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by example that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File importers... select, the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for Imported consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder you want to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category persons of the custom file personer (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window to import the categories of imported goods and what categories are displayed in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can edit the categories of imported goods with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and watch images: if you see images, you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will find the different steps from (1) Celebrate the information about your images, over (2) the throughs and prestige, through to (3) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it will also take care of your videos. on many places in this handbook there is spoken about pictures, but often this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; saves all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. standards backup tools, copy on a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where they would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; notes the folder in which your pictures are stored and used automatically again in future starts. if you want to read another database in & photo album; so you can start a different folder tree with images, you can start a different folder tree; with the option -c. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings of the photo album, set up... come to a window with which you can change the settings of & photo album; in the following section of the user manual, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons where you can preview settings and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described to you how to set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete members groups, e.g. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of explaining all groups of a mediator.</seg>
<seg id="956">To view the settings, which you are at your disposal of the membership groups. with the above list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left of the fenders there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& cold album; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image plugin Interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this handbook because they are not part of & photo album; however, but are separately distributed. however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules have been tested with & cphotoalbum; demo database, you can either call on the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum entry\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules using KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications does not support their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. this kind of order does not support, simulates the order for albums, so that you can use the features with & photo album;</seg>
<seg id="962">Are simulated & photographed album; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images, which shows you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & photo album, the modules also has to pass a list of albums. here's the photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you set in the setting dialog as category for virtual albums, so if you use the category persons, such as the category persons is used, so if you choose to have selected persons and pass this module to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setting dialog and choose in the area module, which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a launcher as soon as you start the photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As usual, you can see it from any other KDE application, see the window with which you browse your picture database. at the moment you will not see a lot of information about your pictures. in the section we will return to this window, now click on the picture pictures to show you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photo album; is the possibility to display any picture with notes. this includes information about persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can put any image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all the pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords, these are a very important part of & photo album; as you can always use them again if you have information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the images inside the list: if you have for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, you can find that the names you have moved upwards are to find the people faster and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to view a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture individually, you may want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes. click in this case simply to the front and back-buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries on a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture, you can see a browser window of the USA as a supergroup. to show you that this is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry simply to one category and take place to make this one subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires you just to sort out your category alphabetically. see this for you.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the proposition, by forming the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move from within a frame to drag it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... that offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also print a frame completely. if you want to get this window later again, use the button Options... and then click on the window to read / out. this action can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you want to display the entry pictures in the browser, you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or any images in case you have not set a filter here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply using the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be arranged as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture-pane. in case you do not have a window with an image collection, a new ad image will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the pictures. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete or select either the Delete button or select either the Edit menu. now, the window will display you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; for this problem you can use a solution. you can also use pictures somewhere, without you saved on the hard disk. of course you have to record the pictures somewhere, so that & photo album; in the picture you can see the view of & photo album; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. this is e.g. present on the pictures 1-9, but for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails can be displayed. however, you can preview these pictures with the image concerned.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature, you need to copy files from the folders and paste it back. & photo album; therefore, it still does not support you to record the record of the concerned CD. if you want to avoid a hassle of how to avoid the mess of your pictures, please purchase a bigger disk in order to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you want to unlock the images that you want to do for others. alternatively, you can also view all the pictures that can see your little sister, contaves and select the menu item all out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have specified which images are hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will be closed. if you want to get locked the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered into the unlock of the pictures. to set up this password, simply select a password in the menu of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means safe. for example, all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as unencrypted text, or delete it. this type of password protection is only for those who are using & photo album; not very familiar to wears the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you put all of your pictures with & photo album; manage and talk hours over hours to them is of course that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason you have to look at some picture _ and video views. this allows you to preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it naturally shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered via the picture, such as who is on the image when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox at the top of the image you want to see, you can easily drag and discard it with the mouse. you can also configure which information displayed and whether information is displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. then you can see the context menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see the matching entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and picture below. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as distiau. like often a new image invites you to be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus. started and stopped the Diaschau through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the observer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry key to switch to the full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can simply drag and pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can roll again zooming the plus button zoomed into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the same key points the zoom, so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and the key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Using the screenplay from the context menu, you can shoot the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you consider pictures it can happen to set a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set in the picture. in the moment you can view it off and open the configuration dialog of the image to insert this name. however, you'll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples at the top of the observer gives you the opportunity to display images with characteristics while you look at them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can squeeze a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in view, you can see a picture of which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the characteristics of your images, these are available in your browser. so you can see all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the thumbnail. if you can view categories in Dre thumbnail, then you can simply add features to the pictures by simply press the letters for the feature, after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you allow you & photo album; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image but in the database. in the way you can undo your old old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the game you can see a picture in the painted. to switch the painting mode of & photo album; to turn on the picture you can finish out of the context menu. to finish the Malen, you simply hit the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & popovmodeler, you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not completely control, but the documentation about & Povray; you should absolutely read it and understood it.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is shown in the Drahtar views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple items at the same time. but not the underobject of an already selected object, as all subobjects already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Are there multie possible positions, the following refold-menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on to apply these changes. if you typed unlocked values, a message will be displayed with a troubleshooting. then you can click the input letters to apply again and to apply the changes to disrupting them.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; type of user documentation, you can call the & Povray; reference to the object shown by Help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview of the peculiarity view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press the preview of the character view and a small example of the scene is raged with the chosen texture. when you want to select the whole texture, even if you want a subordinated element (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting. you can change the shift through drag the mouse inside the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visible level of visibility. you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the above-level object or as absolute value. objects will only appear if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the chosen level of visualization of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window mapping as a default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them as desired. you can also save several shutters and simply switch between different versions.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a view, drag the early water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the early water to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then enshrined on the right or left side of this view and covers the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the early water in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the carton top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window of windows are descriptive views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the early water to the desktop or click the small to the left top left arrow in the column bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the column bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the menu View you will find entries for each type of views. new views are silently, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window mapping... store. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene you can renders it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. when this manual was written, 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click on the icon Renders The icon Renate in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to renown a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or select Render modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can type any name, but it is a name that makes the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can enter the width and height of the rounded image. if you want to rename only a small area of the picture, select the ticking section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinational field quality, you can select the properties that are used & Povray. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user's manual on & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is posted with just one beam per pixel, there may be different bugs. these images often have a moirè pattern or piece effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, look better with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because every pixel always gets divided again and adaptive because the recurring pins on the calculations depend.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray will persecuted a Strahl per pixel. if the difference between the shades of pixels with super-sampling is handled. if you adjust the depth to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colors the pre-checked threshold, then the pixels will be checked individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the production of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can adjust whether the alpha channel should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray. if an Povray is terminated, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the menu entry to import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler, not yet the complete command of the VPovray. if the importers error messages or alerts appear, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, please write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object to import text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene rences. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the individual view, opens & kpovmodeler; the property's documentation page is displayed here. place the path to your documentation and the version. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter) in the paths towards the & Povray. if you refer to files that are not included in the folder of the scene, you also need to list the path to those files here. if a file appears in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color will be used for viewing the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle of the view in the camera view and in the window type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Drahtmodel views. you can set the Raster separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a closer wire model and thus a better sewing for the objects shown, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you want to show high detailed projections for extended projections, all wires are advanced in advanced projections. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you indicate a wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you display the floor, a floor is rounded below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantetables, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information regarding the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to change existing window versions or create new window arrangements. in the section window regulations, it is explained how you can create and store windows.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational field Standard shutters: displays all existing window versions. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing shutters displays all existing window versions. a new arrangement can create you with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clearly and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window mapping. new views can create you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, using map card, you get a map display, together with the previous view and webend the view does not fit in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just been installed & Povray; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should read the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">When you insert no light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-assembled window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. thus, you now have a scene without any objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular, you see this in the fourth rohtmodel view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation on & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera in view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the button or press the button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these attitudes. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a quader (insert endent body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a non-concrete method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button or button Enter. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model shows now also shows the level, although at the moment it is limited only as a limited period. if you renders the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can see the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new item: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select the shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box where you can select how the object is inserted. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor-pigment), with a click on the button Preview will see how the pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only displays a matt black material, because you can still specify settings for pigments. therefore always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not preview any color on Quader and Ball, simply click on the button below and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you want to renders your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color list. you are still further settings necessary. in the property list you have to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently but the chess board-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree everytime and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply run this step, since you should have understood the basic functionality of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy as the floor create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for radius: on 1 (do not forget the ball rolling or the button to apply), so the bullet is float above the floor, since you have moved the ground to move down a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put in the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in Ball pigment. click on Ball Pigment, select then monarn and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interestingly effects if you take the time, set some Finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screen photos and click on it or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you're looking for & povmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracer, the renderer derives from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which reflected the scenes) through the objects in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as fog have effects. thus, the scene is adapted for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine you'll see without a camera no, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be raged, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is saved under the same name. is it a new file, you need to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last stored will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry you can only select if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeatedly the last pepper command. this menu entry is only then select if you have used Editors.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodelsets; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool commands with this option tool icons for & cpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to stocro surface finishes without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without change the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes, which you can use as modules: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base, by applying an image file as colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a more comfortable image collection and browser-browser. the application features a file browser in which you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kueshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the & LMBn; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or whether to use all images always the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply tap the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable file name was found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc;</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue Setting - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & ball show; set in the two other, shortwave and short command for the browser, can be set the keyboard shortcut for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the ad space is filled with the background color that you can further down. default mode is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, loads & ball show; already the next image in the folder while you look at the actual picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; in the end up the name of the last opened folder. at the next time the window opens & ball show; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the image is, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can create & cuddshow; to set up that only a few of the file types are displayed that the program can also display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the scoreboard is enlarged to the full screen. this option is enabled as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Notes if the slideshow is supposed to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between the image change in a slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field. default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is cancelled from the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcut for the different modes of operation of & ball show; in the box-cards for the display window and short command for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option you switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolder and a window for the files) and the unfavorable view of the file system with folders and files in a window around.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large symbols for files in the folder. this display is only possible in short description.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard stage. this can be useful for example, to create the different recording of music's and Mp3 collections; without normalize the different accesses of the different albums are to be reproduced in different albums, that the music pieces will vary.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it includes the necessary software to run from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method, recently opened projects again. the related submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry will open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project has already been saved, the previously used file is overwritten, otherwise it is asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog Save As is shown with which you can choose folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all open projects. this is the same as if you would then save for each individual project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project changes and is not saved, asks & K3b; according to what has to happen. you can then set between save and altering changes. also, you can shut down the cord and keep the project opened.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all open-opened projects. & K3b; will ask for any non-stored project, which is supposed to happen, just as if you had called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Includes all open projects and finished & K3b; for each not saved project will be asked what to happen to, as if you had called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you access this entry, you can select the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files appear in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the characteristic dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialog can only open when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described about the What is it? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this is useful when you import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you use files for a multi-meeting CD. this is useful when this function is not used, even if this function is not used, so that you can see the files and folders on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function aims to remove files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this feature does not remove files from the medium, they blends only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">You can also create a CD Copy dialog. alternatively, you can create a CD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also just create a picture of a CD, which you can then burn sometime later. besides, there is also the possibility of craving instead of normal copier. you should prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It also allows copying DVD to a different medium. alternatively, you can also only create a picture of a DVD, which you can then burn sometime later. besides, there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialog yet, the target medium must be big enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can formatting a DVD ± R (W), making the content completely erased. & K3b; lets you choose between the cursor overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously created CD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file using a source of data, which can then immediately be supported by pressing the distillery. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD-image. the dialog asks you to a * .iso file as a source of data that can then be burned down by pressing the distillery.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously illuminated DVD-Video can be converted. this dialog will usually be used after reading a DVD in the table, but can also be used allotable. it contains information about the illuminated video, coding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Shows information about the pickled medium. this information is displayed in the table and include properties of the medium, such as size and titles of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & K3b; if an entry is ticked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is scratched, a small caste at the bottom of the window is displayed. it contains information on the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not intersect, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Enables the folder view, or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is enabled, their content is displayed in the table View. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as Media Info, locking and flaming the running or outlet of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Enables the table view, or out. the table view allows selecting and drag files into the project view. the table view is also the interface for reading audio- or video CDs, provided that a disk with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view was selected.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Turns the headbar in the project view, or out. the headbar is a narrower area that is only visible when the projections has open projects. the headbar has no real function, it looks only pretty, and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to modify the keystrokes for & K3b; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keystrokes to it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; interior assistants. this allows the right permission to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights will need, therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here you can set general arrangements. almost all functions of & K3b; should function on thief. this dialog is intended to personalise and intended for fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is like many other & KDE; applications equipped with a & DCOP; interface equipped with the help of this interface can be controlled by means of functionality via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line utility dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are essentially identical to your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the enclosed programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we take note that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions to be able to make sure you have to make sure that & K3b is started. then enter something like the following on console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions, which have all & KDE; program measured, supported & K3b; mainly two further parts which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Die Standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Copy of the COPProject () DCOPrecreate.MovixCDProject () DCOPrecreateMovixDVDProject () DCOPrecreateMovixCDProject () DCOPrecreate® () void in copy- Cdd () void at the formatDvd () of the formatDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one receives a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: # K3b --audiocd and then you receive a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to alter the project about K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Near createFolder (Qstring name) void void (QString Parent) void with addUrl (QString Parent) at void (QString Path) void (QString Path, QString (name) void (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT C3b K3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createable the foo dcop $PROJECT for / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; -Selleser for & KDE; and with it can be easily stored audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading from & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that support these WAV files (compressed free compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (compressed free compression) are still being installed from the Linux distribution). more coding can be added to the program (if you have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD is read and stored in WAV files on your computer (lost and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Are used in a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG formatted as well as in other formats such as lustless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, is used by & audiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has put together a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you have to be installed (for MP3), oggvoruntil (for OGG) or other encoders. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions already, it's most likely to be necessary for any Linux distributions which are used. if for example FLAC is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? the Chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copying audio CD. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copying. simply avoid the mechanisms of copying audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup is to be done once (the furnishings dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found), the daily handling of a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will frequently stumble in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freeDB on the Internet or can work fully without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB inquiry of the CD data according to the setting up of your request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, the latter case must first be connected to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings in the plug-in settings - encoding settings.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it is to be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the tab code settings in the furnishings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already illuminated file is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and decoding.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, piepsen) for programmer (such as read the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the dialog box dialog from & colaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoders). so, you have to go before the program can successfully be used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right cowarder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost is a lustproof audio format needed. besides FLAC there are also others such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can playback these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, the information caused by data compressed according to their psychoanalytic model, MP3 and OGG, are the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free of charge but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high quality high quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG, slightly deeper quality in deep bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car-stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list with parameters to audio quality and the compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme-B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 tbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older appliances need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable equipment and autoclereals. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without consideration on the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are typed manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freeDB through the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used / paste with an audiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programmes, there is often a combination of program for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders, explain the switches to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch-tt of lame and the title parameter from & audiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -t {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= Knopfalz in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, where people can download the audio CD, the information go up or enter the computer. it is to note that here only by text is said: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberger: this is the author) is not an attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; for more or less worthless, so neither the artist or the music-company can be added any harm. all information can anyway be added at a bummel through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is active to choose an address (send an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address than the specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used by the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if the audiocreator; for use of freeDB is to be used, the geographical line should be used on the next panel. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflection on the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually Monthly created) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that it is cdparanoia used; who wants to know more precisely in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to be aware that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the illuminated WAV files the encoding file can be selected and thus the desired file format is selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lustless compelling for audio data) on the tab for setting the cowarder. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodifier package needs to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for predefined coding. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Worldwide Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodifier, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a counter window (eg; Console). thereby, 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the setup of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copied audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you put writing on it (eg; by trying to copy with the Conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something which is probably done just once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the coding coding to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with, the freeDB to use the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not find them with every reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual equipment designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD Drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here gibts do not have much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only For incomplete information can be requested, so that you will be informed if information is missing to the witnesses of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically download the internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the computer while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry was found immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk. the directory entry or filename can be changed easily. the directory or filename is changed by Conqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3-tag with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter everything manually, then deactivate the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freeDB in the Offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first one. the mode will be arranged on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data on request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server through the Internet. how do the system, which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB servers: please go to Fedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load between the computers is distributed. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, since there are many firewalls affect the protocol of 8880 standards, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit any & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first approach to disable should be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot now. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously outgoing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author does not know it, therefore simply trying themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Record CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to read the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you are specified this indication, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. this can not be useful if only space is created in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is on the screenshot now. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something must be put right down to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'ID3' Tagger for & KDE; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: in a ducore or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to codify more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic establishment of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD. if you chose the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD is described. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB must be described. the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is still not included in freeDB, the screen photos show a little different from the data for a & CD; with successfully passed from freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually insert it from the internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD now needs to be defined in the main window, which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, just as in the screenshot now. this only when the & CD was identified; when audio CD was identified and cdparanoia could be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then you are looking for questions and answers for help or go back to the previous section of the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Warning: if the & CD was successfully transferred from the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are already completed, and the name of the artist and album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which you think is best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the junction for the automatic retrieval of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger this data from selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field of the 'Present title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered into the input field 'actuality title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments iniquile per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freeDB the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you may not only begin with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you are using ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the tab code settings; take a look at the tab code settings.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the files on any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see in the help of the coaster to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which obviously matches the style of the read-on CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the records for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered any title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freeDB Explorer. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the item.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-character before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out. make sure that all the pieces are selected, or click the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection of the reading process, then this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with orders and follow what is going.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching on the order window. it is in the upper left half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen when you are trying to work with a coaster which you have not installed yet. pieces which were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp-file and the target folder are not what we typed here in the example. do you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. to read and code parallel. notice the status message at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration adjustment to press this behavior. the only thing that is configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and coding. at high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous reading and encoding (however, two different pieces of pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodifier. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& mid; is the MIDI- and Karaokgamer of & KDE; besides others he has with real-time graphic and karaoke-real-real highlighting of texts also some properties, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& mid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; support. & mid; also supports the & Linux; ultrassioner project drivers, which is required for CIS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& mid; shows the lyrics text on the screen with changing color, making it simple to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI-channel by highlighting the pressing keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (songs or text events). Kmid will automatically determine the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Sitting support. if you finish & KDE; during playback of a song, KMid starts again with the same song again.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open opening... from the menu File. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also make a file from a & Conqueror; window in the & kmid; window fall. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bed the button to play in the toolbar, select the item you play from the menu or bets the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & mid; one piece will automatically start when you move it to the & mid-mid-window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & mid; one piece plays off, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive over and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tempoindication, and change the playback speed. to get back the original pace, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The spacebar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the spacebar looks like a pressure on the knocking break or selecting the menu entry break in the menu pieces, thus, interrupts the playback. I watch the spacebar while no piece is played, starting & mid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in a music piece. some pieces use Texts, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & mid-mid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, so that you have to set nothing manually. if you have to set the menu settings for Automatic text message. you still have the option to change this when you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a sequence of event, choose from the menu settings the entries text and property events. the same function also have buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are the number to play. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, you first open the collection manager. this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then provide the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the missing pieces in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave this collection, this collection will not be stored. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add. it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding is enabled to collection, a piece of opening (using File Open or drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically Add to Collection is not enabled, opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opening pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click Removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row after the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove or remove an accidental order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song play, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To move a song further, select the button next song, the item next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the button previous piece, the item previous piece from the menu pieces or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection manager and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter as they are saved when leaving & kmid; it is not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which transforms all the events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you don't need a MIDI-map, because all soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS -Cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text-file that saves all required transformations for playback of a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. however, that each occurrence contains a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of the Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A new keyboard... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email, so that I can offer in future versions of & mid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left-hand side of the Equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM will appear in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to place all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a gun (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which include the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (tissues shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is placed in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which every sound represents another percussioner instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the tone-height of the same drum (as it means some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how notes on a particular channel or instrument are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, and their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can set multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the perk channel. see for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, you can easily set it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are usable for keyboards, which have the percussion to a particular channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is pictured on the channel. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used to use the name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, that will change the patch on this channel. in this case a patch has become used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to use the perk-channel patch on the Perkway channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied, in which relation Pitch-bender events are multiplied with the value n, it is activated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to be in the map file not decimal ().</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM prevails that a keyboards will play a sound higher with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & b.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these clots you see which notes are exactly played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer use the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to view the played notes. view the view menu settings below the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece. it includes the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & mid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & mid; that happens because & mid; without the Awe support was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double the arrow keys left from the Tempo- LCD, to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; -desktop space a & Conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; if I want to play a MIDI file or I would like to play a file, just change the & Conqueror; window change and drag the file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file fast without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic adding to collection, and the new; file is added to temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. only just want to play the first file. so make your setup automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly that a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join in to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I animate myself to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& Dimid, was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I'm written in the third year, so I do not take much time for my hobbies, but I am trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies. as hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, making music and prove it.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & mid; or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You truly make me a huge surprise when you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file. before you want to send a MIDI file, but you should contact me as I maybe have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't miss anything about it. I want to stress that I only get more programmable because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this one can also be found at its homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can watch the development and look for pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends much on your soundcard. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & b; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you'd like to hear a soundcard, except that you cannot listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from so-called flowerable windows. there is always the window with the central view. either there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is repeated in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to storing the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played according to each other, so you should use the category Dauerhaus playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hierarchiestufe. if you ancakes an entry, his group and all its subcategories are copied to the current category and playback with the desired entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and thumbnails can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, one can only do if you click on a category of ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer /, you can simply click on a name of a category button to choose from the menu View and next editing mode. due to the clipping of a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlists and either selected by the default mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the workstation will leave, or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on through changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable other animation to enable the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / play.xml and ~ / .kde / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during stopping doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be disruptive at the end-animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilds; & lt; IMG Dur = "inject" src = "inlets; & lt; / smilds; As a source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here the path can be adjusted from the Mplayer and the memory size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaycc, as the setup of the backend per mimic ype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is used:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within and kmplayer; even the special field Embed can be inserted for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & b player; 'flash' in HTML pages can reproduce, the & kmplayer; module serves as service providers for the MIME-Type S / x-Shockwave flash in the furnishings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror & Restaurant; is to browse in a consoles application and search for error regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend issue is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">With this always a given backend for a particular MIME type is taken (of course only once this was determined), this must be done by manual anxiety of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon should reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& T player; can be used by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner is used to be used and the configuration file can be configured manually or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog is detected in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected from which one selected coding must be found out (e.g., it PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR can use support from kmplayer only Xvideo (probably this type of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one working). this is why the videoforlinux extension must be functioning properly for the X server. for the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>

<seg id="1731">Are there hints as I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is available as a user root after connecting the device. this is absolutely sure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1753">The fast-entry assistant of & kile; is a teeter feature for quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (Mens) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document. it can also be applied to some of the related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is hereby the type of the document using: article (items), book [abstract], book (DIN) [scrapprt], book (DIN) [scrapprt], book (DIN) [scrapprt], book (DIN) [scrapprt], films [prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: hereby the codification of the system is set. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as default. at best, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source code editors, the highlighting of used commands, attitudes and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & kile; it is very easy to remember that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is determined by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you by the highlighting time and while sirable.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic conversion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ v {command}) of & kile; automatically create a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line to the string of the command (e.g.\\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the menu settings; setup... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; the subdivision of the document in the following items (part is the most common and subsistence the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the Structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse-click on the device.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful, as soon as a DVI; -file has been created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF the current output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, conversion and to print DVI; files for different systems and sizes.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the kitchen search, the elements of the DVI; -file with the Editor is hatched and once placed on an element in the DVI; -source code has been clicked on, becomes the exact opposite of it. once on a section in & latex; source code was clicked, becomes the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer gestions.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a Master document the work with others integrated .tex files will be simplified. when using a project a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-making: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source text).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File recovery: in this mode, the DVI; -file on Ã ¼ nderungenâ, selector, and it is not a call from & ocular; according to the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When considering the editing tool, the three rough fields are marked. the selection fields were designed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick structuring of the document in parts, sections, sections,... The inappropriate & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box prints are for example of articles such as keywords, fugue, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section is created, an image or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for the reference to a fixed name (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary translations; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & bbibtex; and & b bibtex; and the & bibtex; files can be found naturally also in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selffield with the name of gray is used for determining the font. it can be used to define the fonts for the main text, the joints, etc., there are the following lettering:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling for & kile; there are two choices for installation: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and stacking the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. the settings [12pt] establishes the fonts. the font is not fixed at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was typed, the & latex; source code is compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the Mens Building or the button of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & kile; the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Slats the compiling of the document fails, should be searched in the logging in accordance with the errors. if use of quick-construction should be started. if use of quick-construction should be started. if this is not the case, should also be observed if the protocol should be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document, for example, a report with the font should have a different writing. then the command\\ begin {Environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {Environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The injections are only available within the area (from\\ words {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no lettering (number) for ordering within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to enlighten the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, liabilities, submissions, submissions, etc. add these commands either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is long until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ benh {word} cursive.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Percentage: creates a quotation in the document. the quotation starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; label language was shown, now follows a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit text was typed, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be accomplished. there should be mind. a quotation, a few positions in the liposh and course of course and a poem to apply to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, it can be returned to the editor using the editor-view or Ctrl (in the internal observer). with an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a linear file format (engl. D e V ice I noses). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer are created. there are many different types of the .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer figurines.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the print of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document using a file print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar light creates the transformation of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; -file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into slightly different formats can start using the knobs in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prepuzziness search the direct jump from the editor to an associated position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; it offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binder files. for this purpose, only Modern among settings Kile set up... tools can be washed out.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To look for the preferential search, the mouse pointer is positioned in a line of the source text and ended upon preliminary search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocular, with a click of middle mouse button on the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; document of & kile; must be set in & ocular; in & ocular; in & ocular; as a text editor, are set (settings ocular setup... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the turn of quick-making of the & DVI; -viewer not, can be a mistake. should be a mistake, this is displayed in the log file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the error source in the source code. the log file always can be used between the errors. the log file appears on the line where the error appears. to view the faulty line, it must be clicked on the bug in the logging file and kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the possibilities presented are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">In selecting an empty document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document. for more information, this document is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be found in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file accessed, or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template using the template to create an existing document and selection of file template from the document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using the new file, some strings are replaced by other data (such as name or drawing). these variables can be set up in settings Kile setup... settings General are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used by entering in documentation class. typically they will be used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and that enables you to use the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can be chosen instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. becomes a simple way for creating a template, should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and highlighting of many different types of text (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be found in the MenÃ ¼ Tools right out of & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its features should be experienced the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can place there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of & Kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called the Mens help LaTeX reference. it included a detailed description nearly all commands, which can be found in & latex; usage can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with drunken Strg button to wander the & tex; that means that in this way by clicking on\\ par from\\ par\\\ refer to only\\ par excellence.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with the left mouse button, the text-turned text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons, you can choose parts of the source text in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the opportunity to browse the most varied types of source texts and to emphasise it. for example, the & latex; commands of normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants have a very own type of bookmarks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. this jumping brand is highlighted, so that it is also highlighted in the first input of a drawing.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; even though & Kate; already outstanding features are added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source texts, always add many environments and groups and therefore support; special commands for their selection. under Editions are the following commands to choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Wells a complete paragraph (group of lines that included on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph there is not a text with all tables (like in other text ditors). these advanced meaning close to tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of source texts. the only negative thing in & kile; is thereby that the waste streams separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also & latex; commands with an Ã ¼ rich star (*) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For viewing a part of the document, of course, it is possible to pick out this first and by Drying of the button. & Kate; offers the keypad Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands, for a faster delivery. under editing are the following commands to read the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of processing covers.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already clarifies that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore it offers & kile; for further commands in the editing area for an extremely simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command it will move to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the command to serve the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will move towards the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the command to the rear of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ 'command\\' command}, it is placed at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of wasted ambient commands can be quickly the while remaining. this command was close the most recently designed environment, so that the snowed ambient structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands to suit those from their own.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly clamp clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command it will move towards the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the curly checked clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the curly clamp of a & tex; -group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many bolts-brushed groups-brackets can quickly get lost the time view. this command was close the last group, so that the spletelte structure of the & tex; -groups are not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple attachment marks are used in & kile; the sign "for two simple angling signs are used. and kile; the sign is used for two simple lines. & kile; knows this case and for two sleeping-suited sign for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic adjustment of the double attachment can be set under settings Kile... LaTeX and will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to use specific settings (such as German or French), and therefore German or French versions. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">At the Drinking of Shift; Rhinopetaste hides. if the current position is located inside a lists environment (such as enumerate or itemize). if the current position inside a lists (such as enumerate or itemize) is located, for example, but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a table environment, close the & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an inject Zeilennia.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-presented & latex; - or custom-defined environments. these can be found under settings kile; set up in LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users present the columns in tables designs and thereby all the Et-characters (amp;) each with each other. & kile; tries to place this. although this Tabulator is not the appr. even though this Tabulator is not the appr. even though this tabulator is not the appr; some intermediate space for the columns of the current tabs.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already provides a good source code, this in & kile; for special commands (usually available for llatex;) there are three according to demand and the other two are for automatic replaceable. all these modes can be set up for different workings under settings Kile set up...</seg>
<seg id="1839">Starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {surroundings}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When flying the RÃ ¼ ckdown the last letter of the input is removed and allows you to extend the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from & kile; alternatively, jumping brands are frozen, so that an easy jump to these positions by editing at the NÃ ¤chste jumping brand can be found and the desired parameters can then be found.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; set up... kile; generously can be made of settings to these lists. you can choose different wraps for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as winding, are washed by the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the utilization of environments not weekly. it has always been typed a few letters with\\ 'begin typing. on the other hand, the environments will often be used so often that & kile; a special mode for the utilization of the environments to supply.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling for the full-operation mode, the menu is automatically absorbed in the surrounding area or the keyboard shortcut of the environment and it appears\\ begin}. after that, the ambient noise will continue in the simplest way and can be completed by the sending of the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the surroundings will automatically be closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a lists of environment, even a first\\ item item is still covered.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; set up... kile; generously can be done settings to these lists. this mode uses the wallet list of the complete mode for etex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supported user-defined lists of covers, which are immediately replaced by LÃ ¤nler strings. the lists can be found under settings Kile... Kile Vermixes, in which example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word glazed mode used the menue Ctrl + Alt whitebar, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Rough waits are not helpful for automatic generalizations. however, it has been determined that many may be written in a document more than once. thus, it offers & kile; the amusement park is already written for everyone already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menu settings Kile...</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent base for browsing and rences of pages. the PDF output will be created, so you can reinstall the pages with a few & PostScript; -tools newly arranged and then be converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to take care of the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all the tools are grouped in the quantity to create compiling, creating transformations and creation.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source text for viewers such as & ocular; or another conversion may be used by the keyboard, using the Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and be viewed by old; 5 the PS file is viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command's Quick Construction is normally a spectator called after the compiling. should not be used, any inundeserved viewer will be used every time a new window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project of New project.... the following information is asked for the project:</seg>

<seg id="2039">Once a workload is added, you need to add and configure your actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add them to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the tag attributes, and you plan their use, activate a dialog "day process," when available to enter the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Iging! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & menu;, graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have decided to create a startbutton as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must still be associated with action. this happens through the menu with settings promotions... (in & quantapses;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the use button and continue using other tags, so there are or confirm with the OK button to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantapings; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared with a better overview by some Trenner into multiple groups. make sure to set the toolbar on settings toolbar. make sure that the toolbar desired is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (completely left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I like for example a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separators support grouping. anyone who does not know my work toolbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start-buttones be.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested through testing of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be imbal folders, but your workpieces should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar can be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mention value of & quake; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting address you like most. therefore, this chapter discusses how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be in & squeezed; check out if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will leave you, the second, we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir. section 1 = Section1.html = Securehtml Sec2.2 = Sectionhtml Sec2.2 = Section1.html = Securehtml Sec2.2 = Section1.html = Securehtml Sec2.2 = Section1.html 2 = func1.html pages 2 = functionally tag1 = tag1.html Day 2 = tag3.html 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation is something like that:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # on Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for chess boards (except for reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequent at the top end of the front view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Whitespace influence nothing, but pay attention to & and lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantapSaul; Resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content-section is the range of the docrc file which is intended to display the context-text sensitive support. for example, when writing a function name and Dining of Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of concoded text elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure this good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation have been used to the & quantapSaul; -Repository for the use by the & quake; -communion. you will not become rich, but proud to have worked on the best weaving platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quake; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separators (DTEP packages, workpieces with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise to whom. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD-package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantapses; users can download them. the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication. to make use of an easy contribution, what it guarantees a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">While uploading you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can have a look. in the dialog New resource you have to stay out (URL Preview can remain empty) and then hit the high load of the high load.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload of the menus DTD DTD-package (DTEP), and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installing, investigating & quantapses; the integrity of the resource by verification of integrity and signature. in case of problems warns it and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not created by & quantapSaul. the creation may be prompt, because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in day-to-day XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string that appear in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / W3C / / EN HTTP / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / proje.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & squeezed; after conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & squeezed; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and make full benefit from & quantapults, one has to first become familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantings; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quake; the employment area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone, the & quantapons; uses, available. from workpieces about actions is everything that is marked as globally, in the joint folder structure of & quantapults; it enables the group of administrators from different workpieces, actions and patterns in the global tree to be available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user index, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to workpieces with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emöglicht.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantapSaul; MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building control, the manoeuvre with information and the toolbar. please refer to and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document messages, re-load, deleted or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), processing the cursor on the mouse, help to the word under the pointer of mouse or opening the file when the string are referred to a file under the pointer of mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor there are the workpieces of the editor. currently, & quantapses; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of workpieces will be shown. as part of the further expansion of workpieces, the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of workpieces is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; in her document, then click on the icon that has represented the day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day (such as Anchor), you can paste into a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The constructions (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quake; to navigate, they open and roaming. in the display with cartes stand for files, project, sample structure, scripts, attributes, and documentation components are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, the & quake; provides. this view shows all the files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by means of right mouse-click. actions such as adding, removal, uploading, or deletion of files from storage media can be performed with the context menu shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quake; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category is always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. the right mouse button are available for example, such as the script to boot, edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-click of an element, the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element. through the right-click of an element, it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other components. with it can change some quickly attributes and namespace. this applies to the contents of the contract and allows modification of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development. you can create pre-packed documentation for & quantapults; from the quake; 'documentations site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantapses; two tabs at the bottom of the window, using the beneficial information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton displays information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the follow-up of the current document. & quantapSaul; scripts that will be executed, give all the error messages (so there are those) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantapses; workpieces are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Chocolates of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantapSaul; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantapSaul; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can save them in & quantapults: like any other, backup and recharge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantapses; files on your system. therefore, autoconf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and are not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantapults, you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that is not an older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder. the same holds for & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& squeezed; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantapSaul; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the endeavor to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers began to deal with an obvious idea, what would be if & quantapSaul; an independent, extensible Markup language editor would be? well, this would make him absolutely greatest web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on reines & HTML; limited, is & quantapie; now it is far on its way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then the appropriate & IDE; be the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim has to be held that & quake; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; Developers community. & quantapSaul; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why developed? thanks to the & KDE; -Scaffolds is not only all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantapSaul. to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quake; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-coated actions, scripts and toolbar, automation is almost every task possible. by the program Combo, they can expand & quantapSaul. (read more about it here.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast Webdesign and has quickly expanded to an mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developer left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More to the details of the documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Conqueror; enter or khelpdesk help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick-hand list of files you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template, will only be an error.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting the clipboard there provided special characters to the & HTML; -notation, so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -notation which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Select the blockers in or out. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a number number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages can be out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions in order to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window to or not to. that's the window in which you see the display of script and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and intimidation of the problem-porters at the bottom of the & quantapSaul; main window reporter is activated once you change to the structural base.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark from other opened documents will appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantapSaul; projects are stored with the file name .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory after new files that could be there. it enables e.g. to copy graphics files into your project level or subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output module (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantapSaul; the project manages. in Chapter & quantapSaul; projects can be explained to the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">It loads a toolbar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only stored in this menu when you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates just the name. actions must save actions by means of settings can be saved. workpieces will be saved via the toolbar and you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a toolbar from the field of view. that does not deletes it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantapSaul; team so that the toolbar can be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message using the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the high load of workpieces on the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that has made you or anyone else and convert into the & quantapSaul; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh of the entities from the & DTD; is sensible if the entities should be out of the & DTEP; to renew, without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a typing in the global KDE folder does not exist, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags, which are available in the currently uploaded workpieces. if the default (HTML;) toolbar can be loaded, there is a submenu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quake; the insertion by means of a toolbar, when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plugins are listed under the listed menu items. click on them. click on a activated plugin deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syndropping mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on derkate; version AB.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people, the other OS platforms to the developer. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of interface. by some limitations in KDE libraries can cause the switching sometimes time or unnice graphics. recommended is the cartographic mode, which is also the default mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantapSaul; 3.2 and sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2148">Additionally this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. with a selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantapSaul; main window at or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog box every application that use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; -WebBrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Complies with the behavior of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "a dialogue will appear where you can delete entries from the toolbar or change them and follow the sequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create assistance in accordance with the environment of the mouse button, but it is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& squeezed; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantapSaul; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom, since for example after receiving the project name the whole directory structure will be completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later on Shift; F7 project project properties are set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quake; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access one, except to edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary) or an IP-address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets you empty this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol may be used. depending on the setting of the remote computer you might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or entire folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static weaving you want to download and change. if you add-to script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Accused, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, should not be mounted somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is begun to start anew, not anhook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick, pegs from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Assistant includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload in menu with project properties in the menu window or to be modified using the shortcut shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the extra entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (Placeholder can be ignored) which will reread about project-related operations such as projections.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project. it can be read more about Project perspectives.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The desired debugger can be selected. at present, only Gubed can be supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, uploading profiles can be set (see in), as well as the display of a building management for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-Window Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the bottom window configuration, one can switch event actions and add these actions, change or delete these actions when a previous event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see into the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quake; the last project that was open. this behavior can not currently affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select the project... from the menu project or icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects will have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quake; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantapSaul; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but missing the entries will be opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here can be selected different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more a profile exists, the button will disend to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel storage and for appointments. this possibility is useful when common uploading files is needed and the rather uncertain password on the plate is not coming into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantapSaul; many skyscrapers are created and thus can be uploaded to different servers, editing the project (or part of the project). when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>

<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and workpieces. it can be loaded in a project a lot of views, i.e. through simple scanners the view can be loaded various files and toolbar and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the menu on the project or the project workshop, can be opened or deleted from the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quake; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of & quake; to their own working practices.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are workpieces in & quantapSaul. best above the menu toolbar. use and adding are distinguishable. the adding of workpieces will be treated at the bottom in the adding of workpieces.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New action, a new toolbar can be executed, as stated in dialogue, where actions can be seen on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and the action will be displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings toolbar... and settings promotions are set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentation, code-cutlets and files for the linkage. & quantapses; used templates basically like a common filesystem with expanded organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or any place to the system existing directory in the template. templates have in & quantapSaul; in about the limitations one can imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quake; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the padlock under global templates. more information on the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents can be found in appropriate subfolders. usually, some examples can be found in corresponding subfolders. some examples can be found in the template-tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text range always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the template-tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantapSaul.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn up with drag and attach to the modular-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only available in an integer folder. it can be used for all file management functions so as to drag and insert or paste via the file tree of Conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on the file tree or in the project files building to create a folder on the right and backup website template, but by default, it can be saved in the project level, but of course it can be used as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can design headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; design, inserting files or connect them with them. additionally, you can keep some things in touch with templates in projects very profound.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantapSaul; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Editor-Editor, which covers the menu View. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; Editor and the Zweite shares the Editor window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor where the changes made in VPL; Editor in source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this direct with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Editor to edit it is still the source code editor necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time changes both in the source code editor and in the VPL; Editor synchronous is already active, this mode is already active, puts the key pressure from one window to the other, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The sync distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta. you can choose between synchronization according to a click or automatically select. by selecting automatically the time span can be set. basically, the recommendation is: a small spanne for quick calculators and a large spanne for slow-slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing features is possible to choose, so the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; -Editor is also called once a new document with the VPL; -editor will also be created. this serves the reduction of the suspension code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords available for internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows modification of the content, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons below the list or delete it. a change over the list is exactly as with the meta-elements possible. editing of CSS-rules is currently not yet supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style system by pressing the file-button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text processing, possible by planting with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and by typing or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor, made. it is to be observed that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag will be inserted with text, every other round anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some workpieces like the tables or the lists-assistant are disabled. they will be later used in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists of workpieces must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & Dediff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The interplay was very complicated because one of the contributors had changed many changes and at the same time had been corrected with many places in the same file. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the flaws had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & Dediff3; there could be differences in one row and changes to white signs. later, a lot of more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function changed & diffuse; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3 ways conveying is fully supported. this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot show three quell files in the merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Dediff3; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screen shot shows & diffuse 3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Dediff3; displays the exact differences and serve them in the possibilities of heubish huore. if you need to check code often, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no hassle, if someone and the opulation changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is the same, and the other differs in a line then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily write the Tipat work by completely copy the filename of the first file completely. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Dediff3 folder 1 folder Dziner.Folder 2 folder Dediff3 folder Dfolder 2 folder Dfolder 2 folder Dfolder 2 folder and folder 2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening-dialog allows the manual type of filename, the selection over the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the list box. you don't need to specify a third file; if you have to empty the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the conical or merging of folders will be introduced. however, if for A file is selected, for B and C a folder then uses & diffuse; the filename from A in the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge is active, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can get this step later on when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before you start with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & Dediff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in opening dialog you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel 'button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop it: drag one file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is it? sometimes, a file contains such a number of similar functions. if you like to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would have to load only two corresponding files to simply copy them in & diffuse. now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply copy, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: right now you can choose nothing from & diffuse; only the case run by text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and insert text into another program as excerpts and inserting (instead of copying and insertion). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window the info section of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each pointer has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while over the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these curtains can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees on the color that distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is different for red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is easy to see in the next section (merger).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarised column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and reviews, for the preprocessor and in few, rare items.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summarizing column from the text is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines, the line is pictured on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparisons) also has a info line with the wording issue:, the filename and [changed] when you edited the result. usually, it contains the automatic merge already text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the saving is downlighted!!! (use the buttons jump to the most severe / unged conflict to find the still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference simultaneously has to be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line belonging group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear. (this will also be visible the current group.) This group will then highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each appears on the left a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic merge or by manual editing no more line is left in the group; then this text is displayed in the quelds; it's only a space-card for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarizing; however, appears in the clipboard; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function around.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly used with the mouse-run and the mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side, side, end, Strg-Start and Strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the overflow column next to the vertical scroll bar can also be used to Navigate into the Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auforefenster you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the inserting button, you can switch between insertion and overhaul mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarize columns in view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as already in the section summarised and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict (roadmap) to the next / previous conflict (roadmap) or to the next / previous conflict (roadmap) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-Picture) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, must be regarded as conflict between solved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl + insert). however, this option will automatically copy you automatically into the clipboard and manually copy the manual copy. be with this option but careful, because you might be able to overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line-in sign\, and Win32-based systems use towing + Zeilenvorb\\ r\. Kdiffusion 3 retains the transmission of source files, therefore you should use & diffuse 3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of files recently used will be automatically saved and restored at the next start. (menu Instellations- &gt; Kdiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue also displays writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are shown in recursive font. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing does not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be lasted. on these systems the button preferences automatically displays an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabs button. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or return return, the emitting of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied into the clipboard. the manual is copied into the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files tries & diffuse 3; first, all completely identical lines to be found in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step white signs will not be ignored. also, while intering, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car knobs'\ 'at the end of a line, others are simply ignored and diffuse. if this option is enabled, it will be treated differently. if this option is activated, it will be deactivated with different sizes on the side-on page, but as a white sign be treated. during the crash, this option must be deactivated. in default, this is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis the figures and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The auto-shift mode determines this setting, as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Eliminates automatically all conflicts in white signs using the selected file being used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files. please note that the automatic selection can also be traced in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and transmissions. check for details under documentation to directory comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version is the Suffix .orig is attached. if already such a backupfile exists with the Suffix .orig, this will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the interface. changing this option affects not the currently running program. you need to finish line diffuse. (this option is available in the KDE version of & Mardiff3; not available because the language is employed globally on the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it is used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection areas for coding appears a quick note that is the local encoding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file code for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting interpreting for each file individually, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding should be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they could possibly not function with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit ASCII, but the pre-processing command can only be with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of previous processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress of changes in white characters in the text or viewing column. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. however, sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. depending on selecting A & lt; B, A & B; -ds; C or B & lt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second overflow column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. blending the less important windows. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparisons side by side or to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts to merge the merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-assembled name for output file. (if this function is used to launch the merge again, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first pass on to this external command. in & Dediff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut down parts or to correct the recess.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the tick. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to enable the user to give more flexibility in setting the Diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program this. the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for twaddle to transform the input into big letters: sed 's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 2 /'. the\\ 1 in the executable string refers to the found text in the first Klammernfew. the\\ U turns the found text into big letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Using CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert character chains (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword _ header\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _ URL\\ _ BAR _</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you might recognize these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for Zeilses. sed '/ [0123456789.-] / / g' Each character between '[' and ']' is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several compositions up once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different like Z. B. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / counter' allergen are in perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) need perl only (and) without the leading '\\'. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and assembling. further operations change only the data, which of the line-hgorythm can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line processor has seen the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit multiple files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & diffuse; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without being able to perform</seg>
<seg id="2364">... introduces selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and conveying of individual files. you only need to open a folder on the command line or the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three files are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, uses & diffuse 3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start the merging. to launch the merge, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (more details follow).</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will be informed a little message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to that date.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, displays & diffuse 3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can double clicking on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories craps and all subdirectories craps up with which you can use all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will start immediately and it appears as a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailled window to the selected object. in such a case, the assembler action can not be automatically chosen. if the merging is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, you will be used in the columns A / B / C colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if its entire content is identical. then also folder are the same color. in folders the age is immaterial for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf back, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (such as A folder and B a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects can exist, the merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (such as A folder and B a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects can exist, the merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to sync is active, if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories are synchronised, then select & diffuse; the necessary action to look after both files are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; directly after the conduction copied & diffuse 3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and select the option of new file instead of merging (unsafe), then examine an error message: files are different, but the date is identical.. If such errors are not removed, the merging of the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the crash, one file is processed after the other. you status column shows skills when the conveying was successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpectedly entered, you should make a last check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the furnishings dialog the file comparative method is selected, will display the number of formwork, deleted, not whiter and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected item (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all together-up actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any destination folder, then in the three-folder crash mode, B can be used as a target and used to synchronize A and / or B as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries may be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only execute the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to conflicting file types still exist, a message appears on the faulty elements appear. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options flow, simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you want to see what will happen without which really changes will be made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& Dediff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge-window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again directories and continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, an appropriate dialogue will appear. then results and diffuse 3; his work with the next record continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diffuse, you will find a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will find some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem (F7 key), allows you to try to select the cause of the problem (F7 button), allows you to select the problem again or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If a number of entries have been individually merged, these entries (in the current session) will not be together again. even if the merger has been transferred or not saved, these entries will be considered settled. only if you change the merger action, these entries will be re-merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & Dediff3; (Settings Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory contraction with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element-tree. you can separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (such as * .cpp; * .h). the default file must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders match this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern; use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders match this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern; use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a single attribute. in other filesystems marked a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folder: when the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that a link to a folder of a link can lead to a loop loop and & diffuse 3; crashes.) This option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executing a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics column. (the number of Delete, Comforter and white conflicts.) The whole analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when used on files that contain no text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size. however, this speed costs will cost you a certain level of safety. please use caution. this option is connected with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly as familiar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful for example if when copying the change of time. please use caution. this option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the sync mode if two files are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals to merge together are identical. also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of the merging the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, because it's the knowledge that the other file has not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and gets deleted. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of files, not just the merging of entire files. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the directory assembler view can be visible to the merging of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views through the window & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, you can also run a single file directly from the merging menu. once you save the result, the status will be completed and the file will not be merged once you start the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will however be lost if you read the directory again: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KUP 3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive containing a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. that is with URLs not possible, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masonry. (# - &gt;% 23, blank spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays. then always a file is assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note the option confidential the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose-purpose is currently as differences of spectator in pordeop. KDevelop initially starts the built-in differences viewer. to start the mouse button, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part, from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & diffuse; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a cunt, the input file holds a patch file in the Unified format. then detects & diffuse; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start-diff3; the patch will recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kdiffusion 3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. moreover, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If it is executed as a part, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the comparing of folders will not support in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heist's compare) are already available. moreover, the name Kdiffusion 3 already indicates that it can lead together as the program diffuse from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs already very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to be so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script probably not the right prefix to KDE. in the default installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines will be treated as identical; but if only a non-white sign is treated differently, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this dois, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is simply lost when the result is stored easily as a text file and it's much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too large. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be used by another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src lints; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Dediff3; already uses many colors to elaborate preference. even more highlighting would be confusingly and misses the purpose. do not use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & Dediff3; take advantage of it, you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & diffuse 3; on a system with & KDE; compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of the & diffuse 3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & Dediff3; autobahn and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. nevertheless, difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut off (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current market.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders and appear not in the folder structure, and consequently do not appear in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to reread changes to these options to the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will only show records that have differences. that also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder. if the target folder of these files does not already contain, they are missing in a later program version likely to change.) This option is switched on in a later program version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in result window (if they are not already present), if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. underground differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & pager; shows a thumbnails of all virtual workspaces. it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the field of work, to change their size, to quit them or to postpone it. this works both within a workspace and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & pager; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications on display. applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows inside & pager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other areas of work.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & cashager, the context menu has just been clicked on an application within & kpager; however, the context menu is clicked on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, on desktop and responds. commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to select virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this approach is marked, you can switch windows inside the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces are moved.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is scratched, the name of the virtual desktop is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & kpager; the numbers of virtual workspaces show; it is together with name displayed, the names are equipped with OrdinalPay, & eg. 1. working space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is intersect, the background of each workspace is also displayed as background in the & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is intersect, the running programs are displayed as a small window in the & pager; otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & pager will be determined: classic leaves and kpager; in a 2xn crater appear, as made out of Pager applications in some other Windowmanes; horizontally, all virtual workspaces in a horizontal and perpendicular in a vertical row, which is very suitable for the presentation lateral on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Plus ager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, the windows as symbols or with their content can be displayed and moved. furthermore, it works outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button inside of & pager; and following setting the switch set up... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment it is not possible to change the dialog's settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or VII. if you do not have a typed to the file, you must log in as a user root or register to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowtransparentmode and assign values to this. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, as soon as the mouse-cursor is harmed for a while on the same place. it is meant to help people who are suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse-click pain is prepared. however, it may require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; may handle the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from the mere conception of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps prevent when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that can be caused by typing the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can affect anyone differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse-click when you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause, after it's the move of mouse button. move the mouse, it waits until the end of the movement, before the slogan of the mouse button will run. this way you can push the drag and drop a little practice, but you get used quickly it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This devastation period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; one mouse-click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smart relocating switched on, the filming of shooting (1 / 10 s) is active. here is the time set, the & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button waits before it leaves the mouse button again, if in the meantime no limitations takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow return to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE; to do this move the & controlcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, the kmousetool is started; with every start of & KDE; started. this feature is currently only available under & KDE; available on GNOME or other window environments, please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings back on the values that have been configured when opening the dialog. have already pushed the button, the settings will be applied to the stand after the last stop of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best you use & kmousetool; initially with the presets. in particular the intelligent duplication, you should first be switched off at first. if you then click on the automatic mouse click to get used later you can get the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the responses of & KDE; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows, or on places in the browser window that does not represent a link, does not lead to unaware reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse ruined, you should cleanse your mouse. that's usually rather simple. the trick is that you can not only cleanse the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse ball. as that happens, from mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scraped with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started an accident resulting in this case, that means that & kmousetool is that the operation can no longer stop by the slogan of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself a mouse-click. thus, the status of & kmousetool will perform, and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor on the cursor, where you want to place it. however, you can give your mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you're feeling a keystroke. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are unrepeatable reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are unused; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it into the clipboard and paste it back into the clipboard or execute any other action you want to move the mouse on pressing mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">If you do not use the intelligent duplication, if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. select Text instead holding a mouse button down and hold the Shift key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and move the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this becomes every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when in the smartly moving the shoot is beginning. later, you can use the intelligent duplication even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use that the XTest extension for & X Window; installed. this should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a soundcard and speaker and these are furnished correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; betrotates the mouse button once the mouse-cursor shortly. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and which the bed of the motive pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain period of time waiting that a pulling action begins, before the mouse button is left. in this way can also drag the drag and place with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal working with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text appears before he is sent to the program Speech-Dispatcher. they are useful for improving the language to select wrong words or abbreviations, or to select a suitable language and speaker, or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working practices of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech-Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs from four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen checks has the highest priority. it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps those orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the aforementioned orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is too hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the highest priority. a message underbreaks normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you can read a long text on a website, you can enter with & mouth; someone who just enter the room. & KDE; messages are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each job you encounter from the card ticket orders is a text contract. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text entries. text files are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen revisions. if an application sends the output of a screen readers, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen playback. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & KDE; News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Schemketteners replace parts of a text by other text. the placeable parts can provide you either as words or as a regular expressions, which enable the setting of chat-motifs such as: -) by text or for the reformatting of messages from & Conversation; or & mail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; formers use a XSLT-file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in delivery of & ktts; some XSLT-files are included for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker adapters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts. if you have sent a female voice on the map card, you can read text from KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has selectable rules, after which he is applied to a voice default. if the filter does not indicate that his rules cannot apply, the text gives the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text contract, a message, warning or a & KDE; alerts on & ktts; be sent, it is processed by all the activated filters made on the page below. the processing by the filters are processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. is a filter not scaled, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed the row from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will display the following layout dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up strings, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern. those patterns in the text are found, then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding subcode. large and small-case is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filters. this name can be chosen arbitrarily, he only needs to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column accordance and replace it in accordance with the string. the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regulars from a file that save the current list or delete a list from a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only used when the speaker refers to the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click with the mouse-click the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, mail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application id running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & DBus; numbers, you have to weave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only be copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string composition filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the casted filter are applied if the filters are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the string regularity measure regular expressions in the form\\ s Word\\. the words must therefore be limited by partitions (space) both.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular expressions are available in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the ambient variable PATH, is also xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker option filter, you can send texts to a certain speaker, which is arranged on the carton speaker, or to a speaker with certain properties. you can for example specify that texts by mail from a female voice should be read. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed on the filters, there is a spokesman for the text. the speaker is presented by the speaker's characteristics which the program predictates the text to & ktts; sent the speaker's properties on the card speaker. with the speaker option, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered, the filter is applied if the text contains the executing regular expression. is on your system of the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular Payments installed, you can call this with one click on the button to receive help in input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., begin the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place here the characteristics of the requested speaker firm. if the text meets the above filter conditions, the speaker is selected, which corresponds to the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to view the dialog language selection.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; use, check first whether specech-dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. then you can use the shell script with SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that is the first version of Speech-Dispatcher. the program ttmsgr should be developed so further that the establishment of Speech-Dispatcher is directly accessible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDS filter).

<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as an ordinance of the form of proposition. you can change its settings, or add more propositional filters, but it will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to try out the speaker selection. turn on the card down, which speaker & ktts; choose some of the attributes and check how the choice of the spokesperson is changed. of course, you must of course have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with reading can begin as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform, integrated surface. the & controlcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & nnetworkconf; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, such as other settings from the & controlcenter; to allow the user to create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module can be displayed in & controlcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in & menu-menu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured to configure & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and the adjustment of the network features enables.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing & Linux; with installed and set up. network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded through adaptation of the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings will be loaded, if the option is selected in the & controlcenter; index is selected. when starting the module settings, this, the platform used by the system is automatically recognized.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the hanging selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best suited. by flagging the setting Not-again query, the definition can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of the network settings is only possible in system administration mode. previously, all options are shown gray, which means, the settings can only be considered, the changing mode is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can access the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The defined network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button set up... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button below shows dialogue with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP settings fetched by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are carried out at the same time using the start of system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information on each system start, therefore no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, are selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manuals can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP-configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask is the backing mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initializes the network interface at the boats. if the initialization is not desirable, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or activated, depending on the need, and turn off on the switched network. it takes place by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or deactivated, depending on the need, and turn off of a activated network. it takes place by selecting from the list and setting up of the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2819">If the computer is available more than a network interface, the interface has to be selected to the network, where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine is http: / / www.inedomain.org, it dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine to the namachment part of the equator solution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered den.DNS entries can be arranged through selection of an order and up-up or downgradation in the list with the buttons or can be ordered in top priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to the namestion solution, a DNS server can add a DNS server. it will be added to the dialog's New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2825">The list specifically known machine describes calculating IP address references for TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by boat if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains name as well known computers, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. still, in the test, the version of IP is to be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The dialog new alias will be added.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as paste or the installation tool of your distribution may be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & Qunetworkconf; the following commands should achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, in the second, all of the configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix will only provide basic information about the involvement of the PC in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated by TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large spread. by IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future. this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP address is a network interface. in foreign networks, at the & eg workplace, the network administrator is the contact point, which is a valid IP address or, if available, can be used to DHCP. definitely the IP address can not be chosen as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular for that purpose to avoid IP address connections with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses in the field of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the two-line address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 has been assigned to a one-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part the configuration files that are affected by & cnetworkconf: and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections, so that it is no surprise if in case of active DSL connections to a different content than fixed there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& soldier; is a backup programme for band drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar that presented the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective exiting. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secures it?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & soldier; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& soldier; spult the band and reads the prestressing information of the banker. recognizes & soldier; the preset upon the tape is not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Realize & soldier; the ruler, is searching for the appropriate index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the bandindex should be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the bandwork is to indicate that the band has been incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through out-of-time the application for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before taking the banker, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& soldier; gives a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration has been solved for the band and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & soldier, can be used, it must be formatted by & soldier; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-types need to be formatted before you can be used for saving data. this procedure does not correspond to the formatting with & soldier; this procedure is not to be formatted before you start the tape of & soldier; formatted is usually a formatting of the bands, DAT drives on the other hand not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity is running & soldier; with the formatting of the belt. all the data on the tape is lost. after completion of the formation process, the band will automatically be integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the securing files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in the tree. it will only be saved in the profile specified in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Edit...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog will open up settings for backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the disk. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the audit process has been started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the folder's folder.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog will appear to assess. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reconnect the restore, the files you need to be restored, this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry network. it will only be restored to select the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu again...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recreation process has been started, the dialog will appear for restoration. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the folder level for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will be reproducing. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Bandreadxfile on the basis of the Bandreaded file. this process deletes all existing Indexfiles for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Below will create a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current operating folder in which the backup is to be carried out. the list of securing files will be automatically updated according to the selected operating folders.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, the files are stored on the same file system, like the folder. folder that are stored on other filesystem, you can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshots file will be used. only the files you have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup are created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files are gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device driver for the network drives (usually / dev / Tape). this path has to refer to the non-recurrenal version of the bandman.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmits & soldier; before the band is mounted to load the load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or spelling operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, tempted & soldier; the dropping out of the bandwork process. perhaps this attitude does not work with all belt drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Is the option turned on, becomes the loosening of the incorporation of & soldier; automatically the tape unmounted. use this option not at floppy stream.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tempted & soldier; the hardships support variable blockers. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you must communicate & soldier; in any case the block-size for your bandwork will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & soldier; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the banker. this file should occupy only one storage block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is fixed: seconds, whereby the name is the complete name of the system in which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kministry.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can run directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup database. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& Psystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unauthorized users who can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. additionally, experienced users enables quick access to information about problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& Psystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & Psystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system determines the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & Psystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & systemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced functions, with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & Psystemlog; a number of useful functions are among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen shot, & Psystemlog; functions are available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start trying & ksystemlog; first of all, the most important log file of the system - the system's protocol - to open it. it will not be shown that a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system rewalkright. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter on a selected criterion or subtraced strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. in default, a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns contain the string of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. select the text string of the filter protocol. select for example in the protocol-file system protector. select the name of a process so it shows you & Psystemlog; all protocol rows sent to, which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed using a showy color as a protocol-lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off with dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system Protocol or in cron protocol), you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& Psystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& Psystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. find out more information about the sources of & Psystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& Psystemlog, you will also find in the following folder of the & KDE; Subversion archiving: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V init Editor, known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & sysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init develops quickly to the standard for controlling programme-start at the peak of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about yourself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V init without having a new installation and new format. therefore you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc directly into / etc. this folder is called rc.d Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start up the system or change onto another Runlevel. system services contain such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services contain not such things as setserial, which is only once started. such call belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you do it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is included in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably you find that the aforementioned Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can carry out / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you have done something through, then you come to repair the system reboot and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no correct files are. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the a K includes, the script will be called with the argument. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server -Runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & b; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is easy to say not to say, just drag one entry from the range of avable system services to one of the six runways to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift the way between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they extract an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and insert in the target area, even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabs button to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry to another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of a request, press the input button to switch the properties dialog. use the dialog button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or push ESC to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv. otherwise, changes to the preferences will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts anew. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you have to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way that system services can be started in these distributions, but does not correspond to the configuration for the proprietary furnishing programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply quit if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual may be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the relevant icon of the toolbar or save the entry save in the menu File.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user-user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two map cards, the user interface and the user's user list. click on the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have advanced system settings, a map card will be generated, on which you can make individual settings, if shadow-passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map Shop Passliteral appears, if shadow-passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card appears only if necessary for at least a embedded file system (Quota) and initializes (identifiable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here can be modified for any user interface, where space restrictions are stored in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set separately for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the aid of the field file system with space restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user, you can find in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by highlight this in the large field.</seg>
