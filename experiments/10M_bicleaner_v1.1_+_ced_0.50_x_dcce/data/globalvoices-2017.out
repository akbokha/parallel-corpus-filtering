although I had visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies I have read about American music , American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this land had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , a terrible re@@ porter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d which was the Supreme court with judges who were his interest incl@@ ined to occupy .
I was caught .
free from meth@@ od Man , &quot; me it was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , it is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US only .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very sn@@ ap of love over his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he moves with his min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague has put it , and publicly proclaimed his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ US and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in she@@ ar for him .
the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number one ever won by the party nom@@ ination candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ gie person asked me ?
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters to get into harmony with the people during my time in Phoenix .
like for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply glorious man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
likewise , Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view does not coinci@@ ded with the present by Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in finding the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for life long , and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like their son .
it still fits her to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er Council helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those through them have deep@@ ened my love for America .
during the trust of his way to the nom@@ ine@@ es of the presidential race , she offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans gave over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t toward non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ looked these things , broke me nearly the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters to r@@ aci@@ sts .
to put human beings , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears are not considered by the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these voters , most of which are white , for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country they disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; sti@@ cking of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; wording of white in reference to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ sk@@ id trau@@ ma ) as it called the great Van Jones , has made exactly what America has done so magnificent .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is welcome everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with plur@@ ality , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the rod , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood the quantity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ le &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God be praised that Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new country .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love for music by the gar@@ bage
the &quot; Recycling Instruments &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music @-@ school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very narrow connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 o@@ dom@@ eter south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds far from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the village : one of children and adults @-@ acting Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome them with their music instruments .
a music @-@ school with 100 students is a central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs @-@ abuse and ban@@ den violence .
but this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth always offered a rare Hoff@@ man .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , mean the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you come and play with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga .
music from the gar@@ bage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made from re@@ portable waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the fall into instruments .
the instruments im@@ i@@ ti@@ fs , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trumpets , trumpets and percussion , which were all produced from the trash .
the repertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local o@@ ec@@ ologist and musician instructor the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the gar@@ bage - children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one from trash asked violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and live by him are the poorest people - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played Pope Francis in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication occurs within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated in Leban@@ ese waters illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were thus well @-@ driven and little incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative cr@@ ush@@ ter of this kind on its shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles is rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they dar@@ ed to give him one of their ports and so@@ ak himself to give him a fishing head@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply spend everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of lo@@ oting of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , regul@@ ates criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the NR@@ O Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which then exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information out and stand up each other , where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated via definition : what is caught , is hidden , but due to it is extremely difficult to trace . therewith , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
by the obvious dis@@ regard to existing laws , by which certain habitats and ways are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm that a delicate equilibrium .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so the actions happen in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port of port .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of vessels even very attentive when they move on the open sea through satellite data .
this makes it possible to mark the authorities , ships who fish in the Forbidden City . also , so susp@@ ects rides - some those who indicate that a ship loads his fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can be based on this information then the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not sell their charge to their charge . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is a significant financial loss to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD on lost sales to win over the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing boats which attracts the area of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
such practices include as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit licence papers , indicating f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they targeted the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ organised control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sooner a ship could not f@@ lic@@ ally f@@ lic@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ed not walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . and exactly this legal b@@ ang@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has revealed crime networks who have distributed counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties used and it has found wing@@ ed boats and found .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for combating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our tests lead us quite far into organised crime of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to be dil@@ uted ships by precise ships .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , will also help you to hide the illegal ships that likes to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and this is trying to cross through cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support offers .
some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be from satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Marine F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by means of which the position of every single trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that simply gives sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite themselves and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a glob@@ es system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only sense of crimin@@ als , but they also det@@ er them .
ships that were used earlier without a licence and hardly expected with consequences , now they know they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now reached a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , since fishing boats and more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to expand Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing networks whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing every year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . also they are fighting for illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty , the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member countries would report from his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship , which was on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time proof that such special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world @-@ sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there , she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is moving further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the outcome of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela , the request of the opposition had rejected a referendum on a referendum held , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country were lo@@ wered by themselves together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita at the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the term of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ operation at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the type of government in their latest article :
in the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and spices of food and medicine is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extended lack of food and medicine , the referendum held a chance to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time are among others an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also struggles with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
one of the most common images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the prot@@ ag@@ onists of : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;

on Twitter have pictures that tell of conflicts as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police suppression in the central @-@ north @-@ located town of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again but the protests left again .
in other parts of the country , several demonstr@@ ators tried to keep the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira wear no to@@ cks , because otherwise you could see something that many national ni@@ sts do not have !
currency already makes an Info@@ graphic the round that forms the degree of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an official proceedings - this was now proven in the eyes of many innumerable people on the street .
my@@ te@@ ks Media lab@@ s for this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ ci@@ d claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your term recovery !

others have taken this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken a little bit against the devast@@ ated economic crisis and dealt with critical voices .
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .
some dental vene@@ ers reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or buy .

this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ city in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city Córdoba .
now , in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the Cordoba province of Cordoba , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano does not have chosen his life .
starting in the office , the same names as his father carry up to the brutal military per@@ mut@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was right .
I felt like a sal@@ es@@ mag@@ ent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ im@@ eri@@ e@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Chairman of the Secret Army 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent about his child and how this child cho@@ oses a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base .
when my father started to take the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an ar@@ stri@@ l , you have been rounded with one of the ERP .
pass only on that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for www.@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ ists People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become o@@ ei@@ ving .
I was 15 years old and I thought it was fine . for so my father had passed away .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ There are the prisoners being tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything from it was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket wrapped up and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that this was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were put down and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I mo@@ ose in and saw a songs that were tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that she fortified the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was especially captiv@@ ated there .
they rarely generate a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs in the bed , over@@ throwing him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the genit@@ als .

the sten@@ ch there dr@@ on was f@@ oul ... like a dirty winds .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were attached .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people stood with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance kiss@@ ed people quiet on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what gu@@ est thou so , ar@@ sch@@ le ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I met &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father was told at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero lived there for a man and sle@@ w .
( according to the survivors of the civil , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indi@@ cted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina at death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads to the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ dable chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped here came here .
looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then be tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names got altered and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came , that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ cking of men and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Battle @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - as they were called .
but when I was later on the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war mare a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs that one desc@@ ends to an enemy that one fights .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ ute but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who put the cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far then I will find you and bring you self @-@ hanging .
for this we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I carried a jacket and a wheel pul@@ lover made of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still took clothing to her home .
at that time , he accused the defense of being a pity in this crime . I was res@@ ur@@ red , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was anyway there to predi@@ ct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ cord of the ly@@ che is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have only children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well you have been ex@@ alt@@ ated during the dictatorship . but what the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their corp@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also families whose imm@@ ort@@ ality could be passed ?
the we@@ aving of the ly@@ che is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act you can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate imm@@ ort@@ ality rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ush@@ ed and somewhere dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but something of course remains always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought to show my Father was during one conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him alleg@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly cr@@ ashed and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated Patri@@ o@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you brought me up as a child to participate .
he only res@@ ist &quot; Na then &quot; to me . &quot;
just that did I do .
in 2010 , I re@@ charged the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can dict@@ ate me that I have been pre @-@ taken . I finally have said against my own Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing before the end of the process .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , un@@ lawful confin@@ ement in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and one case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 year @-@ old child .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his leader , last month witnesses a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a sign the Japanese word has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps also with Bö@@ sem back@@ ge@@ o &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the bug was Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ otos . he was also who made attention of the Local Newspaper .
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the silent , although gram@@ mati@@ cally is not completely correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &apos;s drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error had already been included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincerely sorry that older people felt honoured by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News sat a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the percentage of older mot@@ orists , the land@@ fill @-@ wide in accidents , but quite an occasion to concern .
in the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of total of 11.@@ 850 Un@@ less .
thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents have fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ i@@ ores caused accidents in the same period has risen in the same period .
the name not named re@@ porter brought in the version of the article comments to the light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seems to be against older mot@@ orists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to transfer , one needs two important skills : passive voice skills to understand the output text , and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case by native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the address language - native speakers .
the English language lear@@ ner should translate from English to French - not from French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue , who could customize translations into English . this may be lacking in comprehension , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who themselves have no foreign employees , have translation nevertheless company internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose British knowledge are considered to be the best brought to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
mechanical translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the pu@@ zz@@ led and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions resulting from machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a long time of human translator . this applies to some languages particularly .
some of the strange official English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be still acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous . but by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
the city of Kyoto takes hope a reliable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors in the internet and television take on
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users , that they could not have access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV also will no longer be available .
also other on @-@ line stations , the protests of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ position@@ ists , who res@@ ist the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was dressed , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ably since 2014 in the coverage of protests . at that time , the Commission wanted to report on tele@@ communication with money and lock@@ ers if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission looked like this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling for violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have already registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that is still cheaper than to purchase two liters of lime .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was un@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly carries out their sessions .
previous research resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet provider will sometimes use DNA . this is a technique if the DNS server will answer questions of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the inquiry when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third anointed channel , the transmission was submitted on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV Cam@@ ero@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which was transferred to the protests in Caracas .
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten , while he was in police @-@ care .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans have access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on current events in the country forever .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves for slaves .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies @-@ out of other Cri@@ mes that have been the same as they have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from cur@@ ity , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation gradu@@ ation , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta you can work in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes its minor son or her min@@ der@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in the exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , is that the children have to do for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and the victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract one cannot up@@ lift .
this practice is widely distributed in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ation of their study , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - above all young girls from the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled witness , researched and denoun@@ ced .
they tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of Gr@@ atitude , which is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ b@@ bon is guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family that gave her daughter in faith that she is doing so her education to improve their position in society and can make something out of themselves , to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who plays the girl in himself and jus@@ ti@@ fies their exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get a school@@ ing and maybe even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is susp@@ icious , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they even experience it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon had previously held that held in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households but a face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . shortly afterwards she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Military @-@ related Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials in the dormitory .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last best@@ seller in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela set the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of the cri@@ b@@ ish practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows as children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the Marri@@ age and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a fast investigation of the fall .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes from judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín is the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay one case comes from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ b@@ bon is exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to all work and began to sell on the road or the market sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has worked in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
Friday for example , she cle@@ ars the fridge , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ crip@@ fied the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home and had time to learn .
the more they had finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hunger , but was also not uncommon . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books out of the library of the landlord as eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; she remembered .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to standing and editorial from op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but did not work with her . &quot; the host had someone found who he listened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I wanted to learn &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ tee , to return home again their native con@@ vocation .
their Lord feared that they had the formation , which she had made her to lose again , explains them .
but she was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything she was paid from them with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken , bullying and the ra@@ kan@@ gar@@ ds are exposed to those cri@@ es when they go to school .
because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I was able to invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time , where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I was not part of a group .
the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view jobs for clean@@ ings and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city carrier in the district As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please contact you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; lifts &quot; and a lot of comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s interior who wants to work . &quot;
then the fi@@ bers inter@@ cep@@ ted into the display once again :

in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors ) and the native population ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to be considered as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the plant of Men@@ s@@ ú ( in which the workers left as semi @-@ slaves ) , that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative draft writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixteen Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ aries have recently voted on a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is adopted by the Parliament , the users and users of social media must register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the law would then be a place set up , which is commissioned to use citizens to use their permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the Act , users and users would have to register on the website of the site with their right names and personal numbers , in order to be able to use social networks .
if it failed to do this , so that a penalty could bring up to six months in prison or a bu@@ sty .
the bill that consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt records , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running through the internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed , as the draft is not able to impose on how Egyptian authorities are to create the user &apos;s users and users the registration . unclear is also how they make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password &quot; to get through the firewall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning a firewall at the national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans stand .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical with regard to the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior researchers &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strong on technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with things to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control the physical public and private spaces it could be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they are a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s mandate and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; represents in line with a pro @-@ military thought @-@ art in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating fo@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliam@@ ent@@ ate Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y struck a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was destined for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tiersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the wit@@ ty Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which belong through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are still less prey .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard the only surviving car@@ nation in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the eco @-@ system also depends on the fact that a large car@@ ver is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat at the camera all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as well @-@ educated bi@@ olog@@ s , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in research studies with wild@@ ly living animals and in educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones are set up for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 documented , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; Trinity catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , tsun@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster had triggered disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ eri@@ ous pre@@ fecture of Japan , northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring generation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ata were forced to cut off , because the tsun@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
still , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows which progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ established authority as well as survey results of the person concerned .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement cottage ( I@@ arians , Re@@ qu@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ k .
the biggest success under the three pre@@ fecture was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement centers were completed .
I@@ w@@ ata has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is formed by 70 percent in the final light .
nevertheless , one is still trying to reloc@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ity of Beh@@ el@@ u@@ ild@@ ing ( I@@ arians , cas@@ c@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final sub@@ stitutes .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation accommodations .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodation .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , while in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated goods , which were rebuilt after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ arri@@ vals , were renovated in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ata the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could identify , have 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the unbeliev@@ ing , its doors down to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ orts have res@@ umed its operation .
the tsun@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima again .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear un@@ fail@@ ing , since only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ ands by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ests itself , tourism has res@@ umed again and again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains down@@ cast far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata are back to 90 percent at the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand can only have 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is harder to feel their livel@@ i@@ hood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to find an overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous pol@@ ls among the local population and under the evacu@@ ated by . they asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sensation has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper writes :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population of experience .
the survey took that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of respon@@ dents are found that still not enough in matters of disasters prevention .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has raised their attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to territories outside of the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23 000 people were ren@@ amed back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare @-@ homes .
after the 2017 state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas are still alive , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper accommodation projects , because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ata and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive building projects . this is construction projects that part of the Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the similarities .
after a while , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat themes which often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which she felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ah Cam@@ ar@@ asa reminded how the love of music worked for the lack of common language knowledge during a journey in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma , after he was be@@ aten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday , a police officer was be@@ aten during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás studied , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors carried him this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local picture of Lu@@ iz da Luz has made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police force is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the case of active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police could test of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long in television and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz to the net on which one sees , as Mat@@ eus remains attacked by the police officers and several sanitary briefly pointed to it .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook calls for Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in the memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated in secondary schools . here , the military police force of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App has been killed , and now we have been attacked by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has attacked him with a stroke .
police over@@ handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday came to brutal police attacks against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker point against violence against prot@@ esters .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has inter@@ cep@@ ted the Brazilian media by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a distor@@ ted glass window to design with a picture of its front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a title story with one in fire set .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken waves than about the protests of thousands who serve the defence of a special thing .
this must also recognize , if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence performed by the police police are distor@@ ted by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conspir@@ acy to the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the For@@ gotten villages in Cuba from the un@@ induc@@ ing liber@@ alisation
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar farms throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harv@@ ests locally .
it is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar be@@ et factories .
after the creation , the sugar cane of sugar in the region was quiet , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the smells from steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some are rarely the work .
others design@@ ate and comm@@ uting daily to factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the su@@ gar@@ be@@ et industry does not smoke its sleep .
he heard that there are sugar be@@ et factories in the east of the sugar be@@ et factories that have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene shar@@ pen@@ ed exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the su@@ gar@@ ment industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amoun@@ ting to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a mo@@ tive to concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad stories are already no news .
why was the Cub@@ an su@@ gar@@ be@@ et industry switched off ?
the old train station of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar raw materials was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were in@@ viable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production purpose was 4 million tons .
they only left the factories , the sugar for a maximum of four Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) can produce .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the chance rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food organisation of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe @-@ export would be around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the feeding of a total of 98 su@@ gar@@ s factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order that the place will get , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first encounter year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addressing date and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any discharge .
from there on the other hand , the responsibility and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the close factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the su@@ gar@@ be@@ et su@@ gar@@ be@@ et factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will to the nursing of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been eliminated .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the working places and achievements that were generated in the congregations in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech from October 21 , 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer working for five years , everything would work well .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar components
since 2004 sugar cane is only extract high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the People Church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things have changed , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better said than they started to dis@@ counting them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they were made to spare parts .
without future perspectives , many young people left the region again .
the area was created a food factory , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ in@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldiers a re@@ ente of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no noc@@ tur@@ nal person , nevertheless he gives the lies which one told him not .
it has been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it lacks a force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and to maintain their own culture

adolescents from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour have been launched directly to schools and youth centers for 2014 workshop , youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by educ@@ ating David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree Communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop increases that the young participants come in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever of them come into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kite daily , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Can@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mo@@ tive of a video player to im@@ part how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved received something from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like I would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on Earth my days
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead to our youth

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ ph@@ ur to pur@@ u ( which is issued , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each forwarding , which is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacturing of these plastic hosts .
in the Tokyo district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that just produce those plastic courts , which was documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic hosts are usually found that they are not even closer to them . however , a new trend will transform them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ te , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic sur@@ geri@@ es de@@ formed mobile lig@@ aments , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y and objects as in this case , cool@@ ed cabinet magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ k refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences becomes increasingly ascending .
in this case a ca@@ ste @-@ don was turned ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) into a mobile phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
also this part is made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to watch like an apple , with a candle for the phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing excursion into strange .
some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon @-@ che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can put my mobile phone with sal@@ mon @-@ che@@ ated ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in Plas@@ tic@@ ated can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile @-@ stands has the form of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon .
more Cor@@ si@@ cal plastic meals can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the serving the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ l san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of fighting against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against the trafficking of drugs &quot; in Mexico experiencing the missing and mot@@ h regularly only in statistics . however , this does not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy , that this struggle entails .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chef of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stand behind any corp@@ se , behind any bone results in the hundreds of heimer tom@@ bs , the stories of innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trafficking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which aims to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who were reported in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers , and whole communities have to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks out of the weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
priests : &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task today that we have provided us , go and go to graves after the people we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are at the assurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get it paid because the one being assessed .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state of state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexican .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disease and Sens@@ ing journalism I know now for some years now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m passing every day at Zeitungs@@ ki@@ os@@ ken and see the front pages with pictures that actually originate from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acc@@ ents of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the uni@@ fying thing or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or look at this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be great if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me that is , when they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid to have something like that .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ sensitivity of men is incredible for me if death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they were &quot; infl@@ ated . &quot;
I think they try to admit , that they will be spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies when they are not touching and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the post &quot; Four months Ex@@ press@@ tion in the main city center : how a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed up . in this describes it , as armed crime month for month money from their business , until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their families apart .
you think about everything you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain over it never ends , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to dec@@ eive or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to crying . I must learn to live with the ache .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; generation . &quot;
in the introduction he asks questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the fleet with water , sugar and dairy powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and which had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been over for two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody re@@ venge of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a racing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of morality to the public safety and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s prosecution was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ a per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand @-@ thousands stories , which leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
few stories still live in light of the new head@@ lines . but this project is remin@@ is@@ cent of those who we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data launched , whose aim is to provide the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , contain images , on which violence is represented .
the fact@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lift a rum@@ ours or to un@@ lock a fake .
but how is the year after something the first time has emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &apos; or &apos; false context &apos; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a gas @-@ wagon saw the place of San@@ ge in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and explo@@ ded , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated it . the streets in the region became a dangerous paths became full of kno@@ bs which were difficult to drive .
of course , the gas @-@ wagon fell victim to the victim .
official venue described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who illumin@@ ate the World Cup .
houses f@@ ished and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to in@@ con@@ fession .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users mysti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it displays rows trun@@ cated body that are st@@ utter@@ ed on the floor while people watch them .
but here history does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo has been imposed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in terms of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am took on the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burnt down and corp@@ ses were placed in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were cr@@ ush@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite pictures could be shown the consequ@@ ential time .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ agonist in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the picture emerges from the Democratic Republic of Congo as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre to 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ steps ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from San@@ ge also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning review , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and several t@@ ote , some by com@@ bus@@ tion .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , to summar@@ ize this description with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed by the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being has told monks and politicians to have participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to consult this information .
the original contribution , which was taken up on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations working AF@@ P as their source , had also mistak@@ enly sent this statement , but were not associated with the image from the DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false information
traces of these false sounds are back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turned image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine ink Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( stand of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private sites , platforms of social media and Community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , others tries to dis@@ miss the counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
we have tr@@ apped examples for the abuse of use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we aim to be more visible than by the language only .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) several examples may be used for ab@@ usive use .
here are some cases that can now be missed completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of the false cou@@ plings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ ti@@ dal countries will point out on pages or servers , about the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ se@@ messages still available .
the countries in grey are examples which are according to the metadata and information available about ink Eye , probably also ho@@ vering examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar released a ri@@ vo@@ icing on what she got as &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alized news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
this ri@@ vo@@ icing , which is published exclusively in English , includes references to counterf@@ eit pictures of smells that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other way ( which is often spread from Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed at the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR Congo are NOT to kill Christians that kill Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ a Being had given birth that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture remains in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been updated by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published from now deleted news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declares that the picture does not stem from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it had a &quot; similar d@@ ashing attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in orbit , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dunk@@ er U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo is do@@ cked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and sol@@ dering a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , the mut@@ ations in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the Mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ im 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saves ) . but the messages that were associated with it were attacked in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message , which was supposedly being written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , translated the discussion on discussion like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the false message .
from the embassy in which the picture from the DR Congo has been , is the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and inter@@ fere with images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original date of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that draw these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming also uses the picture to discuss how an African life is valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with social media , there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tional part to exercise the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ se@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the real atro@@ cities of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ holding of pictures of a wound is equal to recognize the tragedy . at times these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that violent images and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which under@@ sought how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot about violent representations in the news media , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techn@@ ologists experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about situation where a picture suggests something , which actually may also be solved by context or completely mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous type .
however , any examination of false supplements should also take into account how internationally they can be .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ covered ) attempts to offer language inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese su@@ ck ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ists stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly for any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for quite a while in an on @-@ line list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ tage language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Do you think about your parents in recognition of how to make you effort in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ re@@ q language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness which you feel after getting ri@@ pped in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they def@@ ences other cultures , revealing other thought cor@@ ds and awak@@ ens our new earth .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ brid@@ geable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is the worst cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst flood of flood and lands@@ l disaster in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun that usually supports the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the river .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud win@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe areas of stay .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the resi@@ stor@@ s in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic flood :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ re@@ rise , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rains are already on the way .
today , the Car@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level of up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also over@@ floo@@ ded because of the water he@@ ater of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the air @-@ monkey has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made for transportation of not@@ ches for those made in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have already been explained to help .
Facebook @-@ pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ ebo@@ ats are required for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and vital goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ at@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if they need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) ask for people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ agus is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ uprising Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed the users to pick up a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ish R@@ ote cross .
likewise , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ oting , caused by high water and lands@@ li@@ zed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , they bring people in need of security and help aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan has now pending the long road until the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and dear friend .
I trust my four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ce .
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ating we are rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head upright , tied from a American flag , others sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built itself in their conception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they dish@@ e@@ ze me .
there are 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we will all be put into the same Muslim genre .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination so as soon as Muslims , who like me do not fit , Muslim .
det@@ erg@@ es are being re@@ fr@@ ised
I am not alone with it alone .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry in America is master@@ sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when the Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea the religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a big part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the redu@@ ci@@ istic pictures of Muslims , the Western books have been colonial for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man they should be afraid and the exotic woman that one should save .
the landmark Palestinian American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ filed in the 1970s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues they continue .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty f@@ ool will dominate our news .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this car fails to realize that if French , Muslim men are forced to carry her head to@@ wel in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ arab@@ ic , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong s@@ cars weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which was so far been brought with slave @-@ vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the aim of tim@@ us@@ li@@ ous attacks and ra@@ ils .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
belonging to the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to have failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed where seven million Muslims constitute the highest level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ milit@@ ant Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my dad worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan had re@@ imagined the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ converted Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if I ask people why I say no por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or to carry my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims wear in themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ chief with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists that make efforts to fight widespread lies above Islam .
these lies are produced in the current volume of a well @-@ trained Islam@@ ist forces with ATM , Th@@ ink Tanks and experts for fal@@ se@@ information that is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stran@@ ger , who under@@ lining a woman the head to@@ wel .

Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms takes up our adher@@ ence .
it attacks our identity so far is so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten .
use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if soci@@ alistic religious life describe , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor in the bran@@ ce see that I &apos;m Muslim when it could look through the 15 feet concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would see the ever @-@ end@@ ent ritual with my daughter , when I meet them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the protection of the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to me is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal part with her sisters , as she won in the art of the art of flower in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be almost maneu@@ ver@@ able .
Muslim means to speak the prayers they had told me if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as she brought me to God , to refer me to God , Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that has been colonial - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; colonial , which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ comp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to call upon my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying al@@ ana J@@ aan um@@ f@@ aded his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as in my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists have been tac@@ kl@@ ed , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans all have col@@ alized up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ eger@@ bom@@ b of history was rejected in front of a century via a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ch@@ ash@@ mir of British empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion things go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent aside from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , distributed in Iraq , to hunt mass destruction of weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide is increased under veter@@ an since 2001 by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story will be reported for four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ emp@@ hr@@ er named Bil@@ ali Muhammad is ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
an Americ@@ anism , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist who understands the inherent inter@@ se@@ duction of our with multiple bonds , but to fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ es , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ anism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build up to this two @-@ dimensional Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ars , started with President Bush and joined President Obama .
it consists in constant monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that excl@@ u@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bom@@ bs which we cast upon Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories that we tell and due to those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientific un@@ correct picture and allow them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the vibrations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep into being a Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging that we ste@@ ered in our news media .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , who tried to identify our many ties with ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Grove , S@@ ay center of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ all Muslim ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lier Muslim writers , and MS Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ically , mus@@ li@@ misch , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
examine screenshots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tioning of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am worried due to this difficult global time@@ points in which we are .
and that time has consequences , which go beyond the 1,@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason for the conspir@@ acy that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House is leading .
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslims as &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years ago it had not been given yet ; now they have master large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the realities and history I was not aware of as I was as old now , as it is my daughter now , but who have made me today an in@@ cum@@ ming Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ der in my speech .
things that may awaken memories , because in all the inter@@ ctions that makes our humanity a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation stations took place within the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics , talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools to read or read our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation was educated , four decades ago was scientific of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being aware and consciously hurry the &quot; other &quot; because the employment is that we have no president in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; people being bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , of Flickr users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is a possible response in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already carried out events , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project are :
the mass of mass of languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that incorporate diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to be associated with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often related to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate , or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so carry out their dedication and depic@@ tion that the audience can be aware of it .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ate also the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ rati@@ ves for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the nav@@ el from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having declared the meaning of his nav@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of incl@@ usi@@ veness :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can arrange with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico challenges from the US new sub@@ stitution of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ inspection of public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participating in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ zz@@ ory Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ go@@ ose .
it was declared by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front ) for the ne@@ ural exam of the debt ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ sic church assembly in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debts of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debt to be held responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial review and a Gui@@ ding committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions for re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy .
we are pressed and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be able to find out with decl@@ ining retirement .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the sovereign territory of the USA - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on state @-@ responsibility , as an alternative to existing state @-@ view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed action will become danger without the participation and conviction of citizens , being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration brought the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators are preparing for the march ahead .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web @-@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference held in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel @-@ Camp@@ a@@ ign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher from the Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive enquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is available here licence @-@ free , contains a number of attempts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers and authors who have involved in the movements for free knowledge , have side on side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something meaning from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved , beloved , and celebrating internet volunteers who is det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of the Ad@@ ra prison , where he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back into his normal life and in freedom immediately .
to see how bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us begin to start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developers for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military facility to an in@@ famous place .
his wife , the writer and At@@ tor@@ tin N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of one as &quot; strictly secret &quot; drawn command of the military geri@@ doo from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and made them aware of a alleged death prize against her husband .
his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and moment@@ ary of leaders of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of bas@@ eline cultural prototype predic@@ tive as the work that he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross @-@ cross of many civilizations , and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ky traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike into the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
yet , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhelmed when I call up his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught other in@@ sti@@ lling to write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he carried me the internet at .
he also included other in@@ ders as they use computer , at least theoretically , without having held them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ ste ) , a promot@@ er that she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ le and N@@ oura have worked together for a year together on the book .
she sho@@ cked the lyrics to him when she visited him and he over@@ sat them from the Arabic Arabic .
the book is roy@@ alty @-@ free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening on every visit ,
that I have failed in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I loose the reflection in the moment we embrace .
that any of the haz@@ ards does not matter
each of the f@@ ences , bondage and watch@@ man
I forget the memorial of the prison
and I put in every detail of your voice and words ,
which I am engaged with passion
if your eyes are happy to say
and I have another piece of my soul with you ...

those who were arrested or lost under non@@ violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption corruption director after release in prison , he returned to previous post .
Mos@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger in a corrupt , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endants was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for suspici@@ on of 54 million me@@ tic@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , what happened on 19 April in 2016 .
in accordance with an opinion of the prosec@@ utor gener@@ acy of the Republic , which had evaluated the motion , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ return to his old position , as the company has no discipl@@ in@@ arity after his custody .
however , many citizens do not have the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that uses public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re@@ tire the director :
represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that even the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the contra@@ sting thought .
however , the company apparently ple@@ aded and led no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , this behavior also leans off and considers the case as &quot; res@@ ellers &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to prison and took half of them .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and to polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrated into the company he helped to add harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is willing to pay for his silence .
res@@ ists !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director said no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he radi@@ ate him I can not believe that someone has rewarded someone in such way that the state has already massi@@ vely ins@@ ulted so massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead have only served themselves by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand to get an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , who was sentenced and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te fav@@ ors the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
Di@@ stra@@ in@@ ers belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , c@@ lic@@ able , and - next to said - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was , when he acknowledged , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , including the country for its ambitions , its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious human being changes , my experience indicates that which is not so . he changes the tactics but it does not affect its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious human being crimin@@ als at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also refused :

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means her@@ edi@@ tary or spher@@ ical .

according to information from Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well known social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although about the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective .
Facebook Ar@@ med the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely low con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in trying to fight a speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensual content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself is not automatically called a hate language automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the purpose of his usage .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ las@@ h@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he enth@@ uses the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a wit@@ ty way whether he could catch his back pain , he made a word of words .
the set of ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it will reduce a speech of radi@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishers all posts linked to the suspici@@ on , racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the Automatic is not understood what you write on Fac@@ il@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the words below .
for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( sp@@ las@@ b@@ sen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good is that this three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the hate language , a fairly good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , to spread the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy might not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often is a pair and mouse game , whereby users can use social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use post , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not addressed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or they simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking radi@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office has been removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
aging such words will only bring even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ nia curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to report the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of lots of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make things funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ edi@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to check whether Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
in the last five years there are extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to extend their voices and influence .
among other things , a speech in social networks should in addition to heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar , in addition to heat , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure , critic@@ ised the emig@@ rate of hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of getting the word &apos; calf &apos; , it would have better running , rather more focused on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the mono@@ gam@@ y is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to establish a law which aims to ban this practice , so that the universal age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the Act , some members held un@@ du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities on the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not inter@@ fere , because that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this also happened in the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of UN children &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors , each person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and 18 percent were 8.2 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical Central Office of the country showed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements , who tried to create laws for the child before , followed by the foot and pleasing their great support . undoubtedly , they hal@@ ted them to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should not look after their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition only sort of tension in this actually in@@ complicated thing , and at some point , there were doubts as to whether the opposition would dis@@ agree with the law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority could make him a law .
now it is necessary to agree with the President of the country and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which reads Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against child before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices and no one on the other hand .
after having been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook @-@ Member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was appointed Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary just needed that the core of the matter has disappeared , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and that is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to run the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the law of law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 Victor ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which list@@ ens to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which was quite openly talking about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the hei@@ r Age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years .
the draft amending the Act was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present during the vote .
all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law .
the to@@ e is not permitted by law in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ ren@@ swe@@ at .
many thanks to all activists who have created him .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Bir@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake political steps , the law should be passed and he seems to redeem his promises now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the prosec@@ utor Adv@@ oc@@ ate Paris Al @-@ wi , a fe@@ asi@@ bility of the law , unless Mahar@@ aj against the law wants to proceed with most social media users , you would go the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and un@@ m@@ wood may cause that the state , our daughters , protects them from large , hard @-@ minded males who are against them in the benefit , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal and still the norm continues , although there are laws they are saying .

according to China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform complet@@ es all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is not available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) we put everything that sn@@ apshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the site www.@@ wikipe@@ di@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was also reminded that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock .

a ne@@ pal@@ e@@ ous Wild@@ tier@@ photographer only uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection

photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and distinguished colors .
the motiv@@ ate himself to carry him a camera with him and try to understand the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring about Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as wildlife to the international stage .
and its home place right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direc@@ ts the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife .
he described on Facebook , like him this first @-@ class position in his work helps :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! !
I rested just at home when myself called Navar@@ ur@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to sn@@ ub ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nept@@ une and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so aw@@ ful as they look .
and he should know it because he stood tig@@ ers already from face to face :
a tiger can be disturbing from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ cky appeared . he immediately moves , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( ite . : I clicked for Environmental Protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nept@@ une and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned to the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a , condemned by a hypo@@ cris@@ y and ch@@ ased by her family and the village community after they had made an un@@ married relative .
the tradition of their wives are also not called by men , is also widely spread among men . however , they have far less pres@@ ump@@ tions to fear , if at all , what , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , occurred nine women , among them health staff as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were quickly became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and supports the reduction of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the revealing of practices , like children &apos;s he@@ aters up to the aband@@ on@@ ment of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
it tells about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambass@@ adors of the change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was the case of women who did not call their hus@@ bands with their name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the discussion on the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of her husband does not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; utter@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bread that they have been fully maintained and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as sne@@ ak@@ ening , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion to this discussion .
at the beginning was Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , who had never called his name at home as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the baggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round raw ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , affection@@ ate , loving and so on .
then , they asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break of an ancient tradition , in which married women could never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she had just before him throughout the practice ; another chose to allow the whole of frustration to him and his family by curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adrenal@@ ine rush along with an ancient br@@ is also broken , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call her husband in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another cl@@ ub@@ member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law she became scar@@ ed , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding , and the situation began in force .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic red point on the forehead , which indicates the divor@@ ce :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he also acts .
he was laugh@@ ed only and I heard that to bear him .
the other women have not completely abandoned , but think they are in a better position to choose themselves , not to carry him on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion during each discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure who what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in her life they celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced , and were talking about things about whom they had never thought of thought .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working with these problems for so many years and yet I have been linked to some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have been linked to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to say certain things according to it , no matter how small they appear .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have taken only Sar@@ is since her marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a broad shirt over a p@@ ants , wear ; they did not dar@@ ed .
after much dispute and discussion on the merits of own clothes , mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , gr@@ ace@@ ful Roh@@ ini their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they have decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion I had changed a little , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming up in rolls :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and are not any other family members .
only one or two shall continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women now contribute to any time in Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ langes for more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating the river .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also like this .
but this pru@@ b gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain of chain when every woman goes home in the club and other people of it reported what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 are considered to be a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , marked 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has enough to rot@@ ate the Japanese .
the people here became clear quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the K@@ ult@@ band is more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian review .
good morning ! , today &apos;s the Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration in Japan . meanwhile , it was 51 years ago .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ ao@@ ke bars and in the English @-@ class teaching in Japanese Central schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration .
we all love in our house the Beat@@ les .
I don &apos;t know if these &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; - doll by John Lenn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places that are related to the band .
when you love the Beat@@ les , you &apos;re the Beat@@ les , you are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )

exactly today in the year 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! rose to a pilgrimage to London and ran via Abbey Road .
the same did we did last year too .
and of course , some companies are using the Fan@@ als also in market @-@ related techniques , such as this R@@ ams Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! , today &apos;s Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ acial heads for Organ@@ ic , probably for aber@@ rated purposes , anxiety the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations in life to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men in the district Mil@@ ange were killed , a few kilometers from border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently stressed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glass @-@ piece of gold could bring gold enth@@ ou@@ ble or wealth , explained the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that we have registered the following attacks on extra @-@ scale men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN 2016 held a mission in the South African country to examine these Prak@@ tik .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighboring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the assass@@ ination was arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of the gl@@ aring men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ it@@ ud@@ inal individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for pres@@ um@@ ably higher rituals , has given cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sham@@ ans into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power , the wealth generated .
in the last days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces :

in November 2015 Bas@@ sels wife N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , she had been contacted by people who gave himself to himself as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably was recently made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney ended at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 Li@@ u sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after joining the Charter of the Charter , a manifes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China was involved .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal business &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told , he said it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to call on the international community to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet , Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him to have a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely un@@ covered .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
pointer R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ le , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government taught that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon in China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news was circul@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to its adher@@ ence , he was not able to counter his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us on the same day as she told us in a statement on 30 June .
at the same time , we expect China to lift all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it was with his help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities , not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of their house arrest .
the challenge of the U.S. Embassy attracted an angry response from China after themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as free movement and access to medical care of its choice on which they claim to be according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing to Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Chancellor St@@ effen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of news agency Re@@ uters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked to provide appropriate medical care available to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us An@@ walt told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia that could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Li@@ u with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um is talking about :
Canada demands China , its international human rights , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old and release the rights of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry proposed to release China in a Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , is needed . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news station France Info already reported that the French government of Li@@ u would welcome in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of solid affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and call for a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party Party , China also called on to allow the sick of intellectual Li@@ u to let themselves deal with Taiwan in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed itself very worried in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous whose China would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear sil@@ ly as Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the Blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the International branches of the Association of New York , the Ministers agreed that many people have critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he appreci@@ ates that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn its logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , you will say that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a breach of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory infringement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , Wh@@ ose country is it ?
the reasons made by Shan@@ gr@@ ace@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one can &apos;t measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore is compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers to be forward , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers were given in the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am responses to his American guests with regard to our press , our youth @-@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls the Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city is , the country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our precious K Shan@@ gr@@ at would take the effort to clear this point unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by pointing on the blog his comment , he points concerning the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he for@@ ested Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party long ago ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has obviously not meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am beyond what the judicial Minister of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ ds , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it correctly and become aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ appearances the spots of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr Shan@@ gr@@ ace@@ am &quot; tru@@ thful a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher instructor ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the Intergovernmental Panel , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of hard@@ est importance .
why do the rulers have their military service , defend it only their city but not their country ?
whom should our Prime Minister withdraw invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel tracks ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
refer@@ enced the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of ambition ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Kan@@ adi@@ te &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect to your home country or home country ?
your responses will be published here as part of a sequ@@ ent series , with which rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am living from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite , interested in his meeting partner by showing personal questions .
at my clear position then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook maybe in@@ war@@ dly before anger , when they are held for Americans , but me doesn &apos;t b@@ other .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all Love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ...
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , prior to the invasion of Iraq and 11 September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small h@@ hor@@ n@@ uns on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their american neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we clearly say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is alle@@ ge@@ dly known as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admired .
I would not make up anything , if you would like to change myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : being called &quot; nett , &quot; is basically to be st@@ unn@@ ingly - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but fully @-@ significant figure of N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ ped@@ estri@@ ans ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can encounter .
being harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around a round .
I would even as far as going to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main peculi@@ ar of Can@@ adi@@ ans is .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence across the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au head the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada even sexy .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Thailand &apos;s jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video which took over the Jun@@ ta which took power in 2014 and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government , continue to govern@@ s the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military domin@@ ance of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to express the situation of the country .
the video about the song was great success .
within the first three days alone , it was shared on Facebook uploaded to Facebook 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists open the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has per@@ sec@@ uted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the Dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which has given the ruler &apos;s absolute decision @-@ making power over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setup change &quot; by journalist , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded as critics by the Jun@@ ta .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , which surv@@ eyed online content and persons , which are pre@@ dominant , the monarchy is for@@ ged to have prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pped gest@@ ures against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Convention ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to trace is their decision @-@ to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security expert they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax collector .
in the video even shows how people are thrown into a black shipping car before it brings them into an intern camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and have caused Internet users to off@@ end long prison @-@ off@@ ences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , shown the Solomon &apos;s song from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; who has already been used by put@@ sch &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Amor@@ sia , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians living and exhau@@ sts live in the area .
such settlements are also called violin cities in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here today , today there are only a few hundred people in these violin cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district has risen 16@@ ,000 people after over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residences of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called the Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deser@@ ted and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native mature man .
he begins a conversation and it falls him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
it is still unique . &quot;
the village was full of life before the war .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , served by the community .
now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people that once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the district by now .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , you will recognize at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girlfriend a little too and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of scenic products for self @-@ purpose ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the laps .
the District administration offers free candles and bread in the winter free of charge .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave early @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart is always staying in Asia @-@ Asia , &quot; tells her .
Gal@@ ina would like to assume financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead support her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; gives them too .
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet and celebrate the holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this continuously - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her too . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s conversation with Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the co@@ il before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia simply broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative town in Ab@@ ch@@ sia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
your man works in the hol@@ low @-@ pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation than many people left the village after the war .
but over time , they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember that the city and war were once . &quot;
as our talk to the end , a little boy had gone over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted to him .
he plays with the ball , who sends the hill down .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the dropped buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure troub@@ le@@ edness in their lives .
you do not know it different .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants on her long journey
Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ stri@@ ell and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with large sto@@ cking walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is quite quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on Kart@@ on .
it does not want to refuse anyone .
she helps them too and bring her to the hospital if they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medications they can not pay them , mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; respond with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull towards north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : he has sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send their often text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ind them or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez might be very well known , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were included in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold for too expensive .
he started to help them a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all@@ an@@ ed , has offered it to its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers consult their phones .
a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a lot from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gi@@ cally because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ mother they sle@@ eves in their album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ es that you have done a manifestation , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and Old .
they laughs , while she put them briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a monitoring app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , sel@@ ector the right
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July the mobile users in Tian@@ shan district of the City Uru@@ m@@ qi received a cell phone alert , in which it indicates the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because it was just after they have installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was to identify and track the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , of online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course , an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers allows to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , the reality is very often dis@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , pressing ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the dis@@ satisfaction and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ down .
this published on Twitter @-@ based media outlets &quot; Images from Main@@ land China , &quot; ( In@@ dies ) , the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the polic@@ eman the residents un@@ checked as if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have been comp@@ elled to use tools that are meant for older people to use .
this is a form of imprisonment by means of rest technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( the Re@@ vi@@ val ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang your computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associated institutions , including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , mentioned also these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st August to register their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , phones , external drives , portable hard disk drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible associations , including those , which refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;

far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realise that you are completely alone in one place where all the Import@@ ant has disappeared .
everything has been dissolved , and the truth is revealed , which is clearly visible both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honour .
one that has de@@ pressed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ us , the beautiful scenes and the performers - transform the characters into being out of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ am to death .
all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth is moving on the axis of the we@@ dge . you realize that you are tr@@ apped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to build stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this still does not make me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security services it formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us in evidence by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five adolescents were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests .
it eman@@ ates to the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ scre@@ ams .
all the city districts on , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ression , for the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city which is pushed to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down slightly after the power supply in the area stopped .
I broke the still@@ ness by crying several times &quot; all@@ ine &quot; from my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ist .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to put together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a beautiful image that filled my expectations fully and totally fulfilled .
in such a moment you are aware that you have released the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the t@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at military security buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give your voice to you , after you have caught it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me listen , as you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ edge @-@ filled eyes p@@ aving to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before that building .
perhaps it was on my door@@ man , van@@ ity , maybe at the revolution .
I was so certain of my job as I said , &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to look into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi@@ bits him in individual and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sw@@ ank of this twi@@ light is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , an emotional torture , which I was exposed to months .
I sh@@ out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I am tra@@ ded with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hallway to the individual cells .
I conc@@ eive all details exactly before I managed the room .
otherwise than usual , they probably have assigned me a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one more prisoners and may immediately set me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I handle an old @-@ proven communication method : to strike on the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ in@@ mate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me eventually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a respectable man middle aged man , who sees me much and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there is no distinctive face to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sound like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers to their existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would confi@@ de him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
then I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ wing , which lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be approximately 10 am in the evening : always around this time the fri@@ ght , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of the per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in Person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret was clear : to protect the security in front of us and to prevent the betra@@ yal of terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al card and bol@@ ts the close eye view of her world view .
this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I supervised the audi@@ tory and tre@@ ach@@ utes on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky male ; at least he comes so before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life when joining these diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to respond .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows after a friendly interview have become an ordinary communication of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment .
to punishment in all their variety .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the lovingly &quot; Gest@@ ure . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hi@@ ker rejo@@ iced in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot keep your terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my horror fell not yet enough , which is why they re@@ direc@@ ts the pipe by a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if that was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present ourselves out of their vision , great invention of a huge Kab@@ els .
within a single hour three of them is scar@@ ed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to cry .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no favor by doing so , which is why he handle an electri@@ cally invited staff .
stream flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ bare body , which lay down on the ground was the perfect electric conduc@@ tors .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours left , that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I responded with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must make fri@@ ghtful worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time in@@ doors : sometimes he lo@@ dges to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , every now and again to his couch .
but what you can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine inhal@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which was one of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel did its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , who often deals with topics like Orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a person who is not restricted in its mind by limits , and he can feel co @-@ ordin@@ ated according to his own statement , who under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he puts a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against US American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , to do anything with his identity as the Palestinian refugees of the second generation , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own life conditions so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured out in water off Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also states that public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
generally speaking the gap of warm coffee and the swe@@ ep of the k@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost by freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking into the neighboring countries .
from therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water to drink - in order not to land in prison .
recently the interior of the Ministry of Jordan has canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ aries who support the Islamic Action Plan - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual , Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradi@@ cts and the main reason for the concert .
the S &amp; D spokes@@ person in the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; has been canc@@ eled &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the gar@@ ment .
many also claim to prove the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , whether the old @-@ proven legitimacy from author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a said the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to be quite simply sil@@ ently rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a clear and cryst@@ all@@ able reality in Jordan reflect that in H@@ ai@@ bs work clearly appears .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards become f@@ aint by having his vision of the fate of Arab women formed the pre @-@ eli@@ ke sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly formed un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan , the number of &quot; volunteers &quot; has increased the in@@ official outside in Jordan .
human Rights Watch , according to the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its climax ; however , Jordan is still lacking that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of morality or domestic violence to provide adequate manner .
according to a law on breaking struggle from 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence in 1954 , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen .
also H@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also do not shy away from themes that are long in his country as tab@@ le@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ tre@@ ach that his work is politically , however , that he cannot separate his music , the full of explicit approaches to sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann .
I became a policy dre@@ amed , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or failure , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comments on equality by LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored up to 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya to mention later that his comments were torn out of the context and had been cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but you only have a edited version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ es , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks herself : if Abu Nu@@ es , who later worked on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly write homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anian not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , I have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attacks the freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced .
still recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ tic news service took several former governmental orders and members of the teacher firm , with the reason they had expressed themselves on commentary in social media critical about the problems posed with deep in the land ro@@ oting corruption .
given its view , the concert H@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is merely the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to indu@@ ce a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian bar .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has we@@ aving M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks out of slow , attentive and internal changes . it is certain that these changes occur from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , such as millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he dreams not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will move through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , cir@@ cl@@ ashes and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will move further and therefore also res@@ ist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war Dol@@ ls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the ne@@ bul@@ uta Festival .
one suspected that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory asser@@ ted that the for@@ ks , the drums and the spru@@ ces were over a thousand years ago , in the armies of Japan in the northeast mar@@ ched , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I &apos;ve been looking forward to seeing the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two pi@@ v@@ ans are just seen .
however , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival will have the only true - and in addition a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high ceremony was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care are as important as in this story , as they help foster the Peruvian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote an legitimate occupation such as those of the bar@@ ber .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can form these elaborate hair@@ styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Batt@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts at each other to show who of them can create the ec@@ cent@@ rists look like you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice in the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities , do@@ zens of young people have seen that they can grasp a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school had special educational workshops before starting in March , reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because with love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : feeling of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; Liebes@@ message to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love newsletters for people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who make themselves w@@ aning ?
this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) to write young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla letters .
only recently it was a place of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ite F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Columbus ) , which forms the longest @-@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International was applied to the passage of peace agreement than so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but before the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , which lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now be re @-@ integrate into the lives of civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian was convinced that the young Colom@@ bian collap@@ sed and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare - which should then be delivered personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Peace Prize winner , which took place in Bogot@@ á in Bogot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , write in the val@@ entine day of thousands of love , but those forget that they need a lot of unnecessary .
he plane , he continued to share his love with people this year that was most urgent .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; the letters are ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i had never thought that someone would forgive . &apos;
the first 500 letters were transferred to the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC decided on how they had done it earlier in order to face the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of under@@ mining people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; told the policy @-@ knowing Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me by the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare ) saw I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to it was on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ maker , a deadly weapon in the village of the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I responded to a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful , so I responded to it . &quot; then suddenly the tears suddenly come about the che@@ eks .
I looked at it completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life expect@@ edly than War . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting with open arms to us .
until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
in pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion .
the students were all grown up as early as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
therefore the leader of F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years ago we have experienced how the social injustice at the State of the State have experienced us on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to build us a political party , we can help make society more righteous .
for a purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard heard before and have no voting right , and to realize that people who have often seen as a mon@@ ster and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings were turned by their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage could have been given to us and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would rule peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to engage in weapons and prot@@ esting their rights . and that &apos;s also justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology , they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience , that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ash value over the dor@@ man@@ ous LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only made by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual wife of Gros@@ ny who share some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international Head@@ lines after several months after reports published , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic discussed .
the first report was released by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men arrest , and put them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there .
since her childhood she sen@@ sed her that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , you were aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened at Sab@@ rina .
for fear about her life she moved in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as an honorary hero@@ in at a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ ine that hid in trouble .
she had no money , so I accepted her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ sch@@ hen@@ ish friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then I made the pictures of my documents through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a few shopping pieces from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male &apos;s vote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , you give shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had got everything to get started and scre@@ am .
the man was flown .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two keywords in my right im@@ mon@@ ary wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you placed - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there &apos;s still my male name ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , an Cau@@ cas@@ k name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the demanded , to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove that I was left at the top without the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official television , that everything was bad , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people said once my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that did not only hurt your family , but the whole of the Republic .
we can not touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a cor@@ k around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car stood with dark@@ ened shut@@ ters and a numerical sign with a 95 row .
having happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my human right @-@ right @-@ friends check out the numbers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it turned out that I was followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how did you have flown ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I will not award its name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they have really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I just bought them without registering without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
came to and check in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put up the SIM card in my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about , you warmer in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you have your family in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about the sex equation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
some traditional k@@ au@@ tic elements I am still in me .
so much I would like to do so , this psychological barrier can I not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ atting with camera I actually give myself much effort , like the person to look in , that they differ from their past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ sal ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report to Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who imprison@@ ed one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan , there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not closed a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that mean I , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : are now still pregnant men in such secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine say there would be just not very many .
if , then mainly those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives were dropped to face Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are stuck there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be revers@@ ed , one will show off their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ stituted in order to radi@@ alize themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in Ar@@ gun at one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the beard .
there have been nothing new since then .
they have simply taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however until now they were not presented as a banker , there have been no reports so far . but we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who hear a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past .
Sab@@ rina : I had my hair long ago .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was held , I never had problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
Russia was originally calling for the &quot; Civi@@ lization &quot; but finally has us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the P@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were stran@@ ded ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube , and short T@@ ops .
the security officer of Sh@@ aria has never bent me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an expression of speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ice not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children , if they are talking about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never denied me , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this mercy @-@ time stopped ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered into the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he started talking about morality .
he did not talk about us , but mainly about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change .
he who sm@@ iles and had landed g@@ laugh@@ ed you at once with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has ever been wast@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity is now going to go ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
aside from that I still work as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea clubs , arri@@ vals , I gi@@ ite them to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ences .
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I b@@ lossom sugar .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ al@@ ex ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
so Nature is pure , it has nothing to do with religion .
that is just the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya that want to proph@@ es@@ y with foam before the mouth that there are no gay .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians have also what ; on the whole planet there is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant for me to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practiced Muslims , who go into the mosque and fa@@ sten the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
knowing that many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be in person here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ als in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ denial of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dist@@ res@@ sed situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he stems from his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise in@@ capacity for his family , such as Ah@@ med az@@ i rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
one on a YouTube shared video made the moments , after having signed up himself , fixed .
some people managed to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local resources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has appropri@@ ated in August within the Arab Ah@@ med az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ med az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family father who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable of pursuing their families thanks to persecution on the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of those living in Iran live in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livel@@ i@@ hood .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and signed 1925 major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continue to become only slow , and the native population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often the victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi young people rose to 81 % now .
N@@ our Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director @-@ General for Co@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ med Az@@ is who completed a job , which completed elementary school , 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian r@@ ac@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ mor@@ als among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ himi said that especially unemployment has become more serious about unemployment . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z &apos;s new ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since functional and institutions pre@@ fers no Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their pros and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ med az@@ i and to be pret@@ ended as even Arabic names will not be tolerated , as the speaking of Arabic language or carrying Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , which must endure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , beat human rights defen@@ ders alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world watches and takes note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional . &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the C@@ C@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide las@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions when many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all the Femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women nowadays with same education still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to making use of what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to talk on skin colour , on black tran@@ sid@@ ents women , on black tran@@ sid@@ ents women , on black tran@@ sid@@ ents , on black tran@@ sid@@ ents , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists have been silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless , all the agree that women - all women - should come together to stand up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ascend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that it is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist moti@@ vi@@ zed violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin @-@ cities earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are refer@@ enced with a migration background of the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all humans have not any skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , which ref@@ uses to take into account both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and I am no longer struggling to fight my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner def@@ endant 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology , where the black woman in a historical way is a human and margin@@ alized nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs in order to drive their ego@@ cent@@ ric programme .
I will no longer try to put white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to enti@@ ce them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different homes a home and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to release me full of femin@@ ism , and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather obst@@ inate , that is stub@@ born as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres , which we are created for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson &apos;s , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ anism ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves , by creating ourselves in our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because it existed in this paradigm .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither dec@@ eived , yet ignored .

in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers in the region and the impact of pollution in its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the flow that we had lost when I was a child &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ nings in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # refuse entry ) that reports about the threads to women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the persons concerned .
a police mis@@ ab@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their exile , who had become violent toward violent .
since the end of their relationship had some time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do .
as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to abuse , also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved to her ad .
breaking the devil of the violence against women is difficult .
if women at all have to date , they do not generally receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on men that susp@@ end them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all in case of prosecution authorities .
content 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that is nothing sub@@ ju@@ red of Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective realization blows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are actually susp@@ ens@@ ed , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , research for pleasures at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports , but not even to show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the District State Bar 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence . at 70 % of it it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads with the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads 40 % of women said that they were physically challenged , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ mini@@ ster@@ in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually shown only a few of these crimes . &quot; on every woman that will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , are two women who do not do this , &quot; explained by the end of 2014 .
because women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own crime , the prosecution authorities may not be adequately documented how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
alone until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible ini@@ quity and a judicial system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all their former friends .
in the beginning she did not want it , but then after . this should be rep@@ ented for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer accompanied by Carlos . but two years it carried out the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able :
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
if I have read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos that originates from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is bl@@ am@@ bled .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
their wealthy partners managed to convince them to convince them that they were worth@@ less .
then he started to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , at the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it carried out a process against its former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resi@@ stor@@ s and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Gen@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prin@@ ce@@ ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ und@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law considers to explain and harder to explain and harder to pun@@ ish and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legis@@ lat@@ ext was changed in some points , so that the MEPs set out for the law so that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions may be paved , which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and pun@@ ished by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was envisaged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures that have to carry the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just immediately refund the ad and want to receive a safe place to surrender to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient funds to make it available :
in Paraguay it is seen as a part of human relationships .
here a change must take place , that force is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
those in the face of these facts reveals itself guilty and contributes to the cul@@ pr@@ es of the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report such a long time until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . before , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things , a passage was painted , which had called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the passage of reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to take his sacrifice again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered to be a great deal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continue to push up a year after the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked on the homepage of the information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the Forbidden Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he built a year @-@ old prison .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later came back again .
O@@ man has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state that I had set .
since then , he had dressed , apart from his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster Command , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts by security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ecting .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and activists , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its establishment was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces accepted I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; hands of justice . in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to have put pressure on a ruling in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was charged from the ISS and was arrested by the security forces upon arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS hosted the vice @-@ chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite time after the information Minister had given the statement that the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any other way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial began in mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison guards and also ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of the disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the press state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year off@@ ences and money la@@ in at the height of 3000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year employment ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of a information network to the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a damage was set for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the publication of judgment .
the Appe@@ als Court said to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to the prison quarters of his six @-@ month imprisonment . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he could serve his lon@@ gs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Ministry to conclude the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as before attack by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister was issued a statement , with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister sends personally another statement , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the minister introduced a further time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to allow publication of the newspaper again .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been violated in recent times .
for other violations , for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , is the first independent online newspaper of the country to dis@@ continue its operation .
because of the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to give an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go to their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man un@@ hin@@ ders their ri@@ ghtful human rights , and without fear of deliber@@ ations , including court @-@ based Shi@@ ps .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all . this is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site , there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined in the poorest countries in Africa far more serious impacts than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the Central Bank at the Center for research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania where he himself decided on HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ pled health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media on this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. warri@@ or talks as a private one ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
furthermore , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what do you think is the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always be receiver to be instead of ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
Labor@@ atories is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they focus and how can we support development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific education , starting at any age .
the Social Sciences , Computer Sciences , Big Data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of Life as scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often they are limited speed , things to do , and the discern@@ ing access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that articles can only make available to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited the amount of availability and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton bre@@ d in the United States since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ending , the first plant that was cultivated by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 20 years ago Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only through his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ms can get it , borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further for breeding .
the patents g@@ owns not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green , or scrat@@ ched leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cere@@ als or cart@@ oons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert for food safety are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still bre@@ d salad , but meanwhile it takes longer because his work is becoming more and more challenging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a rock @-@ bread in order to p@@ add@@ ling the p@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go to sal@@ ads far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before court , no one can breed any more a new salad of Solomon , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International space station ISS have bre@@ d red tubes in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there it is tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into being to make sure that some plant species and genic agents are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , the U.S. bre@@ eder can commit themselves that others can use seed seeds to use them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only permit others who do their seed , it &apos;s cru@@ ising in order to grow their own varieties , and it does not immediately consult with two aspects prohibited by many plant pat@@ ents or prescribed .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter or only little by growing seed with natural resistance capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the increasingly common mer@@ gers in China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is offered in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way it is bre@@ d in markets like this fruit is threatened .
dietary sou@@ l@@ ity without seed @-@ sovereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others their seed remains freely available . thus , their approach is opposed to patent seeds and plant @-@ characteristics .

Os@@ si Sup@@ ports argue that the future of food supplies are at risk , since the available gen@@ pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which thus is always restricted , un@@ enc@@ ir@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with gene@@ tical variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ons features are protected as intellectual property , thus it is usable for plant breeders either at all or only troubled .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aged plants like wheat has been patented in even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are so bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or color increases up to such , due to which to flour@@ ish in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of Pat@@ ents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by more and more patents . genetic variety is currently more than ever , since the changed conditions are worse by climate change a lot worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ ader in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is set up for the preservation of genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property is other breeders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant @-@ variation innovations promote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection is not in@@ cum@@ bent on innovation , but promotes them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years waiting until a patent pending , certainly there is no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long , to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , that genetic resources always have always been a general good and we should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ars incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton ling@@ erie on the concept to pat@@ enting the plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol land@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si Board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; he that bre@@ d a variety , also bre@@ d his own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for whose cultivation it needs to be necessary , bre@@ d in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very temper@@ ament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without having to survive the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding @-@ garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant @-@ patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I can produce something new with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies .
I need a constant new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent , you can be protected from competition for 20 years , so that in my opinion it is very easy to do . &quot;
while the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept itself now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the center with farmers is working together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organisation Agre@@ ed to an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding is different from country to country , but because of the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent industry , which allowed patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os launched a conference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all east Africa , to learn about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &apos; open source &quot; seeds , &quot; that the organization currently holds a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start shot .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group about ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a combination of aid organisations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . in this it represents the possibility that farmers have the opportunity to play on seeds , share it and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply with food can be ensured .
in the report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is stressed - a link , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is focused on where and how something is cultivated and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make the people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still block the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government broke the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
August , the network released an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remain bt@@ ful in spite of this attack and the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , to pursue these goals , even though it has never been so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these goals . even though it has never been so important to overcome all technical possibilities to overcome the block@@ age and do not pret@@ end . we insist that we continue to fulfil our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , as the authorities over@@ threw the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar , the network of Al J@@ aze@@ era due to the &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site locks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI consists on the blog of the Kolum@@ ba and human rights research Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada did not have access to more in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he does not write for in Egypt websites and media .
now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even aim of attack .
Blo@@ gger , the provider at which also the Zi@@ adas blog is native , but on the other hand it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he reported about the student prot@@ esting and took a video , like the police exercise bodily violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the block@@ age by the government and refle@@ ctive what this means for him :
to lock blogs too is very old , however , has been a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me two reasons :
1 ) It is able to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege condition ; A arrest , a attempted murder , over@@ head at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not have nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only to a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it for the post of articles to get the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ le go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 pages . this took technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , such as orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE has also documented the block@@ age of providers , through the relocation of boarding @-@ sur and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content , which could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cens@@ ors made to be taken behind closed doors , thereby ensuring the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed to the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year old in schools &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; J@@ hin@@ dered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ do@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the B@@ ale 2017 in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian government organisation Global Justice had even called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , published for the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16th August &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision stated the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes which occur in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , etc . everything , which however happened by civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio is published in the category &quot; War in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war British in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war course is distor@@ ted , even if it can be distor@@ ted , atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than it nour@@ ishes ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l is argu@@ ing the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it to call force as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negle@@ ct of public service .
to memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as a &quot; non @-@ violent place in Brazil , &quot; is according to Cec@@ í@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics ranging from 2015 to the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data available .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the toll rates per federal state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; writes them .
extra belongs to the Global Glob@@ o , the biggest media company of South America , which emphasises as Cec@@ í@@ lia , repeatedly called the security policy of the state .
among these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 which is the aim of conqu@@ ering a F@@ av@@ ela to conquer a unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this was actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP has been going to protect the newly created police unit after several reports about Shi@@ ps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor churches which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under accus@@ ation .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is also serious consequences for people after themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to use means and path@@ ways that are typical of a war . this belongs to the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and is the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fro@@ sted balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war went or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police have a mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident has also made head@@ lines : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots that the police had ab@@ stain@@ ed out of a helicopter .

to stay alive : bel@@ ated Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ ber@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the East G@@ out@@ a region is particularly strongly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21st 2013 had called for a century of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have been controlled by re@@ bel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to that local residents have been reli@@ ed on local products or through tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ age traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tainable for large sections of the population .
it teaches a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics the inhabitants of East G@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional , planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their dietary activities makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French message agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that already has been fought for three years to make this project commemor@@ ative and pressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a &apos;s to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to earn donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative depend on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel from plastic used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began to increase their quality from the regions of the regions before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational park for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms throughout the east gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking down the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating in@@ sist@@ ence ( such as paper , tea , coffee breaks , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were in@@ ju@@ red as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government was proclaimed last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
one estimates that there were more than 500 fire@@ places that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June it occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European for@@ estry surveillance system that monitors the forest area by satellite channels , in 2017 alone in Portugal approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst der Location : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017
some from Twitter users divided pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the net :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting actions by the state .
the people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to classi@@ fy the extent of the tragedy as much as possible .
João Sover@@ al from the covenant of farmers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not nowhere : there are d@@ ding reports of open roads , which were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were very late blocked . &quot;
furthermore , building permit in locations with high Bran@@ de@@ ko are questioned .
a widespread proposal to the whale form , which the government had introduced in 2003 and 2005 , was disp@@ uted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a cur@@ sion of the law which had the construction activity if the applicant had to be done by means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; João Al@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly burning wood , itself , as in a devil @-@ circuit , after fires this kind ever further spread .
these problems occur that the website of the Civil Code of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information sought or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João Pina , in order to simplify the work of fire@@ men and was so decisive in October that the server trac@@ ted to the rush of 400@@ ,000 users , who pursued the fires , have not counted the site more than half a million access .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

the conquest of Afghanistan began in one night in the fall of 1994 by the Taliban .
two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would no longer see her son a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn the young should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the leaders of Haz@@ ara , He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ soldier was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and a lot of Haz@@ ara suddenly felt resistant .
the Taliban for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara were increasingly closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . again , he found himself in a foreign country , along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar , which were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood .
at that time today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we suspended n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we cannot er@@ fr@@ ores at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k released his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ts on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy .
some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food to needy children .
it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers can be found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
civil liberties organisation Civil Liber@@ ties for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ er is accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be divided into a entrance center if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which may withdraw after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible life was helped to liber@@ ate A@@ shar@@ k to set themselves out of these conditions soon .
having made several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ k put his total revenue into the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snapshot .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans were created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .

I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all the others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k lubric@@ ated also plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ vatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ oplas@@ tic report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in world right shows
the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a draft law , which pres@@ cribes that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority .
users would have to use to use social networks within six months after the successful legislative decre@@ e on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their identification number .
those who failed to fail this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or to be sentenced to a criminal off@@ ence .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently negotiating the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
may a further dep@@ u@@ ties issued a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or to a high officials .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President and government institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposal , such an act would act with pr@@ isons and money la@@ wing , so far from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he showed violence against demonstr@@ ators , which demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators , who had led to the minister of elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested in the same occurrence , four years imprisonment for a meeting .
recently , his trial was postponed to 20 May , because the prison deri@@ vation according to human rights groups began to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups agree , spot@@ ting of other arms power , illegal assembly , murder and tried murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza made the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary free . they were indi@@ cted for her reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists locked to sc@@ anned documents

this document released on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the pre@@ hen@@ sive plans to support the law@@ suit .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the disclosure of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press release , which secur@@ es journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new regulations of the public office of the Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the regulations it will also indicate that registration with the full re@@ viewer will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st suggest that herein is to be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities are going to apply these rules .
Chinese citizen citizens proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only in order to protect the journ@@ alistic and its independence .

this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organise a list of online services , which will organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and force them on request for the termination of user data .

it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can not stop , jump @-@ up
