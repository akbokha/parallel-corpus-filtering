<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies I have read about American music, American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this land had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year, I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray grantham in The Pelican Letter, a terrible reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud which was the Supreme court with judges who were his interest inclined to occupy.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free from method Man, "me it was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, it is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had reinforced my admiration for the US only.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very snap of love over his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he moves with his mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague has put it, and publicly proclaimed his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroUS and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in shear for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number one ever won by the party nomination candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biggie person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to get into harmony with the people during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply glorious man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Likewise, Trumps worldview does not coincided with the present by Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in finding the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr who fought for life long, and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits her to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser Council helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them have deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During the trust of his way to the nominees of the presidential race, she offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans gave over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man despite - or perhaps because of his contempt toward non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlooked these things, broke me nearly the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters to racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To put human beings, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not considered by the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of which are white, for Trump, because they would like to regain control over a country they disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "sticking of the White against all other ethnicities"; wording of white in reference to the White and whiplash, which means as much as Schskid trauma) as it called the great Van Jones, has made exactly what America has done so magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyman whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with plurality, freedom of religion, and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is on the rod, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "brood the quantity." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no! they called them and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocile "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God be praised that Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new country.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycling Instruments" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music-school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very narrow connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 odometer south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds far from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) in the village: one of children and adults-acting Symphony Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome them with their music instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students is a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs-abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth always offered a rare Hoffman.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, mean the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You come and play with shiny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongo and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made from reportable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the fall into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitifs, violas, Celli, double-bass, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets and percussion, which were all produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire covers classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local oecologist and musician instructor the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage - children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one from trash asked violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the poorest people - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played Pope Francis in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated in Lebanese waters illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus well-driven and little inclined to welcome a legislative crushter of this kind on its shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorers, Mozambique and the Seychelles is rapidly mobilized against the ship. they dared to give him one of their ports and soak himself to give him a fishing headage.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply spend everything" "", "Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of looting of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, regulates criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegale Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information out and stand up each other, where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated via definition: what is caught, is hidden, but due to it is extremely difficult to trace. therewith, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the obvious disregard to existing laws, by which certain habitats and ways are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm that a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, with the information between individual countries, so the actions happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port of port.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of vessels even very attentive when they move on the open sea through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible to mark the authorities, ships who fish in the Forbidden City. also, so suspects rides - some those who indicate that a ship loads his fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the ships involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can be based on this information then the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not sell their charge to their charge. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is a significant financial loss to the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD on lost sales to win over the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats which attracts the area of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such practices include as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, indicating fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they targeted the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-organised control system" "", "says Long." "" "sooner a ship could not flically flically and a country could then say 'You dared not walk my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'Komm to me'. and exactly this legal banghole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i had participated in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed crime networks who have distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities used and it has found winged boats and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our tests lead us quite far into organised crime of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is to help FISH-i to be diluted ships by precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, will also help you to hide the illegal ships that likes to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and this is trying to cross through cross," says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support offers.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Marine Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by means of which the position of every single traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that simply gives sense," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite themselves and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a globes system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only sense of criminals, but they also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were used earlier without a licence and hardly expected with consequences, now they know they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now reached a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats and more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to expand Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing networks whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing every year." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries together in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. also they are fighting for illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "with certainty, the goal of even more such initiatives and structures can also arise in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member countries would report from his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship, which was on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time proof that such special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world-sea.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the outcome of the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat region of Barinas, in the Andes-regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central-north Bundestag Carabobo and at Isla Margarita at the federal state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorated continuously, which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the Opposition saw in the term of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; ultimately, however, the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-operation at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the type of government in their latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate and spices of food and medicine is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extended lack of food and medicine, the referendum held a chance to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocity in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the Cordoba province of Cordoba, Quijano said in the province of CÃ³rdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano does not have chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting in the office, the same names as his father carry up to the brutal military permutations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salesmagent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendimeriebeamter. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Chairman of the Secret Army 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who spoke before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To transfer, one needs two important skills: passive voice skills to understand the output text, and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case by native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the address language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">The English language learner should translate from English to French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue, who could customize translations into English. this may be lacking in comprehension, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who themselves have no foreign employees, have translation nevertheless company internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose British knowledge are considered to be the best brought to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The puzzled and puzzling propositions resulting from machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a long time of human translator. this applies to some languages particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange official English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least innocuous. but by large companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>

<seg id="460">Alvarenga has worked in the house of her employer Alvarenga between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example, she clears the fridge, putzte the living room, polished the furniture and descripfied the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to hunger, but was also not uncommon. "I was allowed to bring more books out of the library of the landlord as eating out of the refrigerator," she remembered.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings of the host Alvarenga, in addition to standing and editorial from oppositionings such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He held them for intelligent, but did not work with her. "the host had someone found who he listened, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I wanted to learn" bad habits. "so they said that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of the Guarantee, to return home again their native convocation.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation, which she had made her to lose again, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything she was paid from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminated. "a thing about which almost never is spoken, bullying and the rakangards are exposed to those cries when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have parents, they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents, a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was able to invite anyone to my home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time, where friendships arise, I particularly felt that I was not part of a group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The insulation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="487">The ad got five "lifts" and a lot of comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ãemby wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ãemby, offered her 15-year niece. "she likes small children and is very pretty," wrote them.</seg>
<seg id="490">The third comment was written by "a girl from the country's interior who wants to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the fibers intercepted into the display once again:</seg>

<seg id="502">"" "sixteen Egyptian parliamentaries have recently voted on a bill on" "" "the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is adopted by the Parliament, the users and users of social media must register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "based on the law would then be a place set up, which is commissioned to use citizens to use their permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the Act, users and users would have to register on the website of the site with their right names and personal numbers, in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it failed to do this, so that a penalty could bring up to six months in prison or a busty.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six Paragrafen and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt records, defines social media as "any application that is running through the internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed, as the draft is not able to impose on how Egyptian authorities are to create the user's users and users the registration. unclear is also how they make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and promoters of the legal situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password "to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>

<seg id="512">Experts on the ground are sceptical with regard to the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior researchers") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strong on technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with things to do with technology.</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's mandate and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not, the draft "represents in line with a pro-military thought-art in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and ensured that no deviating foration on the image is present," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the Tierschutzerin Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the witty Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which belong through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). overall, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat, and since they are still less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard the only surviving carnation in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the eco-system also depends on the fact that a large carver is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat at the camera all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As well-educated biologs, Raza is passionate about another side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in research studies with wildly living animals and in educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017 documented, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "Trinity catastrophe" of March 2011. a vast earthquake, tsunami and a atom accident in Fukushima disaster had triggered disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a eterious prefecture of Japan, northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring generation of Fukushima and Iwata were forced to cut off, because the tsunami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still, the Prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo report shows which progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese reestablished authority as well as survey results of the person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement cottage (Iarians, Requai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwk.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success under the three prefecture was Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement centers were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwata has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is formed by 70 percent in the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one is still trying to relocate six years after the catastrophe, Evacuity of Beheluilding (Iarians, cascetsu juutaku) in final substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima still live in emergency, while in emergency, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated goods, which were rebuilt after the disaster in Behelarrivals, were renovated in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwata the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could identify, have 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the unbelieving, its doors down to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefecture is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fisherorts have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have drawn large-scale in the three prefecture of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear unfailing, since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerands by Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefests itself, tourism has resumed again and again, but here Fukushima still remains downcast far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwata are back to 90 percent at the same stand, as before the misfortune. Fukushima on the other hand can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is harder to feel their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To find an overall picture, the newspaper introduced numerous polls among the local population and under the evacuated by. they asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sensation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey took that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents are found that still not enough in matters of disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the Prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has raised their attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessed the worst, catastrophic, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated Fukushima from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to territories outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23 000 people were renamed back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated areas are still alive, older than 50 years old. they have to compete in proper accommodation projects, because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwata and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. this is construction projects that part of the Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="627">The Municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the western cuban province of Mayabeque is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no noteworthy sugar harvests locally.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar beet factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the creation, the sugar cane of sugar in the region was quiet, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the smells from steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others designate and commuting daily to factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which stands every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugarbeet industry does not smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar beet factories in the east of the sugar beet factories that have been in operation after a long inactive time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene sharpened exactly to have heard that in MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarment industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounting to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive to concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad stories are already no news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbeet industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train station of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar raw materials was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were inviable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production purpose was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, the sugar for a maximum of four Centavos (0.03 Euro) can produce.</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the chance rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose about a decade ago.</seg>

<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>

<seg id="692">Adolescents from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour have been launched directly to schools and youth centers for 2014 workshop, youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educating David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree Communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases that the young participants come in talks like "cultural identity, language, dispute, love, self-acceptance" or whatever of them come into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the kite daily, for example, the history of the Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to impart how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received something from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like I would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what the Creator has determined</seg>

<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacturing of these plastic hosts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that just produce those plastic courts, which was documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic hosts are usually found that they are not even closer to them. however, a new trend will transform them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matte, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic surgeries deformed mobile ligaments, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned to kitschy and objects as in this case, cooled cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuk refrigerators for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences becomes increasingly ascending.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a caste-don was turned (a popular travel bowl with seafood) into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part is made for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch like an apple, with a candle for the phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing excursion into strange.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-cheated, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can put my mobile phone with salmon-cheated?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in Plasticated can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile-stands has the form of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More Corsical plastic meals can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the serving the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokul sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) will be great if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that is, when they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid to have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insensitivity of men is incredible for me if death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they were "inflated."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to admit, that they will be spared of such tragedies when they are not touching and quiet.</seg>

<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of morality to the public safety and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. uncovered) attempts to offer language inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (as the famous Portuguese suck) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists stubbornly for any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for quite a while in an on-line list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist von "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwottage language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Do you think about your parents in recognition of how to make you effort in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsreq language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the convenience or laziness which you feel after getting ripped in cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defences other cultures, revealing other thought cords and awakens our new earth.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site still want to publish more of these "unbridgeable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is a possible response in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has already carried out events, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass of mass of languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that incorporate diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to be associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "during" "" "listening is often related to understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to" "" "to feel to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers put their story first in their own language and translate, or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, so carry out their dedication and depiction that the audience can be aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou consate also the opportunity to explain the customs of narratives for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the navel from the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having declared the meaning of his navel, John Nyamusara will be asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very happy with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can arrange with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available here licence-free, contains a number of attempts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, researchers and authors who have involved in the movements for free knowledge, have side on side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something meaning from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, beloved, beloved, and celebrating internet volunteers who is detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison, where he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back into his normal life and in freedom immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us begin to start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developers for open source and digital activist has been in prison for Open Source and digital activist since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra-prison, a non-military facility to an infamous place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Attortin Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel reported on the basis of one as" strictly secret "drawn command of the military geridoo from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and made them aware of a alleged death prize against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and momentary of leaders of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of baseline cultural prototype predictive as the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the cross-cross of many civilizations, and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with hiesky traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after having started working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time-capsule which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Yet, Bassel was not able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call up his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught other instilling to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He carried me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also included other inders as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having held them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waste), a promoter that she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Basle and Noura have worked together for a year together on the book.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambicans reacted with anger in a corrupt, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other defendants was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for suspicion of 54 million metical (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called his reinstatement to the company, what happened on 19 April in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor generacy of the Republic, which had evaluated the motion, there would be no barriers to Cambaza to re-return to his old position, as the company has no disciplinarity after his custody.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not have the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, briefly CIP), a local institution that uses public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to retire the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have a disciplinarity against the contrasting thought.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently pleaded and led no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambian social media, this behavior also leans off and considers the case as "resellers":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to prison and took half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and to polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become reintegrated into the company he helped to add harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is willing to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resists!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambians and Student of Political Science in Brazil says, the director said no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he radiate him I can not believe that someone has rewarded someone in such way that the state has already massively insulted so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead have only served themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as hand to get an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man has become tired, who was sentenced and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly speaking, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmical word "Kalar PAE" means hereditary or spherical.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well known social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although about the origin of the word still is discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook Armed the word "Kalar" or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely low connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in trying to fight a speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not automatically called a hate language automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the purpose of his usage.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar PAE '(splashse),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarka '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends has been deleted today, because he enthuses the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a witty way whether he could catch his back pain, he made a word of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set of ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that it will reduce a speech of radial nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it extinguishers all posts linked to the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatic is not understood what you write on Facilook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the words below.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(splasbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "the good is that this three-legged nationalists spread the hate language, a fairly good lesson." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone, to spread the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy might not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often is a pair and mouse game, whereby users can use social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use post, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the Post" "" "Facebook community" "" "was not addressed" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or they simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate-speaking radialists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office has been removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Aging such words will only bring even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "furthermore it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "hernia curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to report the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of lots of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make things funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch heredicurry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "only to check whether Facebook contains the post office, which contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1343">The monogamy is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously decided to establish a law which aims to ban this practice, so that the universal age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the Act, some members held undualistic and Muslim religious communities on the practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interfere, because that, age does not determine the maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago, and 18 percent were 8.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical Central Office of the country showed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social-media movements, who tried to create laws for the child before, followed by the foot and pleasing their great support. undoubtedly, they halted them to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's before, they should not look after their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition only sort of tension in this actually incomplicated thing, and at some point, there were doubts as to whether the opposition would disagree with the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against the child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of opposition and an independent, that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority could make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now it is necessary to agree with the President of the country and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update, which reads Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against child before was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 voices and no one on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of social media users was enthralled because the laws were finally changed to the children's before." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-Member Lovell Francis, who was appointed Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary just needed that the core of the matter has disappeared, but do you know what? the toe is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of opinion, it was definitely long enough to run the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which listens to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, which was quite openly talking about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The heir Age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amending the Act was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present during the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1390">Using the mirrors of web pages, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was represented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than a month now Turkey tarried the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day is clearer how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information and to share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series wedge up against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technician internet users are used to use circumstacking tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has posted an article of Wikipedia, such as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held, regular rectionings of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform completes all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer machine connections), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia) we put everything that snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the site www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also reminded that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to get the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansipinn.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigradii - Global Voices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigradii's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy from a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One picks up to another URL that is not the original one. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server heads the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when myself called Navaruraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side, where the leopard was and I immediately started to snub!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so awful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he stood tigers already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can be disturbing from the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>

<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Bucky appeared. he immediately moves, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation (ite.: I clicked for Environmental Protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Neptune and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to make in the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the greatest care to address the names of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned to the Indian State Odisha, condemned by a hypocrisy and chased by her family and the village community after they had made an unmarried relative.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not called by men, is also widely spread among men. however, they have far less presumptions to fear, if at all, what, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, occurred nine women, among them health staff as well as housewives, a unique club and were quickly became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and supports the reduction of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the revealing of practices, like children's heaters up to the abandonment of HIV- and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of the change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion, was the case of women who did not call their husbands with their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the discussion on the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the name of her husband does not" "" "utterance" "" "is a bread that they have been fully maintained and never questioned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this, is regarded as sneakening, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning was Rohini, who had never called her husband, who had never called his name at home as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the baggage Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round raw ini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, angry, affectionate, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then, they asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husband, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the break of an ancient tradition, in which married women could never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had just before him throughout the practice; another chose to allow the whole of frustration to him and his family by curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush along with an ancient bris also broken, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call her husband in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another clubmember decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-in-law she became scared, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding, and the situation began in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanic red point on the forehead, which indicates the divorce:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred point if he also acts.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He was laughed only and I heard that to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely abandoned, but think they are in a better position to choose themselves, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion during each discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want to make sure the women make sure who what could hear," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in her life they celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced, and were talking about things about whom they had never thought of thought.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working with these problems for so many years and yet I have been linked to some things, for example how our identities have been linked to our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to it, no matter how small they appear.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken only Saris since her marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a broad shirt over a pants, wear; they did not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion on the merits of own clothes, morals linked to the Saris and much more, graceful Rohini their own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided now to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion I had changed a little, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming up in rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and are not any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women now contribute to any time in Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the flanges for more freedom of movement or their own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigating the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also like this.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this prub gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain of chain when every woman goes home in the club and other people of it reported what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men in the district Milange were killed, a few kilometers from border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently stressed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It give the local superstitions that the head of a glass-piece of gold could bring gold enthouble or wealth, explained the polzeisprecher by ZambÃ©zia to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that we have registered the following attacks on extra-scale men in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group that is the goal of murder for obscure purposes are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to that the UN 2016 held a mission in the South African country to examine these Praktik.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in neighboring countries of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shaman is involved in the death of the glaring men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of glitudinal individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, for presumably higher rituals, has given cultural motives and is considered by the traditional shamans into consideration (PRM), which also indicates that a belief existed, according to which the victims in the head would have power, the wealth generated.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that probably was recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney ended at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," after joining the Charter of the Charter, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China was involved.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as" "" "an internal business" "", "and a spokesman told, he said it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to call on the international community to release the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet, Liu Xia, or allow him to have a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pointer Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissar of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into Stole, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government taught that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year. only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon in China, since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news was circulated that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to its adherence, he was not able to counter his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for the release of Lius on the same day as she told us in a statement on 30 June.</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all the limitations of Mr Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad shared with that the Americans" "" "wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad, in so far as it was with his help." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message of the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities, not only to release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia of their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The challenge of the U.S. Embassy attracted an angry response from China after themselves, with the utterance of the State Department that "no country has the right to interfere with and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as free movement and access to medical care of its choice on which they claim to be according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing to Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadowed the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked to provide appropriate medical care available to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Anwalt told AFP previously that Lius wife, Liu Xia that could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Liu with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum is talking about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada demands China, its international human rights, including freedom of expression, to uphold and release the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry proposed to release China in a Declaration on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he, regardless of where, is needed. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France Info already reported that the French government of Liu would welcome in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of solid affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Liu and call for a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Party Party, China also called on to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to let themselves deal with Taiwan in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed itself very worried in a statement on 28 June around Liu and gave us that many have asked him to pray for lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished, to a harmonious, stable and prosperous whose China would have contributed to a more peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly as Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the Blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the International branches of the Association of New York, the Ministers agreed that many people have criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He appreciates that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we may be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice" "" "to turn its logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land, you will say that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had a breach of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, Whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons made by Shangraceam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one can't measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore is compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers to be forward, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers were given in the last week of Shangrgam responses to his American guests with regard to our press, our youth-dictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarded with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls the Shangrgam to clear his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city is, the country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our precious K Shangrat would take the effort to clear this point unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By pointing on the blog his comment, he points concerning the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co-ordinance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He forested Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party long ago?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he has obviously not meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am beyond what the judicial Minister of Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old gards, what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it correctly and become aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review disappearances the spots of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shangraceam "truthful a mistake" or was it a Freudscher instructor?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Intergovernmental Panel, the statements of Mr Shanmugam is of hardest importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the rulers have their military service, defend it only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom should our Prime Minister withdraw invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel tracks?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Referenced the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed a lot of ambition...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a town / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "defense of the country" "", "etc." "" "but this is not quite true." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">At my clear position then usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, Nature." many Canadians cook maybe inwardly before anger, when they are held for Americans, but me doesn't bother.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All Love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand...</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, prior to the invasion of Iraq and 11 September.</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: being called "nett," is basically to be stunningly - just like the good-natured, gentle, but fully-significant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpson" (who has its own Canadian double-pedestrians).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around a round.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even as far as going to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main peculiar of Canadians is.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band has released a music video which took over the Junta which took power in 2014 and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government, continue to governs the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers directly to the continued military dominance of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to express the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was great success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, it was shared on Facebook uploaded to Facebook 1,254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The Dictator was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists open the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persecuted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the Draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which has given the ruler's absolute decision-making power over important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program for "setup change" by journalist, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are regarded as critics by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vage and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army was also established, which surveyed online content and persons, which are predominant, the monarchy is forged to have prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a stripped gestures against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic Convention).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 the war was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a putsch of the army.</seg>

<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011 the total population of the district has risen 16,000 people after over a decade.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillenstriell and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars a night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with large stocking walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells the people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is quite quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on Karton.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>

<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "mum Africa is a known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans are often travelling together the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp from Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for months: he has sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>

<seg id="1933">She explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez might be very well known, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family were included in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold for too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time indoors: sometimes he lodges to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, every now and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine inhaled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which was one of them since 1967; the year in which Israel did its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not restricted in its mind by limits, and he can feel co-ordinated according to his own statement, who under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he puts a special disinclination against US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, to do anything with his identity as the Palestinian refugees of the second generation, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own life conditions so" "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured out in water off NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also states that public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sening hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking the gap of warm coffee and the sweep of the kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost by freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as in the public during the Ramadan water to drink - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the interior of the Ministry of Jordan has canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentaries who support the Islamic Action Plan - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual, Hamed sensuo, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The S & D spokesperson in the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "has been canceled" due to the sexual orientation of the garment.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim to prove the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world, whether the old-proven legitimacy from authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila said the jordan people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be quite simply silently rhetoric, but in fact a clear and crystallable reality in Jordan reflect that in Haibs work clearly appears.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender standards become faint by having his vision of the fate of Arab women formed the pre-elike sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly formed unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, the number of "volunteers" has increased the inofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its climax; however, Jordan is still lacking that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of morality or domestic violence to provide adequate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breaking struggle from 1954, women who are exposed to intra-family violence in 1954, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Haibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also do not shy away from themes that are long in his country as tableu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib retreach that his work is politically, however, that he cannot separate his music, the full of explicit approaches to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became a policy dreamed, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "lies the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want "- be it faith or failure, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on equality by LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored up to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya to mention later that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but you only have a edited version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nues, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks herself: if Abu Nues, who later worked on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly write homosexuality, why can Jordanian not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, I have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attacks the freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Still recently, in January 2017, the jordtic news service took several former governmental orders and members of the teacher firm, with the reason they had expressed themselves on commentary in social media critical about the problems posed with deep in the land rooting corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given its view, the concert Haib's opinion is merely the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to induce a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian bar.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has weaving Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks out of slow, attentive and internal changes. it is certain that these changes occur from day to day at the heart of the jordanic society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, such as millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreams not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will move through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, circlashes and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will move further and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the nebuluta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspected that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory asserted that the forks, the drums and the spruces were over a thousand years ago, in the armies of Japan in the northeast marched, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: feeling of love to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the paper "Liebesmessage to guerrilla warfare" which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love newsletters for people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who make themselves waning?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went out to the two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) to write young people to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently it was a place of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerite FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Columbus), which forms the longest-point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "International was applied to the passage of peace agreement than so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, which lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now be re-integrate into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society again, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla warfare, it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian was convinced that the young Colombian collapsed and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warfare - which should then be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Peace Prize winner, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in BogotÃ¡. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, write in the valentine day of thousands of love, but those forget that they need a lot of unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued to share his love with people this year that was most urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and establish a new life. "the letters are ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i had never thought that someone would forgive. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred to the Caldono region in the Caldono region in the Caldono region in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC decided on how they had done it earlier in order to face the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of undermining people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different emotions you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between," told the policy-knowing Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me by the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla warfare) saw I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to it was on the bed was a MGL-Granatmaker, a deadly weapon in the village of the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke to him and asked," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "I answered," "" "I responded to a letter that someone has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful, so I responded to it. "then suddenly the tears suddenly come about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I looked at it completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life expectedly than War. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">In prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as early as war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leader of FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years ago we have experienced how the social injustice at the State of the State have experienced us on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to build us a political party, we can help make society more righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard heard before and have no voting right, and to realize that people who have often seen as a monster and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings were turned by their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage could have been given to us and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">"" "" "" "the Colombian was prophesied that peace would rule peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to engage in weapons and protesting their rights. and that's also justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we at FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology, they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience, that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2248">The first report was released by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspected queer men arrest, and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a Monster to the World"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grosny, and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she sensed her that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, you were aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group Chetschenen was experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened at Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear about her life she moved in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as an honorary heroin at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a Transine that hid in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I accepted her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his tschhenish friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then I made the pictures of my documents through the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was just doing a few shopping pieces from the backseat of my car, I heard a male's vote:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned, I feel something in my body, but I did nothing hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence but this time on Chechen:" "" "how long do you still want to honor the family, you give shame?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything to get started and scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two keywords in my right immonary wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse were you placed - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there's still my male name; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, an Caucask name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded, to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove that I was left at the top without the streets; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official television, that everything was bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rbchensize C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said once my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world that did not only hurt your family, but the whole of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a cork around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car stood with darkened shutters and a numerical sign with a 95 row.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">"" "" "" "my human right-right-friends check out the numbers" "" "signs" "" "- it turned out that I was followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I will not award its name, but I will say that I remember them all; they have really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I just bought them without registering without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and check in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put up the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not think about, you warmer in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you have your family in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about the sex equation, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kautic elements I am still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I would like to do so, this psychological barrier can I not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera I actually give myself much effort, like the person to look in, that they differ from their past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed dorsal?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who imprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That mean I, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still pregnant men in such secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine say there would be just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then mainly those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives were dropped to face Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are stuck there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be reversed, one will show off their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically substituted in order to radialize themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in Argun at one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself as these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"" "" "" "however until now they were not presented as a banker, there have been no reports so far. but we suspect that such actions are quite possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who hear a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I had my hair long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already familiar to Grosny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was held, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally calling for the "Civilization" but finally has us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Paria law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stranded; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube, and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security officer of Sharia has never bent me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an expression of speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spice not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children, if they are talking about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never denied me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this mercy-time stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered into the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he started talking about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but mainly about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiles and had landed glaughed you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has ever been wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity is now going to go?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Aside from that I still work as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea clubs, arrivals, I giite them to the hospital and help them to get essences.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I blossom sugar.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hidalex?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So Nature is pure, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is just the same as Chechnya that want to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there are no gay.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the Kabardiner have which, the Russians have also what; on the whole planet there is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, that's why it is unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims, who go into the mosque and fasten the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Knowing that many think of transience to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be in person here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he stems from his own helplessness that can arise incapacity for his family, such as Ahmed azi rights groups, who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on a YouTube shared video made the moments, after having signed up himself, fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to clear the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local resources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of those living in Iran live in the Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took over power and signed 1925 major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continue to become only slow, and the native population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victims of untreated diseases, hunger and hardships.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people rose to 81% now.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director-General for Cooperative, Work and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of the Ahmed Azis who completed a job, which completed elementary school, 55% a secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with the feminism, even with the intersectional."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide lasi and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions when many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all the Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women nowadays with same education still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to making use of what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to talk on skin colour, on black transidents women, on black transidents women, on black transidents, on black transidents, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but nevertheless, all the agree that women - all women - should come together to stand up" "" "to ascend" "" "their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my lord's" "" "to achieve the equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that it is in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalised form of racist motivized violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin-cities earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referenced with a migration background of the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all humans have not any skin colour of the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join me as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, which refuses to take into account both the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I am no longer struggling to fight my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner defendant 1851 in her speech:" "" "I'm not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology, where the black woman in a historical way is a human and marginalized nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings which also absorbing our customs and customs in order to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to put white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to entice them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different homes a home and limit themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release me full of feminism, and join the movement of the Womanism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather obstinate, that is stubborn as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women for our own ideas and move into the spheres, which we are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson's, the author of the book Africana womananism (about: Africa-Womanismus: how we can defend ourselves, by creating ourselves in our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even spiritual elements can be revered that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because it existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither deceived, yet ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police misabar said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their exile, who had become violent toward violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship had some time passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another wife Balbuena due to abuse, also the acute display of Ada BÃ¡ez is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the devil of the violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women at all have to date, they do not generally receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on men that suspend them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all in case of prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 strokes and Statistiken2 Unvisible Missions and a legal system that is nothing subjured of Paraguay laws: good approach, defective realization blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are actually suspensed, Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, research for pleasures at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports, but not even to show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the District State Bar 9600 ads went on for domestic violence. at 70% of it it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads with the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence in the peace of peace. also here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said that they were physically challenged, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenministerin Ana Baiardi are actually shown only a few of these crimes. "on every woman that will be reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who reimbursed for physical abuse, are two women who do not do this, "explained by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime, the prosecution authorities may not be adequately documented how many women are murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want it, but then after. this should be repented for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer accompanied by Carlos. but two years it carried out the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women, because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that originates from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is blambled.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I think") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partners managed to convince them to convince them that they were worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias, at the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It carried out a process against its former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the paraguayan Parliament which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Prince).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiundaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law considers to explain and harder to explain and harder to punish and harder to punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislatext was changed in some points, so that the MEPs set out for the law so that the way for decriminalisation of abortions may be paved, which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and punished by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was envisaged, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedures that have to carry the victims of violence at present themselves, if they just immediately refund the ad and want to receive a safe place to surrender to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds to make it available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay it is seen as a part of human relationships.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all. this is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site, there are two reasons: for a lack of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined in the poorest countries in Africa far more serious impacts than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2595">A postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania where he himself decided on HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the sampled health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. warrior discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and misunderstandings of the media on this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. warrior talks as a private one).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sampled national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always be receiver to be instead of ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">Rw: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">Rw: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratories is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">Rw: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should they focus and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">Rw: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The Social Sciences, Computer Sciences, Big Data, research of the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of Life as scientists in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often they are limited speed, things to do, and the discerning access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that articles can only make available to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited the amount of availability and speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredending, the first plant that was cultivated by NASA Astronauts in space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"" "" "" "nearly 20 years ago Morton's work was done only through his own ingenuity and the question how many salms can get it, borders." ""</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents gowns not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green, or scratched leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartoons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert for food safety are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representatives of a millennia old tradition, Morton still bred salad, but meanwhile it takes longer because his work is becoming more and more challenging.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like being in a river a rock-bread in order to paddling the paddling." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go to salads far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before court, no one can breed any more a new salad of Solomon, because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International space station ISS have bred red tubes in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there it is tested, whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being to make sure that some plant species and genic agents are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, the U.S. breeder can commit themselves that others can use seed seeds to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeder only permit others who do their seed, it's cruising in order to grow their own varieties, and it does not immediately consult with two aspects prohibited by many plant patents or prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Board member, Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter or only little by growing seed with natural resistance capacity.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg" "" "stresses that the" open-source "" "" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the increasingly common mergers in China and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is offered in August and September 2016, should also know that the way it is bred in markets like this fruit is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary soulity without seed-sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others their seed remains freely available. thus, their approach is opposed to patent seeds and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supports argue that the future of food supplies are at risk, since the available genpool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which thus is always restricted, unencirable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetical variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartons features are protected as intellectual property, thus it is usable for plant breeders either at all or only troubled.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaged plants like wheat has been patented in even bigger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or color increases up to such, due to which to flourish in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of Patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by more and more patents. genetic variety is currently more than ever, since the changed conditions are worse by climate change a lot worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Spreader in Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is set up for the preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that the intellectual property is other breeders, since" "" "patents and protection of plant-variation innovations promote." "" "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection is not incumbent on innovation, but promotes them by providing the public more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years waiting until a patent pending, certainly there is no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long, to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton, however, that genetic resources always have always been a general good and we should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetars incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton lingerie on the concept to patenting the plant-characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>

<seg id="2675">For Carol landpe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi Board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "he that bred a variety, also bred his own values in it.</seg>

<seg id="2678">While some moderate-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without having to survive the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2682">I need a constant new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years, "says he." with a patent, you can be protected from competition for 20 years, so that in my opinion it is very easy to do. "</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent industry, which allowed patents on conventional plants.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still block the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government broke the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network released an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remain btful in spite of this attack and the remuneration of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, to pursue these goals, even though it has never been so important as now. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these goals. even though it has never been so important to overcome all technical possibilities to overcome the blockage and do not pretend. we insist that we continue to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, as the authorities overthrew the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and that from Qatar, the network of Al Jazeera due to the "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site locks to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI consists on the blog of the Kolumba and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada did not have access to more in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he does not write for in Egypt websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to deal with the censors of the Egyptian government, even aim of attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider at which also the Ziadas blog is native, but on the other hand it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards, while he reported about the student protesting and took a video, like the police exercise bodily violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the blockage by the government and reflective what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs too is very old, however, has been a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is able to convey to me the feeling of a siege condition; A arrest, a attempted murder, overhead at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not have nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it for the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mule go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 pages. this took technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE has also documented the blockage of providers, through the relocation of boarding-sur and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content, which could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened that the censors made to be taken behind closed doors, thereby ensuring the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed to the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year old in schools" "", "Jhindered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe rob pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Ludoafee to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government organisation Global Justice had even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "in this way, published for the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on 16th August" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which they announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision stated the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes which occur in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, etc. everything, which however happened by civilized standard and what only happened in Rio is published in the category "War in Rio. (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the Editor-chief of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war British in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war course is distorted, even if it can be distorted, atrocities of the police that only shoots and then ask questions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" more than it nourishes?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil is arguing the journalist of CecÃ­lia Oliveira against it to call force as "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education, and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as a "non-violent place in Brazil," is according to CecÃ­lia false: "22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics ranging from 2015 to the north and north-east of the country. these are the most current data available.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Global Globo, the biggest media company of South America, which emphasises as CecÃ­lia, repeatedly called the security policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 which is the aim of conquering a Favela to conquer a unit permanently there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this was actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, the UPP has been going to protect the newly created police unit after several reports about Ships and repressions against the poor churches which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under accusation.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux made from one of his articles from 2010, where he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio is also serious consequences for people after themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2873">The conquest of Afghanistan began in one night in the fall of 1994 by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groupings which had conquered the short-term pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At this time, Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara in the province of Ghazni in Central afghanistan, for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say it then, she knew that she would no longer see her son a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn the young should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the leaders of Hazara, Hezb-e-Wahsoldier was just murdered by the Taliban and a lot of Hazara suddenly felt resistant.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban for their hatred of the Hazara were increasingly closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coherence. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. again, he found himself in a foreign country, along with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, which were heavier than he himself, to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "recalled Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite, where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows, so that we cannot erfrores at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark released his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and strants on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application, Ashark came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food to needy children.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers can be found in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Civil liberties organisation Civil Liberties for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seeker is accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centers." "" "this is improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be divided into a entrance center if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which may withdraw after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible life was helped to liberate Ashark to set themselves out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having made several years of working in the construction sector, Ashark put his total revenue into the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snapshot.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis's success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (german: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghans were created, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "Asharafs objectives range far beyond the Italian gastronomers and retail outlets and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teenager." ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all the others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark lubricated also plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservatives." "" "in this way, they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "says he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf made this journey itself. well, he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
