this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because it won as a New York Times re@@ porter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA / Ph@@ ones of Americans have heard .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA is literally dra@@ fts to Iran for an atomic bom@@ b .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapters have not liked ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 10 years , the government has been determined against re@@ isen and called upon it to call its alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and to defeat journalists .
according to First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish the secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they give .
so when the government was crow@@ ned with R@@ isen , he did something that many coura@@ geous re@@ porter already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although she had years for years that it would be imperative for their fall , the demands of the government were dropped by re@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and springs can always hide less .
rather than to fail and ration@@ ally to make statements , this could also take care of their digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone calls are secre@@ tly concerned ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even travel instructions with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA Whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens supposed source to condemn .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his attack . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of having a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the media work on the game that should be protected by the first constitu@@ tionally , because the government has more and more possibilities to put all off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent@@ ing the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can write it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the follow @-@ up , in the testimony .
today , there are communication software that has not yet been written as a re@@ isen book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source batch conversion system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet ar@@ tery , which was developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation when I work , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the one here the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with every ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server in which only the respective message agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secre@@ tion , and many of the information that she would ask , would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that hin@@ ders us all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important to us to ensure that not only technology bur@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to get distr@@ action . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the alarm will tell about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers humble and will report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental mit@@ er , the alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a pilgri@@ m insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest datas@@ he@@ ck of the story published . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ans Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ itness on a statement . &#93; this week we were sent out news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and Law@@ yers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works .
this has already resulted in the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has come back .
also , there are reports that a bel@@ lows of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad envelope in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollar leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s plant@@ ations , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and the next revealing documents .
now sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we see what happened ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all of its taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this applies to all of us .
for my organisation , Global W@@ itness , this disclosure are phenomenal .
all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and entr@@ ust their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function .
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ ka .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commandments .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there were no prominent Americans before in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ ks Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a datas@@ he@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , it needs less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed the employee from the deb@@ tor to rip off school children .
it has been sc@@ amm@@ ers allowed to di@@ pping particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global W@@ itness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent an un@@ covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really sho@@ cked us that everyone was up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator &apos;s suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ voc@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course not handed over money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer made by our co@@ vert investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not about a single peak of leaders , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , established by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound utter@@ ly practi@@ sing , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but when born , I see quite sure that some things began to change .
in the last couple of years we have seen sor@@ ties to more transparency which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has captured in central regi@@ sters at a national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging over here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revelations , this enormous insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global W@@ itness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the proj@@ ectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work out to end this type of in@@ consistency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally end .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red ma@@ Maz@@ ow@@ es .
one day after I finished my trial studies , I made a back@@ ho@@ on sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where did you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
must I now offer a sleeping place ?
but I just didn &apos;t know it just before ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I will not kidn@@ apped in the luggage room of the Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a balloon . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh husband ! what have I made me ?
a wild alien is in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I got out of the bed , on the tenth to the door , and my sleeping @-@ room enclosed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me is now in his class@@ rooms . he is a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on my air mattresses became normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make a short walk , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate is moving and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can create it to be afraid of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ ing and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three Happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our che@@ eses @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ ted with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , rigid Brian and I sat down .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and have to pay our rent ?
the things came in roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers .
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus we presented our investors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly show pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the kind of room , whose doors one closes when you visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
indeed , they do not .
nobody who is still very Tro@@ st at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business that is stran@@ ger to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you agree on the things you can do . we could des@@ ig@@ s .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is overall experience .
we had learned how to disinf@@ ect objects but now we wanted to create immense confidence , between people who had never met before .
can design something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree confidence we asp@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone to your left seat .
this quietly get@@ away from panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most are feeling the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just sometimes who has actually Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ?
could you announce to the Office of the President for the President of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 assess@@ ments , which all say : &quot; he can really hold very good mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system will strengthen confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative assess@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and home .
little surprise we trust the people most that are most like us most .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre @-@ bi@@ ases .
thrilling is going to add the call of a person -- in our case by determin@@ ations .
if you have less than three determin@@ ations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation of similarities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you will award .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
you tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted rather .
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I have been doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the proper amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not reck@@ oned was the large amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was not covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ lawful parties celebrated or appart@@ ments devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests left in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it does hurt , if I only think of it .
the disappointment which you hear in the voice of the Andes , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , of the 123 million @-@ medi@@ ated nights had only a fraction of a problem .
for people are familiar to each other .
if trust works , you can embrace mir@@ ac@@ ulous .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to be car@@ cin@@ ated due to occup@@ ations .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real Guardian Angel that can save life even though they don &apos;t know correctly .
they drive one in your own car in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they will bring books past .
you can even stay longer without comp@@ ute the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay runs off .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this concept for the first time , I asked me :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is here about economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to call it , the case is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships .
people lay down a part of themselves and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group would wait there for Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a pub pent@@ agon neighborhood of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn for cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed for privacy according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like apartments set up from the ground up to the co @-@ operation ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of the common part ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in the South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parks , which belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a spell ,
were taught to people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ators started .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . our platform alone will be host of 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries today by a stran@@ ger or a host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has already been there before .
there were already similar sites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to contempl@@ ate every time when a red Maz@@ da passed to me .
we know of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if we could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , subjected to brain@@ washing , a terror ?
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent the way I look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their drivers .
for all those who have never met any Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ven@@ ge@@ eg@@ s @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ cal ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ lim@@ in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ th@@ ed me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist independence , and against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been w@@ ned with the Quran .
I read him , I thought , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the Rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineering company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end to bo@@ ast , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ unsubscribe . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ cks in buildings , people ran@@ smit@@ ters from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched on the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country under attack , but in N@@ u changed me the actions of others by a civil society in a susp@@ icious .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the study program .
I remember , as we swe@@ ep -- so deep it went into my seat square , and I was afraid to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ ine .
we moved into our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; Sei@@ d war@@ ns &quot; , &quot; ble@@ w into well @-@ lit areas , &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for the praying .
and again the warnings , &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or other people who held up for Muslims , and turned out into the outdoors .
there really was burnt attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I dis@@ miss the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to himself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one only keeps under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , First and Olympi@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques will be safer ?
it might stop a few parking spaces but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as I became a leader of the police in the Washington , Washington recently reported : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
in the Radi@@ cal process , one has noticed that he can cut online . as the first one is cut off the person from her church , even from their family , to make the extre@@ mes that believe the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ised their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS founded their brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as a muscle , as a mother , as a man , I think we must do everything to create a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if one thro@@ ws a look at them , it does not drive what they were las@@ hed in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they were told to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and said to her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into difficulties .
nothing is inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger , it was a main aim for the instrument@@ alization by extremi@@ sts who speak their solution .
this Ima@@ m presented the connection with God and her church again .
instead of protecting them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , did she keep to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear every day rely on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept more an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : if you have reported testing messages that have been reported negative about Muslims , they are rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an ac@@ adem@@ ical problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of Iraq war and two choices .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to the mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ sign .
we may sense it as the first , but the toxic air is scar@@ ed to all of us .
at the assignment of collec@@ tivity , it is not only about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising .
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous human being he knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was struck and said ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , her mur@@ dered as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon to visit . he did so in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted utter@@ ance against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page .
he poured out eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only am@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone for the mosque or we stayed safe at home ?
we contempl@@ ate it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about what America we want to leave to our children , one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the nursery , we headed off , with high @-@ pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , pulled my shoes out , went into the prayer hall , and what I looked , letting me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked himself and called our guests , for the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to help us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of anxiety and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go number safe ?
or will you join to those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might possibly claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a monument with drau@@ ght , in a class@@ y monument , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual how it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is just before to become a million business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ pact in our social consciousness has inv@@ aded an autonomous fleet of air machines in F@@ RAC Centre in France a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
through connecting air devices , you can reach high speed and spe@@ eding up to eng@@ ages .
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ date structures .
they have learned to wear bur@@ dens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight .
so that a system aut@@ om function , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for the current demo@@ s we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings and all our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each air@@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level of eb@@ . e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two compartments with a fla@@ p .
as other starter regul@@ ators it is efficient in the forward @-@ looking flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters you can float it , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a ch@@ ap .
a restriction of tri@@ angular is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air unit does not matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions which are to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known to hurt you .
recently trained pil@@ ots could fly @-@ controlled air devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ oring .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote machine . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hinges and trans@@ cription , no further actu@@ ator or inspec@@ tors , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically straightforward , it happens in the inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move in space .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tri@@ angular shape . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it correctly if all of me watch is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ ace is an exercise in Gen@@ u@@ lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thereby he gets the most important skill ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors .
some of them is conceivable in models , the rest will be learned directly at the fly .
let &apos;s look at this .
when air presses should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aer@@ on@@ ers machines .
this is rotating in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , al@@ beit limited .
we will demonstrate that by doing a half .
the last demonstration is examined synthetic swe@@ ep@@ ts .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the negoti@@ able Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with localization technology and algorithms .
every unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ consider new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there , on Broadway , I want to be a f@@ arewell lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us lies the reward in the development and the work act .
it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures allowed to form it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1.3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are getting faster , they turned into so the mass of thirteen others in a tenth of a tenth of energy around .
this short moment he acknowledged it more brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy does not put them in form of light --
we are finally talking about black holes .
the whole energy was handed over to the space @-@ time p@@ adding itself and the universe explo@@ ded in the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events for the first time .
1.3 billion years ago was originated in the earth for a multi @-@ day life .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , su@@ rier , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially coura@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss of M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- create a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they thought they are crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ rium gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase in what the recognition power is enormous .
that is why you now call it Advanced LIG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O started for a final test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional as these :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all this for which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at M@@ IT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ra waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a bu@@ oy@@ ancy in the sym@@ biosis of space and time .
to pass , the wave will be stretched over the space and its entire content into one direction and is stretched into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers lead in courses to rel@@ ativity theory often a true al@@ ber@@ ant dance .
&quot; stretching and shr@@ ubs , stretch and shr@@ ubs . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out by us during the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high @-@ 21 .
this is equivalent to 20 zer@@ oes after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Therefore , the LIG@@ O employees declared for crazy .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ Os , hunting for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are Finnish and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claims , LIG@@ O is more than one eye than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
clear@@ er light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial lifts , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite handy . because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you .
when tones is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean to you :
the face of your child around .
instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now talks about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob put them down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mmer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can not make easy pictures of objects in the universe with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert ri@@ pping patterns in circuits , we can hear the universe literally .
the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a collision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cling simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement liter@@ al , shaped into the shaft .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hearing LIG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ i sound &#93; Som@@ me , who knows what he must listen , this is as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rot@@ ate about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : let us know what that means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 others , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , orbit@@ ing a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O is a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ se@@ mary stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon .
we will never see , because this op@@ a@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Ur@@ qu@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is covered through his own reflection .
with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the start .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , LIG@@ O found right in the first attempt things we did not expect .
my colleague on M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this subject : me : the kind of stars , the black holes emerged , as LIG@@ O they are observed are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
you are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ ction cups for our archaeological work .
LIG@@ O offers us a completely different angle on the events in space , at the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as coura@@ geous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the ru@@ stling and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be more beautiful than that of the jungle ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous to say me in unpleasant situations , I have to say &quot; yes &quot; to say .
did I talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the swing ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just that which I feared , because I feared my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that my life changed deeply , on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ gency . and Emer@@ gency , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I need milk for my be@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from here I am swe@@ eten to play with them whenever you do me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I ask myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an intrigu@@ ing side @-@ effect : only recently , I actually completely understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children I saved my career .
I have a real dream@@ job .
I am Auth@@ ors . I think things out , go to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I manufacture television .
I make TV , in a big style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows are running on Thursday night .
on the whole world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ous . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV shows , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , who burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say it to you , that all of you who work as hard as you do a company , a country or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I am not just ro@@ aming your computer and f@@ anta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that there is no dre@@ aming during a dream@@ job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I have deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is , when I put troops on the way I put on a canvas .
this is the better sound that you have a high sound , lying a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting , and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and black@@ ish , cru@@ el and mother@@ ly , cru@@ el and rational , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me if the work is going well .
a money begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for always on her .
many people take their money when writing them to them that I &apos;m writing writing to me that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it .
but the money -- when I began to work with the TV production , when I began working and to work , to build and work together , I discovered this thing , this money , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the money is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the money is music . the sums of money is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive different from its size .
the feeling that can not be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is a ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I just know that I was not being made for failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz .
I only want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it into question .
to make a clear question : the more successful I will , the more ship@@ ments , the more re@@ bound@@ ed limits , the more work there , the more watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon that I have run , the army , the high sound , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the tot@@ als .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this money ?
and then stops the bu@@ zz .
revised , over@@ estimated , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single place of work .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ gency says : &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
it is the children of a title .
you are a Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums appeared .
the sums of the motor is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my money was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , passed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing else , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all @-@ hearted , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me there was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and money I was .
so what to do , if what you do is doing the work you love , suddenly remaining ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ay you from , sil@@ ly the author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you are doing , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , a mother to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sums you knew , if the sums stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say NO , as I become aware of two things :
first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , they called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
I don &apos;t miss it when I am Titan and my sums , and here everything changes my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes &quot; .
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and protect their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and the lack of the sw@@ amp , I cannot do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon that I have run , the army , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax pins and the song , in which it is slo@@ gans , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Age &quot; can be released .
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy club comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the money comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the fix@@ ture , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe my brain with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the money is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the current , which comes from lust for life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real money is self @-@ confidence and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real money ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the expectation tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real money is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I usually do this , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the money again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing not as I like to work like that .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at work as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of person prefer to be a home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am so relaxed is none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ unt soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I am always working according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live and the sums of the universe fulfilled me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped using the game ?
you can also say it ! yes , they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream@@ holiday .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , up to them sh@@ elled that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ck or K@@ eks replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ y @-@ daughter for a whole of fifteen minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need it not .
everyone can bring about 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad weather day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are praying .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my welfare , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to have the money to have a place for his soul .
it is not about playing with their own kids . it is about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it out .
I am not perfect in it . I cry and I want to make friends read books , read the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands soon for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not get in full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the sums would then return if I am not working .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a couple of months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . it turns me to new ideas . I take advantage of it in full respect and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not I ... not anymore .
soap and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the money of work is part of me , but just one part . and for this I am so thankful .
it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money , the marathon that I have stopped , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right money : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this money , the more this unusual , driving , naked and new feeling of feeling inside me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this money , the more I know who I am .
I am Auth@@ ors . I think things out , I awake to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream@@ job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke , or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capability for self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was surgical neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
surely they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; low @-@ hir@@ n@@ ud@@ der . &quot; here , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the control circuits of the neur@@ ons that enhances the neurological functions .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean by Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to us .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading upper physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I received patients with sk@@ ull @-@ stags trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd &apos;s trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is tw@@ ined and the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save lives , one has to l@@ ending the sk@@ ull pressure .
therefore one has to sometimes remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells of one tissue , is comparable with very small children which are taken out of their families .
you need to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you are still aware of the Bi@@ ologi@@ an Less@@ ons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small incl@@ ine of the brain .
it is surprising to sustain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells stopped different .
they were slow and after a couple of weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like tri@@ bal cells , but differs differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our big hir@@ n@@ rin@@ den@@ ess cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain bre@@ aches .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
this is what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they subsequently highlight colored to be able to follow in the brain .
in the last step we ple@@ aded them at the Ent@@ rance of the same Individu@@ al .
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ spl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we pl@@ ore these cells in normal brain tissues ? and what will happen if we ple@@ ad the same cells in dig@@ ni@@ ble brain tissues ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with Mon@@ keys .
in the first scenario , we ple@@ aded the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and r@@ hy@@ ming exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that are im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small d@@ ots . these are the cells we in@@ duced in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
are these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain infringement ?
so , we used monkeys with a manual de@@ x@@ ter@@ ment task .
you had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we last in the motor@@ ic Cor@@ tex the mot@@ echn@@ ology area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen with people , they rest up spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ ular brain mechanisms . they are reco@@ vering to some degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that reco@@ vering this spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now let &apos;s see when we pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells out : the same monkey , two months after the plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use them freezing and later use .
we can use it in other neurological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain is the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I am certain that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centralized study .
you must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider her as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changing physical .
we believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing clearly proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe in cooperation with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy but that we need a truly and def@@ ective democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are st@@ ating , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the topic of wast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ Summit paradox@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few are recognizing from its Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , is to be anxi@@ ous to invest it there where it would be productive and income as well , with which one could wear the Scho@@ den@@ berg and also all the things that mankind is urgently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the euro area , 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , gases , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars is after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which were ro@@ uted at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices uploaded .
so debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin Summit that are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 years old in the USA , Japan and Europe , and thus promoting a low overall economic demand that could not invest in the end loop , in which they do not invest . precisely such as O@@ edi@@ pus father , who could not invest in fear , the prophecy of the O@@ missi@@ le might be true that his son would kill him if he grows .
ignor@@ ant the circumstances causes that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills it .
this is my ha@@ sty with capitalism --
its extremely v@@ ending article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue , what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form , in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy naturally joined many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be an error to reduce the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these outputs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it gave them the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they have the right to political co@@ determination with equal mo@@ ods in questions of state switching .
the ath@@ ic democracy has not been held for a long time --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly burned .
however our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based upon the values of the Magna C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has entered politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our democr@@ acies in today &apos;s democr@@ acies since the time when this separation between politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of which the economy is gradually mig@@ rated to politics .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics is un@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ sten with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which she nour@@ ished , dec@@ imal that it is star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy which the policy has so far can@@ ni@@ fied through the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their business .
the more successful the capitalism has exp@@ elled the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ rit@@ ing apples , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to merge the politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; retain control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t son@@ ly good .
the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ bet@@ s through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation leaves the tw@@ ins summit higher , the wast@@ ing , and social conflicts lower , just as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we do the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological monitoring @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the movie &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation .
so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive .
the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a D@@ yst@@ eine , similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what was it , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ eine ?
in the practical implementation I would like to inform you in all the short , some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market , where you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a work@@ station to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income derived from capital and from degra@@ ding and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those belonging to the companies , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , however , do not belong to the company . no diving attract more between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and as@@ par@@ es , and ultimately no secondary igni@@ tion apple .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce yourself shortly before , that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , imagine that all world trade is acted in this currency -- we call them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment is ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference by 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have it , especially against the background of a unified politics and economy .
the world that I describe , is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which they privileged people preferred , and Marxist , because they are buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ isch .
but above all else , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ eine ?
the answer depends on how we decide on politically .
it is in our hands and we do better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography themselves as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just told is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... do we do not work , technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mon as &quot; long term st@@ agnation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the trans@@ ference of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one we &apos;re currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ al democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ler Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are at ease .
Y@@ V : if you are not busy , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you consider from the perspective of the West on China .
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a fully democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles today to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now resembles very much the evolution that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now is propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I am sure that a lot of li@@ sten@@ ers are curious about your experiences as the minister of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , of the self @-@ suffici@@ ency to say goodbye , and the continuous denial that a massive extension line was passed through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was to open this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European @-@ group , continue to deny the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try a business system , which is not over@@ able to obtain through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will perhaps delay a while , but if the shift occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims for 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I did mistake .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they merely wanted to bring our government to a case , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the don@@ ors who put this policy imposed on us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ti@@ ons of the conversations , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the eurozone has not survived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they have not survived , the acqu@@ itted pin@@ acle will be demon@@ ic and destroying the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be alone for Europe to cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we ourselves allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears , it will be as well tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tive at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy did not select any one .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner .
this curve is the measurement distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b site . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
if your show will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; The Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , which are addi@@ ctive , where , after having seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , are shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- which should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to offer &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thought about the mean explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a bit , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he accepts many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at any cost .
and if Amazon gives nothing short of stuff there is to be right ?
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
however they don &apos;t know that they are observed during the viewing of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show when you load , which parts you jumps , or look around .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show them should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people remember this show because they were not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this information to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors have .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; house of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has got a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this corner . that is exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because logic somehow suggests that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data to make a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optimize it by very powerful computers .
the minus what you can expect is good television , or ?
when data analysis does not work , this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we hold more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that may be very bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . that &apos;s not because a company such as multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data diversi@@ fied companies are times wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 Google announced that they can tell through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , of the lim@@ b type , can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great message sensation . the success was in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round , until it suddenly fails to work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google will sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all of these errors , data flows in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the judicial procedure , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
must you ever solve a complex problem , do mostly two things :
as a stes , you dis@@ integrate this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a wide @-@ wide you set the parts again to summar@@ ize a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to comp@@ ose the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to comp@@ ose again , even if the information is incomplete to then hold a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong to the process .
they use data to better understand their public what else would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all of these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; house of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all its decisions , first as they w@@ ned by TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only have to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will spread it later with a technology demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you can of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit of well @-@ wise , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the building .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and clever and clever . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do is doing and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the corner .
thanks beautiful .
