<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because it won as a New York Times reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA / Phones of Americans have heard.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA is literally drafts to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters have not liked?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "nearly 10 years, the government has been determined against reisen and called upon it to call its alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and to defeat journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish the secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was crowned with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although she had years for years that it would be imperative for their fall, the demands of the government were dropped by reisen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and rationally to make statements, this could also take care of their digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his phone calls are secretly concerned,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even travel instructions with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistle-blowers and Risens supposed source to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his attack. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of having a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the media work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutionally, because the government has more and more possibilities to put all off." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to circumventing the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can write it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the follow-up, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not yet been written as a reisen book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source batch conversion system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet artery, which was developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation when I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the one here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with every ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server in which only the respective message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretion, and many of the information that she would ask, would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that hinders us all." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is very important to us to ensure that not only technology burner like Edward Snowden have a way to get distraction. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The alarm will tell about abnormalities in the care of soldiers humble and will report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental miter, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint suggests. or a pilgrim insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest datasheck of the story published.] [what does that mean?] [we bans Robert Palmer from Global Witness on a statement.] this week we were sent out news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a bellows of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad envelope in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollar leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's plantations, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and the next revealing documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we see what happened?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of its taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, this disclosure are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and entrust their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschka.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these commandments.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans before in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosks Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a datasheck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, it needs less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed the employee from the debtor to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been scammers allowed to dipping particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered investigator in the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone was up to a lawyer of our investigator's suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prevocations. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course not handed over money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer made by our covert investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single peak of leaders, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, established by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound utterly practising, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when born, I see quite sure that some things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last couple of years we have seen sorties to more transparency which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at a national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging over here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this enormous insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the projectors.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, who stand up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work out to end this type of inconsistency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally finish the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red maMazowes.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my trial studies, I made a backhoon sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where did you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know it yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Must I now offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't know it just before! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I will not kidnapped in the luggage room of the Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard that," "" "I have a balloon. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "h, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh husband! what have I made me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien is in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got out of the bed, on the tenth to the door, and my sleeping-room enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me is now in his classrooms. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"" "" "" "people on my air mattresses became normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a short walk, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can create it to be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mating and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three Happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheeses-ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We touted with them through the whole city. as we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, rigid Brian and I sat down.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and have to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"" "thus we presented our investors:" "" "we want to create a website where people publicly show pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the kind of room, whose doors one closes when you visit." ""</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still very Trost at Trost, would invest in a business that is stranger to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you agree on the things you can do. we could desigs.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to disinfect objects but now we wanted to create immense confidence, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree confidence we asped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly getaway from panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are feeling the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just sometimes who has actually Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce to the Office of the President for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name; if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments, which all say: "he can really hold very good mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system will strengthen confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted with Stanford a study. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust the people most that are most like us most.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pre-biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling is going to add the call of a person -- in our case by determinations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three determinations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you will award.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, such as "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">You tells a lot, as for example: "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted rather.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I have been doing with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the proper amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckoned was the large amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unlawful parties celebrated or appartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it does hurt, if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which you hear in the voice of the Andes, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million-mediated nights had only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, you can embrace miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to be carcinated due to occupations.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian Angel that can save life even though they don't know correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in your own car in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they will bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without compute the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay runs off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this concept for the first time, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is here about economic trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "rent" "" "to call it, the case is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay down a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group would wait there for Answer to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a pub pentagon neighborhood of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn for cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed for privacy according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like apartments set up from the ground up to the co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parks, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a spell,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved. there were incubators started.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. our platform alone will be host of 785 000 people in 191 countries today by a stranger or a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has already been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to contemplate every time when a red Mazda passed to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if we could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, subjected to brainwashing, a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent the way I look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met any Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sevengeegs-fitness fanatical,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outhed me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head coverage.</seg>

<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end to boast, looked upon the screen and saw the word "Eilunsubscribe."</seg>

<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country under attack, but in Nu changed me the actions of others by a civil society in a suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the study program.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we sweep -- so deep it went into my seat square, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslimine.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be watchful," Seid warns "," blew into well-lit areas, "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for the praying.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings, "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or other people who held up for Muslims, and turned out into the outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was burnt attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I dismiss the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to himself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor one only keeps under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, First and Olympiics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques will be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might stop a few parking spaces but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I became a leader of the police in the Washington, Washington recently reported: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Radical process, one has noticed that he can cut online. as the first one is cut off the person from her church, even from their family, to make the extremes that believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despised their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS founded their brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a muscle, as a mother, as a man, I think we must do everything to create a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology" "" "on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">But if one throws a look at them, it does not drive what they were lashed in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they were told to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and said to her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing is inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger, it was a main aim for the instrumentalization by extremists who speak their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection with God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of protecting them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, did she keep to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear every day rely on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you have reported testing messages that have been reported negative about Muslims, they are rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academical problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of Iraq war and two choices.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to the moslem terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to undermining the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early Warnsign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may sense it as the first, but the toxic air is scared to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">At the assignment of collectivity, it is not only about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, promising.</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous human being he knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was struck and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a diversified young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, her murdered as well as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon to visit. he did so in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted utterance against Muslims on his facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He poured out eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only amoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone for the mosque or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We contemplate it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about what America we want to leave to our children, one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery, we headed off, with high-pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled my shoes out, went into the prayer hall, and what I looked, letting me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and called our guests, for the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers, and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might possibly claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a monument with draught, in a classy monument, that is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for crafting, is just before to become a million business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-pact in our social consciousness has invaded an autonomous fleet of air machines in FRAC Centre in France a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through connecting air devices, you can reach high speed and speeding up to engages.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up-to-date structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear burdens, deal with turmoil and to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autom function, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the current demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a offsprings and all our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each airmachine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level of eb. e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two compartments with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other starter regulators it is efficient in the forward-looking flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters you can float it, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a chap.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of triangular is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air unit does not matter in which position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions which are to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Recently trained pilots could fly-controlled air devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailoring.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transcription, no further actuator or inspectors, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically straightforward, it happens in the inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the triangular shape. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it correctly if all of me watch is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospace is an exercise in Genuloneliness, this machine is here, the omkopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he gets the most important skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers from the eight propellors.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of them is conceivable in models, the rest will be learned directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When air presses should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aeroners machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is rotating in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is examined synthetic sweepts.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the negotiable Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to reconsider new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there, on Broadway, I want to be a farewell lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the reward in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever creatures allowed to form it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago circled in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are getting faster, they turned into so the mass of thirteen others in a tenth of a tenth of energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment he acknowledged it more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy does not put them in form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We are finally talking about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was handed over to the space-time padding itself and the universe exploded in the gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was originated in the earth for a multi-day life.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, surier, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- create a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they thought they are crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometrium gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase in what the recognition power is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why you now call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO started for a final test run by some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional as these:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this for which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitra waves from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a buoyancy in the symbiosis of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">To pass, the wave will be stretched over the space and its entire content into one direction and is stretched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers lead in courses to relativity theory often a true alberant dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and shrubs, stretch and shrubs."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out by us during the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high-21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is equivalent to 20 zeroes after the comma, followed by a 1. Therefore, the LIGO employees declared for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting for the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are Finnish and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more than one eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Clearer light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial lifts, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child around.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now talks about Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob put them down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to the gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not make easy pictures of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert ripping patterns in circuits, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about a collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circling simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional sound change. this sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement literal, shaped into the shaft.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hearing LIGO the following: [Surreni sound] Somme, who knows what he must listen, this is as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us know what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 others, the other with a mass of 36 probes, orbiting a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massemary stars explode in Supernovas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because this opaak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Urquall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is covered through his own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: me: the kind of stars, the black holes emerged, as LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">You are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO offers us a completely different angle on the events in space, at the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible.</seg>

<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment out.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous to say me in unpleasant situations, I have to say "yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just that which I feared, because I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that my life changed deeply, on an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emergency. and Emergency, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="570">When it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beaks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from here I am sweeten to play with them whenever you do me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I ask myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side-effect: only recently, I actually completely understood that the "yes" to play with my children I saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am Authors. I think things out, go to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I manufacture television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows are running on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">On the whole world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendous. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV shows, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, who burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, that all of you who work as hard as you do a company, a country or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I am not just roaming your computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say, I understand that there is no dreaming during a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I have deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I put troops on the way I put on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is the better sound that you have a high sound, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting, and intoxicating, funny and blackish, cruel and motherly, cruel and rational, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A money begins in my head, and it grows and grows and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for always on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take their money when writing them to them that I'm writing writing to me that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the money -- when I began to work with the TV production, when I began working and to work, to build and work together, I discovered this thing, this money, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The money is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the sums of money is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive different from its size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that can not be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is a ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I was not being made for failure, and I know only that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear question: the more successful I will, the more shipments, the more rebounded limits, the more work there, the more watch me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon that I have run, the army, the high sound, the sums, the buzz, the buzz, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this money?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overestimated, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single place of work.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emergency says: "I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a title.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums appeared.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the motor is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, passed weekends, no remorse, nothing else, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all-hearted, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Pre-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what to do, if what you do is doing the work you love, suddenly remaining?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hay you from, silly the author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you are doing, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, a mother to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sums you knew, if the sums stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stop, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "makes me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say NO, as I become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to all and secondly, they called me not "" "" kittens. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "" "" "" "" "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I don't miss it when I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes".</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and protect their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and the lack of the swamp, I cannot do anything except to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon that I have run, the army, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax pins and the song, in which it is slogans, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Age" can be released.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the fixture, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe my brain with broadcasts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current, which comes from lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">"" "" "" "real money is self-confidence and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="712">The real money ignores the pressure of the story, the expectation tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to God the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually do this, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the money again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing not as I like to work like that.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what kind of person prefer to be a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am so relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden around, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crunt soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always working according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the sums of the universe fulfilled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped using the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! yes, they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daydreamholiday.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, up to them shelled that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkck or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teeny-daughter for a whole of fifteen minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring about 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad weather day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are praying.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to have the money to have a place for his soul.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own kids. it is about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play the" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I cry and I want to make friends read books, read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands soon for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to excel myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the sums would then return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a couple of months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. it turns me to new ideas. I take advantage of it in full respect and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not I... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The money of work is part of me, but just one part. and for this I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the money, the marathon that I have stopped, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the other, the right money: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this money, the more this unusual, driving, naked and new feeling of feeling inside me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this money, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am Authors. I think things out, I awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke, or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard from one of the most well-known, the "low-hirnudder." here, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the control circuits of the neurons that enhances the neurological functions.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean by Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to us.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading upper physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I received patients with skull-stags trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that in skull-shepherd's traumata the brain is twined and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, one has to lending the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Therefore one has to sometimes remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells of one tissue, is comparable with very small children which are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the Biologian Lessons that stem cells unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small incline of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to sustain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like tribal cells, but differs differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our big hirnrindeness cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain breaches.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to find a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight colored to be able to follow in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we pleaded them at the Entrance of the same Individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we plore these cells in normal brain tissues? and what will happen if we plead the same cells in dignible brain tissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with Monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we pleaded the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and rhyming exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that are implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small dots. these are the cells we induced in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain infringement?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we used monkeys with a manual dexterment task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we last in the motoric Cortex the motechnology area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they rest up spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastificular brain mechanisms. they are recovering to some degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovering this spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now let's see when we plagued the cells out: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neurological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain is the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am certain that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centralized study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider her as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchanging physical.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing clearly proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in cooperation with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy but that we need a truly and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are stating, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "on the topic of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently our economies." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "" "" twin-Summit paradoxes. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schodenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few are recognizing from its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which, however, is to be anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and income as well, with which one could wear the Schodenberg and also all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the euro area, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, gases, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars is after a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion dollars, which were routed at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices uploaded.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debts and unproductive capital form the twin Summit that are not equated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 years old in the USA, Japan and Europe, and thus promoting a low overall economic demand that could not invest in the end loop, in which they do not invest. precisely such as Oedipus father, who could not invest in fear, the prophecy of the Omissile might be true that his son would kill him if he grows.</seg>
<seg id="925">Ignorant the circumstances causes that oedipus kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasty with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely vending article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue, what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form, in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy naturally joined many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be an error to reduce the significance of the athic democracy due to these outputs." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athic democracy was and is that it gave them the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they have the right to political codetermination with equal moods in questions of state switching.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based upon the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has entered politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was established." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies in today's democracies since the time when this separation between politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of which the economy is gradually migrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics is unandered into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hasten with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators, which so sustainably the animals, of which she nourished, decimal that it is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy which the policy has so far cannified through the self-caused economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their business.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful the capitalism has expelled the "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twriting apples, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we have to merge the politics and the economy and it would be better if the "Demos" retain control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't sonly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing Niedriglobets through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation leaves the twins summit higher, the wasting, and social conflicts lower, just as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to re-shape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we do the re-unified area, otherwise we end in a pathological monitoring-hyperautocracy that leaves the movie "matrix" like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The interestingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a Dysteine, similar to that of society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what was it, how could it look to have this "star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" -similar Dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to inform you in all the short, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market, where you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a workstation to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income derived from capital and from degrading and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those belonging to the companies, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, however, do not belong to the company. no diving attract more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and aspares, and ultimately no secondary ignition apple.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce yourself shortly before, that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "furthermore, imagine that all world trade is acted in this currency -- we call them" "" "the Cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "Cosmos" "" "and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that these funds are investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment is rar." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference by 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have it, especially against the background of a unified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe, is simultaneously liberated, in which they privileged people preferred, and Marxist, because they are buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, global keynesianisch.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide on politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography themselves as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just told is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... do we do not work, technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summon as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transference of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one we're currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertler Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not busy, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you consider from the perspective of the West on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say this provocative, China resembles today to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now resembles very much the evolution that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now is proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that a lot of listeners are curious about your experiences as the minister of Greece beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this comes.</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, of the self-sufficiency to say goodbye, and the continuous denial that a massive extension line was passed through the eurozone and continues to massively threatens the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was to open this denial --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European-group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try a business system, which is not overable to obtain through political will and authoritarianism, it will perhaps delay a while, but if the shift occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductive at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy did not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the measurement distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb site. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows how "Breaking Bad," "The Game of Thrones," The Wire "-- all the shows, which are addictive, where, after having seen a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, are shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- which should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to offer" toddlers and Tiaras "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thought about the mean exploiters, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a bit, that's why Roy Price does not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He accepts many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at any cost.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives nothing short of stuff there is to be right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they don't know that they are observed during the viewing of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show when you load, which parts you jumps, or look around.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from it results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many people remember this show because they were not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,4 amounts and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design by Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this information to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors have.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "house of Cards." Netflix has got a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this corner. that is exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow suggests that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data to make a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minus what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work, this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we hold more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that may be very bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. that's not because a company such as multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data diversified companies are times wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announced that they can tell through data analysis outbreaks of flu, of the limb type, can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great message sensation. the success was in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round, until it suddenly fails to work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google will sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all of these errors, data flows in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the judicial procedure, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Must you ever solve a complex problem, do mostly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a stes, you disintegrate this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a wide-wide you set the parts again to summarize a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete to then hold a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think that Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their public what else would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all of these parts, put together again and make a show like "house of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all its decisions, first as they wned by TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only have to shake the ball in order to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will spread it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit of well-wise, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is wiser and clever and clever. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do is doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the corner.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
